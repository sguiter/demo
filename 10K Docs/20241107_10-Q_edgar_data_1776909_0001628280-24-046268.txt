 Impairment Assessment 
 The Company s primary business model is subscription-based as opposed to a model based on generating revenues at a specific title level.

If such changes are identified, the aggregated content library will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs are written off for content assets that have been, or are expected to be abandoned. 
 Amortization 
 In accordance with its accounting policy for content assets, the Company amortizes licensed content costs and produced content costs, which is included within cost of revenues in the Company s unaudited consolidated statements of operations.

 Stock options and RSU awards generally vest on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over a period of one to from the grant date.

Upon vesting and distribution of RSUs, the Company issues previously unissued shares of Common Stock to satisfy RSUs vested, net of shares withheld for taxes if elected by the RSU holder. 
 The fair value of stock option awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes a number of assumptions including the Company s estimates of stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, future dividend payments, and risk-free interest rates. 
 The expected term of options granted is the estimated period of time from the beginning of the vesting period to the date of expected exercise or other settlement, based on historical exercises and post-vesting terminations. The Company generally estimates expected term based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term, also known as the simplified method, given the lack of historical exercise behavior.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, operating loss was 3.3 million and 23.9 million, respectively. The decline in operating loss of 20.6 million, or 86 , primarily resulted from the decreases in our operating expenses of 23.7 million, or 60 , which more than offset the decline in revenues of 3.0 million, or 19 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This significant decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to the absence of prior-year impairment charges recorded in relation to our content assets, as discussed in the section below. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, net loss was 3.1 million and 26.6 million, respectively, a decrease in net loss of 23.5 million, or 88 .

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, operating loss was 9.5 million and 39.7 million, respectively. The decline in operating loss of 30.3 million, or 76 , primarily resulted from the decreases in our operating expenses of 35.4 million, or 43 , which more than offset the decline in revenues of 5.1 million, or 12 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This significant decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to the absence of prior-year impairment charges recorded in relation to our content assets, as discussed in the section below. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, net loss was 10.1 million and 44.2 million, respectively, a decrease in net loss of 34.1 million, or 77 . 
 Our future operating results and cash flows are dependent upon a number of opportunities, challenges, and other factors, including our ability to efficiently grow our subscriber base, increase our prices and expand our service offerings to maximize subscriber lifetime value. 
 
 Revenue 
 Since the Company was founded in 2015, we have generated the majority of our revenues from consumers directly accessing our content in the form of monthly or annual subscription plans. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, revenues totaled 12.6 million and 15.6 million, respectively, a decrease of 3.0 million, or 19 . This decline was primarily driven by declines in Content Licensing and Bundled Distribution of 3.4 million and 0.5 million, respectively, while our Direct Business revenue increased by 1.1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, revenues totaled 37.0 million and 42.1 million, respectively, a decrease of 5.1 million, or 12 . This decline was primarily driven by declines in Content Licensing and Bundled Distribution of 6.6 million and 1.1 million, respectively, while our Direct Business revenue increased by 3.5 million, or 13 . 
 Direct Business 
 Our Direct Business revenue is derived from consumers subscribing directly through our owned and operated website O O Consumer Service ), mobile applications developed for iOS and Android operating systems App Services and through Partner Direct relationships. Our O O Consumer Service is available in more than 175 countries to any household with a broadband connection. Our App Services enable access to CuriosityStream on almost every major consumer device, including streaming media players like Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, major smart TV brands (e.g., LG, Vizio, Samsung) and gaming consoles. 
 We began implementing a price increase for legacy subscribers in March 2023, starting with English-speaking countries, and it has now been applied globally across all markets. This adjustment impacts the majority of our Direct Business revenue. Alongside our standard subscription, we continue to offer the Smart Bundle service, which includes access to Tastemade, Kidstream, SommTV, and Curiosity University, with its current pricing unchanged. Future adjustments to these subscription plans may be considered to further enhance revenue from this segment. 
 The multichannel video programming distributors MVPDs ), virtual MVPDs vMVPDs and digital distributor partners making up our Partner Direct pay us a license fee for sales to individuals who subscribe to CuriosityStream via the partners respective platforms. We have affiliate agreement relationships with, and our service is available directly from major MVPDs that include Comcast, Cox, and Dish, and vMVPDs and digital distributors that include Amazon Prime Video Channels, Apple Channel, Roku Channel, Sling TV and YouTube TV.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Direct-to-Consumer revenue increased by 0.4 million, or 5 , compared to 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Direct-to-Consumer (or DTC) revenue increased by 1.7 million, or 8 , compared to 2023. Although our overall DTC subscriber count declined, this was more than offset by the higher pricing we began rolling out in 2023. Additionally, our Partner Direct primarily benefited from continued subscriber growth as well as the price increase. 
 Content Licensing 
 Through our Content Licensing business, we license to certain media companies a collection of existing titles from our content library. We also pre-sell selected rights (such as in territories or on platforms that are lower priority for us) to content we create before we even begin production. This latter model reduces risk in our content development decisions and creates content licensing revenue.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, Library sales decreased by 67 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023, Library sales decreased by 59 , while presales declined by 74 . 
 The decrease in Library sales for both periods is primarily due to a higher volume of trade and barter deals in the comparable periods of the prior year, which did not recur at the same level in the reported periods. Content licensing, including barter activity, may vary from period to period based on our content needs as well as those of our partners. Within our content licensing business, our primary focus is on transactions that yield a positive gross margin, particularly those related to our library. However, we may continue to enter into presale arrangements with certain partners for strategic purposes. 
 Bundled Distribution 
 Our Bundled Distribution business includes affiliate relationships with our Bundled MVPD and vMVPD partners, which are broadband and wireless companies in the U.S. and international territories to whom we can offer a broad scope of rights, including 24/7 linear channels, our video-on-demand content library, mobile rights and pricing and packaging flexibility, in exchange for an annual fixed fee or fee per subscriber.

Table of Contents 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our Bundled Distribution revenue was 1.0 million and 1.5 million, respectively, reflecting a 33 decline. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our Bundled Distribution revenue was 3.2 million and 4.3 million, respectively, reflecting a 26 decline. In both periods, the decrease was primarily the result of revised affiliate agreements and the non-renewal of certain partnerships. Bundled Distribution remains a challenging business given the ongoing disruption in the linear pay television business worldwide. 
 Other 
 We provide advertising and sponsorships services through developing integrated digital brand partnerships designed to offer the chance to be associated with CuriosityStream content in a variety of forms, including short- and long-form program integration; branded social media promotional videos; broadcast advertising spots in our video and audio programs that are made available on our linear programming channels or in front of the paywall; and our increasing focus on digital display ads while delivering our content through advertising-based video-on-demand (AVOD), transactional video-on-demand (TVOD), free advertising-supported streaming television (FAST), YouTube and other similar distribution channels. 
 In the future, we hope to continue developing integrated digital brand partnerships with advertisers. These sponsorship campaigns offer companies the chance to be associated with CuriosityStream content in the forms described above. We believe the impressions accumulated in these multi-faceted campaigns would result in verifiable metrics for the clients. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Other revenue was 0.2 million, a decline of 0.2 million, or 56 , from the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other revenue was 0.4 million, a decline of 0.9 million, or 67 , from the same period in 2023. These declines were largely due to certain short-term marketing partnerships that we entered into during the early part of 2023, including a campaign that we provided through a trade and barter arrangement that was not renewed in 2024. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our primary operating costs relate to the cost of producing and acquiring our content, the costs of advertising and marketing our service, personnel costs, and distribution fees. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our operating expenses were 15.9 million and 39.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 23.7 million, or 60 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our operating expenses were 46.5 million and 81.8 million, respectively, a decrease of 35.4 million, or 43 . 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues encompasses content amortization, distribution fees, revenue sharing arrangements, hosting and streaming delivery costs, payment processing costs, commission costs, and subtitling and broadcast costs. Producing and co-producing content and commissioned content is generally more costly than content acquired through licenses. 
 Distribution fees include payment processing fees and revenue share arrangements with Smart Bundle and digital distributor partners, as well as fees owed to the Spiegel Venture related to JV's streaming service. We pay a fixed percentage distribution fee to our partners for subscribers accessing our platform via App Services to compensate these partners for access to their customer and subscriber bases. The MVPD, vMVPD and digital distributor partners making up our Partner Direct business pay us a license fee, and host and stream our content to their customers via their own platforms, such as set top boxes in the case of most MVPDs. We do not incur billing, streaming or backend costs associated with content distribution through our MVPD, vMVPD and digital distributor partners.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues decreased to 5.8 million from 8.5 million, a 31 reduction. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenues decreased to 18.6 million from 27.4 million, a 32 reduction. These decreases were primarily driven by declines in content amortization of 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and of 18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to fewer new productions, a reduction in content acquisitions and releases during the year and the content impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, other costs of revenues declined mainly due to a reduction in revenue share arrangements, including our arrangement with Nebula that expired at the end of 2023. 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 Our advertising and marketing expenditures are a primary operating cost for our business. While these costs may fluctuate based on advertising and marketing objectives, we generally focus marketing dollars on efficient customer acquisition methods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 1.5 million and 2.7 million, respectively compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease reflects our efforts to optimize spending while maintaining our market presence and continuing to invest in strategic initiatives aimed at driving growth. 
 General and Administrative 
 Our general and administrative costs are associated with certain administrative functions, including corporate governance, executive management, information technology, finance and human resources. These costs consist largely of compensation expense, subscriptions that support our business, professional services, licenses and rent. While personnel levels may fluctuate based on our needs, we tend to focus on hiring and retaining revenue-generating personnel, such as sales staff and roles that support the improvement, maintenance and marketing of our different revenue streams.

Table of Contents 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.4 million from 7.0 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease of 0.5 million, or 8 , was primarily the result of lower payroll and related costs and professional services, which declined by 1.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively. The reduction in payroll costs was mainly driven by a smaller average workforce size and reduced incentive compensation. Additionally, professional services costs decreased by 55 as we streamlined various external services and brought certain finance and operations functions in-house. Stock-based compensation increased by 1.8 million, reflecting performance-based RSUs granted during the period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased to 18.2 million from 23.0 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease of 4.8 million, or 21 , was primarily the result of lower payroll and related costs and professional services, which declined by 3.0 million and 2.3 million, respectively. The reduction in payroll costs was mainly driven by a smaller average workforce size and reduced incentive compensation. Additionally, professional services costs decreased by 48 as we streamlined various external services and brought certain finance and operations functions in-house. Stock-based compensation increased by 1.1 million, reflecting performance-based RSUs granted during the nine-month period. 
 Impairment of Content Assets 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no impairment charges were recorded related to our content assets. In comparison, we incurred an impairment charge of 19.0 million for the same periods in 2023. For a more detailed discussion of the 2023 impairment charge and the underlying factors contributing to it, refer to Note 4 - Balance Sheet Components in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 The fair value of our warrant liability is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account a number of economic assumptions, including the market price of our Common Stock and its expected volatility. Changes in these inputs from period to period may significantly affect changes in fair values. 
 Interest and Other Income 
 Interest and other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.5 million and 1.7 million, respectively, compared to a de minimis amount and 0.9 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to the absence of certain non-recurring items recorded in 2023. 
 Equity Method Investment Loss 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of 0.3 million compared to a loss of 2.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss of 2.2 million compared to a loss of 5.1 million for the same period in 2023 related to its investments in the Spiegel Venture and Nebula. The decrease in losses is primarily due to the 2.0 million impairment charge recorded by the Company to its investment in Spiegel Venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 0.1 million. For the comparative periods in 2023, the provision for income taxes was 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively, primarily due to losses generated before income taxes. Our provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company being in a full valuation allowance position and not recognizing a tax benefit attributable to generated losses for either federal or state income tax purposes.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 9.7 million , with an additional 30.1 million million held in investments in debt securities that can be readily converted to cash to support ongoing operating cash flow needs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 10.1 million, primarily due to non-cash expenses, while generating 5.1 million of net cash from operating activities. Additionally, the Company used 30.1 million in net cash for investing activities, entirely related to purchases of debt securities and 3.7 million of net cash for financing activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments and short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions. We regularly monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and money market fund asset managers with whom we invest our funds, and we maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in both the short term and long term. 
 We believe that our current cash levels, including investments that are readily convertible to cash, will be adequate to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments and working capital for at least the next twelve months. We believe that we have access to additional funds in the short term and the long term, if needed, through the capital markets to obtain further financing. 
 We use cash principally to acquire content, promote our service through advertising and marketing, and provide for working capital to operate our business. We have experienced significant net losses since our inception, and while we are cash flow positive, we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses due to the investments needed to support our business plan. 
 As previously discussed, we began entering into trade and barter transactions in the second quarter of 2023 primarily for the purpose of exchanging content assets through licensing agreements with media counterparties. Our use of these transactions has enabled us to acquire quality content that we can monetize through various distribution channels while preserving our liquidity. 
 The following table provides details of the dividends declared and paid as of September 30, 2024. 
 Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Per Share Aggregate Amount March 13, 2024 April 12, 2024 April 30, 2024 0.025 1.3 million May 6, 2024 July 12, 2024 July 31, 2024 0.025 1.3 million August 12, 2024 October 12, 2024 October 31, 2024 0.025 1.4 million 
 Our Board of Directors has declared the next cash dividend of 0.025 per share to be paid on March 28, 2025, for an expected aggregate amount of 1.3 million. Subject to future declaration by our Board of Directors, we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends. 
 On June 10, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to 4 million of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 218 thousand of Common Stock under this program. 
 We cannot predict when or if we will repurchase any additional shares of common stock as this stock repurchase program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints imposed by applicable federal securities laws, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. The program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash inflow from operating activities was 5.1 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in operating cash outflow of 18.7 million. 
 Although we reported a net loss of 10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this amount reflected noncash items such as amortization of content assets, stock-based compensation and equity method investment loss of 14.5 million, 4.7 million, and 2.2 million, respectively. Cash used during the quarter included a 3.4 million change in operating assets and liabilities and additions to content assets and change of content liabilities of 3.4 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported a net loss of 44.2 million.

 31 

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net cash outflow used in investing activities of 30 million. The net cash outflow used in investing activities was solely due to purchases of investments in debt securities. In contrast, for the same period in 2023, our cash inflows were primarily due to maturities of investments in debt securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 3.7 million and 0.1 million, respectively, an increase of 3.6 million primarily due to dividends paid and tax withholding. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Going forward, we expect to continue making expenditures for additions to our content assets and purchases of property and equipment, although at a slower rate than in previous periods. The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within management s control. Depending on market conditions, we may choose to defer a portion of our budgeted expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate cash flow. Subject to financing alternatives, we may also increase our capital expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive. 
 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain amounts included in or affecting the financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the accounting policies set forth below comprise the most important critical accounting policies for the Company. A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management evaluates such policies on an ongoing basis, based upon historical results and experience, consultation with experts and other methods that management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances under which the judgments and estimates are made, as well as management s forecasts as to the manner in which such circumstances may change in the future. 
 
 For more detailed information on our critical accounting policies, including those related to content assets, revenue recognition and trade and barter transactions, refer to the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2024. This comprehensive discussion helps to ensure that stakeholders have a complete understanding of the accounting methodologies and principles that influence the financial statements presented herein.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Our management is required to evaluate, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, any changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during each fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
