 reportable segments, Construction and Materials. Previously, leaders within our former operating groups of California, Central and Mountain managed both Construction and Materials operations within each group. This change allows us to better leverage our expertise within each reportable segment with leadership having direct oversight of their respective segment operations. As a result of the reorganization, we will no longer disclose financial information by operating group. There were no material impacts to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and no changes to our reportable segments. 
 Due to the changes in our operational structure and the resulting changes to reporting units, we performed quantitative goodwill impairment tests, immediately before and after the reorganization, on the affected reporting units. These reporting units previously aligned with our operating group structure, but have now been combined into two reporting units, Construction and Materials. The reporting units associated with the acquisition of Lehman-Roberts Company and Memphis Stone Gravel Company (collectively, "LRC/MSG") were not impacted by the reorganization. For each of the affected reporting units, we calculated the estimated fair value consistent with the annual impairment assessment using the discounted cash flows and market multiple methods. These tests indicated that the estimated fair values of the affected reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts with headroom in excess of . 
 Share Repurchase Program: As announced on February 3, 2022, on February 1, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock at management s discretion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 225,000 shares under this authorization. The share repurchases are included in Repurchases of common stock on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and within Financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2024, 218.2 million of the authorization remained available. 
 Seasonality: Our operations are typically affected more by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues and profitability. Therefore, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

 million, subject to customary closing adjustments, plus an estimated amount related to tax make-whole agreements with the seller. We purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in LRC/MSG and the purchase price was funded by a million senior secured term loan, a draw of million under our existing revolver and the remainder from cash on hand. Both the senior secured term loan and the draw under the revolver were fully repaid during the first half of 2024. 
 The acquired businesses are longstanding asphalt paving and asphalt and aggregates producers and suppliers. LRC/MSG operates strategically located asphalt plants and sand and gravel mines serving the greater Memphis area and northern Mississippi.

 million and million, respectively. Gross profit attributable to LRC/MSG for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively. 
 Purchase Price Allocation 
 In accordance with ASC 805, the total purchase price and assumed liabilities were allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, as presented in the table below. 
 We recorded a 22.0 million provisional estimate related to tax make-whole agreements with the seller at the time of the acquisition. In the second quarter of 2024, the former owners of LRC/MSG determined their personal tax burden related to the sale of the businesses which allowed us to finalize our tax make-whole obligation. Our obligation was 7.1 million, which was paid in June 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. These adjustments included a million net increase from net working capital adjustments and a 2.2 million net decrease in the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, offset by a 14.9 million decrease in the estimated obligation associated with the tax make-whole agreements noted above. The impact of these adjustments was a decrease in goodwill of 8.1 million. We paid million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 associated with the acquisition of LRC/MSG, which includes 6.1 million for working capital adjustments and 7.1 million for the tax make-whole obligation. 
 There were no material measurement period adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have finalized the purchase price accounting.

 reportable segments, Construction and Materials. Previously, leaders within our former operating groups of California, Central and Mountain managed both Construction and Materials operations within each group. As a result of the reorganization, we will no longer disclose financial information by operating group and we have updated our presentation of disaggregated revenue. The prior year disaggregation of revenue amounts have been recast to conform with the current period presentation. 
 Revenue is disaggregated by reportable segment (see Note 18) and customer type, which we believe best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 
 Customer Type 
 Customers in our Construction segment are predominantly in the public sector which includes certain federal agencies, state departments of transportation, local transit authorities, county and city public works departments and school districts. Our private sector customers include, but are not limited to, developers, utilities and private owners of industrial, commercial and residential sites. Customers of our Materials segment include internal usage by our own construction projects, as well as third-party customers. Based on the nature of the Materials business, it is not meaningful to disaggregate revenue by customer type.

The changes in contract transaction price for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were from items such as executed or estimated change orders and unresolved contract modifications and claims. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate claim recovery estimates included in contract asset and liability balances were million and million, respectively.

No other contract retention receivable individually exceeded 10 of total contract assets at any of the presented dates. The majority of the contract retention balance is expected to be collected within one year. 
 As work is performed, revenue is recognized and the corresponding contract liabilities are reduced. We recognized revenue of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Credit Agreement 
 In June 2022, we entered into the Credit Agreement which matures on June 2, 2027. The Credit Agreement consisted of a million senior secured, revolving credit facility (the Revolver ), including an accordion feature allowing us to increase borrowings up to the greater of (a) million and (b) of twelve-month trailing consolidated EBITDA, subject to lender approval. The Credit Agreement includes a million sublimit for letters of credit

 million sublimit for swingline loans. In May 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 1"). Amendment No. 1 amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit us to exchange our Convertible Notes for cash and shares of our common stock and to clarify that (i) the issuance of the Convertible Notes was permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement and (ii) that a Swap Contract (as defined in the Credit Agreement) does not include any Permitted Call Spread Transaction (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 In November 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 2") which amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, provide for a million senior secured term loan (the Term Loan ), which was fully drawn on closing to fund the LRC/MSG acquisition. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature on June 2, 2027 and amortize per year, payable in quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. The Term Loan was fully repaid with the net proceeds from our Convertible Notes in the second quarter of 2024. 
 We may borrow on the Revolver, at our option, at either (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR term rate plus a credit adjustment spread plus applicable margin ranging from to , or (b) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to . The applicable margin is based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in our Credit Agreement), calculated quarterly. As of September 30, 2024, the total unused availability under the Credit Agreement was million, resulting from million in issued and outstanding letters of credit and drawn under the Revolver. The letters of credit had expiration dates between November 2024 and December 2027. 
 3.25 Convertible Notes 
 On June 11, 2024, we issued 373.8 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2024. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2029, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. Thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. 
 The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 12.8398 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 77.88 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment if certain events occur. Upon conversion, we will settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash, and any conversion premium in excess of the principal amount in cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
 In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. If certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change as set forth in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such event or notice of redemption. 
 We will not be able to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to June 21, 2027. On or after June 21, 2027, we will be able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of Granite s common stock is equal to or greater than 130 of the conversion price for a specified period of time at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes contains customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, with respect to us or our significant subsidiaries, all outstanding Convertible Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding may declare the Convertible Notes due and payable immediately. 
 The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately 365.0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discount. We used approximately 46.0 million of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering to pay the cost of entering into capped call transactions in connection with the Convertible Notes. In addition, we paid approximately 57.6 million of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering to

 (Unaudited) 

 Convertible Notes (the "2024 capped call transactions"). The 2024 capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the 2024 capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of 119.82 of the 2024 capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the 2024 capped call transactions. 
 Convertible Notes 
 On May 11, 2023, we issued million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2023 and mature on May 15, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2027, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. Thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
 The initial conversion rate applicable to the Convertible Notes is 21.6807 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment if certain events occur. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. If certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change as set forth in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such event or notice of redemption. 
 We will not be able to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to May 20, 2026. On or after May 20, 2026, we have the option to redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes if the last reported sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than of the conversion price for a specified period of time at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes contains customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, with respect to us or our significant subsidiaries, all outstanding Convertible Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding may declare the Convertible Notes due and payable immediately. 
 The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately million, after deducting the initial purchasers discount. We used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the 2023 capped call transactions (as described below). In addition, we used approximately million of the net proceeds and issued shares of Granite common stock in exchange for approximately million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes concurrent with the offering in separate and individually negotiated transactions (the "Exchange Transaction"). In connection with the Exchange Transaction, we entered into partial unwind agreements (the "Unwind Agreements") with certain financial institutions to unwind a portion of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the Unwind Agreements, we received shares of our common stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares) in 
 22 

Table of Contents

 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED 
 (Unaudited) 

 Convertible Notes that were exchanged in the Exchange Transaction described above and paid million in cash in respect of the unwind of the portion of the existing warrant transactions that correspond to the Convertible Notes that were exchanged in the Exchange Transaction described above. 
 2023 Capped Call Transactions 
 In May 2023, we entered into capped call transactions (the "2023 capped call transactions") in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes. The 2023 capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the 2023 capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of 79.83 of the 2023 capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the 2023 capped call transactions. 
 Convertible Notes 
 The Convertible Notes were issued in November 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of million, with an interest rate of and a maturity date of November 1, 2024, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
 In June 2024, we called the Convertible Notes for redemption. As of September 30, 2024, no 2.75 Convertible Notes remained outstanding. 
 Covenants and Events of Default 
 Our Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various affirmative, restrictive and financial covenants, including the financial covenants described below. Our failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Convertible Notes and Convertible Notes are governed by the terms and conditions of their respective indentures. Our failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due or within the relevant grace period on our Convertible Notes, our Convertible Notes or our Credit Agreement would constitute an event of default under the Convertible Notes indenture, the Convertible Notes indenture or the Credit Agreement. A default under our Credit Agreement could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under such facility; (ii) termination of such facility; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under such facility be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of amounts owed under the Credit Agreement; and/or (v) foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under such facility. A default under the Convertible Notes indenture or the Convertible Notes indenture could result in acceleration of the maturity of the notes. 
 The most significant financial covenants under the terms of our Credit Agreement require the maintenance of a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. We are not aware of any non-compliance by any of our unconsolidated real estate entities with the covenants contained in their debt agreements. 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million and million, respectively, of amortization related to debt issuance costs. We also capitalized 10.3 million in third party offering costs related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes. These debt issuance costs will be amortized over the expected life of the Convertible Notes. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 0.6 million and 3.0 million, respectively, of amortization related to debt issuance costs. This included 1.7 million of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes that were repaid and are included in the loss on debt extinguishment. We also capitalized 10.0 million in third party offering costs related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes. These debt issuance costs will be amortized over the expected life of the Convertible Notes.

 (1) The dilutive effect of the convertible notes was determined using the if-converted method. As the Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, the Convertible Notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, and the resulting shares are included in the denominator of the calculation. In addition, interest charges, net of any income tax effects are added back to the numerator of the calculation. For the Convertible Notes, we are required to settle the principal amount in cash and any conversion premium in excess of the principal amount in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. As such, the Convertible Notes only have an impact on diluted earnings per share when the average share price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense related to convertible notes of 6.9 million and the potential dilution from the convertible notes converting into 9.1 million shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
 In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes and Convertible Notes, we entered into the 2024 capped call transactions and 2023 capped call transactions, respectively, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

 Effective tax rate 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is lower than the prior year due to tax expense recognized in the third quarter of 2023 associated with recording a non-deductible goodwill impairment and valuation allowances on certain foreign net operating losses. Our effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is lower than the prior year primarily due to incurring less nondeductible debt extinguishment costs in 2024 than 2023 as well as the tax expense associated with the goodwill impairment and valuation allowances recorded in the third quarter of 2023.

 It is possible that future developments in our legal proceedings and inquiries could require us to (i) adjust or reverse existing accruals, or (ii) record new accruals that we did not originally believe to be probable or that could not be reasonably estimated. Such changes could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows in any particular reporting period. 
 Ordinary Course Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we and our affiliates are involved in various legal proceedings alleging, among other things, liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with the performance of services and/or materials provided, the various outcomes of which often cannot be predicted with certainty. For information on our accounting policies regarding affirmative claims and back charges that we are party to in the ordinary course of business, see Note 1 of our Annual Report. We and our affiliates are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcomes which often cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 Some of the matters in which we or our joint ventures and affiliates are involved may involve compensatory, punitive, or other claims or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not probable to be incurred or cannot currently be reasonably estimated. In addition, in some circumstances our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended, debarred or incur other administrative penalties or sanctions, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. While any of our pending legal proceedings may be subject to early resolution as a result of our ongoing efforts to resolve the proceedings, whether or when any legal proceeding will be resolved is neither predictable nor guaranteed.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "Annual Report") and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included herein. 
 
 Forward-Looking Disclosure 
 From time to time, Granite makes certain comments and disclosures in reports and statements, including in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or statements made by its officers or directors, that are not based on historical facts, including statements regarding future events, occurrences, circumstances, strategy, activities, performance, outlook, outcomes, guidance, capital expenditures, committed and awarded projects, results and strategic actions, that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are identified by words such as future, outlook, assumes, believes, expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, plans, appears, may, will, should, could, would, continue, and the negatives thereof or other comparable terminology or by the context in which they are made. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of Granite. These forward-looking statements are estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and reflect our current expectations regarding future events, occurrences, circumstances, strategy, activities, performance, outlook, outcomes, guidance, capital expenditures, committed and awarded projects, results, and strategic actions. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based on beliefs, assumptions or estimates that may prove to be incorrect. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those more specifically described in our Annual Report under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. The reader is also cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason . 
 
 Overview 
 We deliver infrastructure solutions for public and private clients primarily in the United States. We are one of the largest diversified construction and construction materials companies in the United States. Within the public sector, we primarily concentrate on infrastructure projects, including the construction of streets, roads, highways, mass transit facilities, airport infrastructure, bridges, dams, power-related facilities, utilities, tunnels, water well drilling and other infrastructure-related projects. Within the private sector, we perform various services such as site preparation, mining services and infrastructure services for commercial and industrial sites, railways, residential development, energy development, as well as provide construction management professional services. 
 The five primary economic drivers of our business are (i) the overall health of the U.S. economy including access to resources (labor, supplies and subcontractors); (ii) federal, state and local public funding levels; (iii) population growth resulting in public and private development; (iv) the need to build, replace or repair aging infrastructure; and (v) the pricing of certain commodity related products. Changes in these drivers can either reduce our revenues and/or gross profit margins or provide opportunities for revenue growth and gross profit margin improvement. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we reorganized our operational structure to more closely align with our two reportable segments, Construction and Materials. Previously, leaders within our three former operating groups of California, Central and Mountain managed both Construction and Materials operations within each group. This change allows us to better leverage our expertise within each reportable segment with leadership having direct oversight of their respective segment operations. As a result of the reorganization, we will no longer disclose financial information by operating group. There were no material impacts to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and no changes to our reportable segments. 
 
 Current Economic Environment and Outlook 
 Funding for our public work projects, which account for approximately 80 of our portfolio, is dependent on federal, state, regional and local revenues. At the federal level, the continued rollout of the 1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act IIJA has increased federal highway, bridge and transit funding to its highest level in more than six decades with 550 billion in incremental funding over five years. The increased multi-year spending commitment has improved the programming visibility for state and local governments and has driven an increase in project lettings starting in 2023 that is continuing in 2024 and we believe will carry into 2025 and beyond. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 At state, regional and local levels, voter-approved state and local transportation measures continue to support infrastructure spending. While each market is unique, we see a strong funding environment at the state and local levels aided by the IIJA. In California, our top revenue-generating state, despite overall budgetary concerns, a significant part of the state infrastructure spend is funded through Senate Bill 1 (SB-1), the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, a 10-year, 54.2 billion program, which may only be used for transportation-related purposes, without any sunset provisions. 
 Over the recent years, inflation, supply chain and labor constraints have had a significant impact on the global economy including the construction industry in the United States. While it is impossible to fully eliminate the impact of these factors, we have applied proactive measures such as fixed forward purchase contracts of oil related inputs, energy surcharges, and adjustment of project schedules for constraints related to construction materials such as concrete. While we actively work to mitigate the impacts of oil price inflation, further price increases may adversely impact us in the future. 
 Our Committed and Awarded Projects CAP balance continues to be strong at 5.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Our CAP is supported by a positive public funding environment and resilient private market which we believe will provide further opportunities for continued CAP growth. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 On August 9, 2024, we acquired Dickerson Bowen, Inc. ("D B"). D B is an aggregates, asphalt, and highway construction company serving central and southern Mississippi. 
 On November 30, 2023, we acquired Lehman-Roberts Company and Memphis Stone Gravel Company (collectively, "LRC/MSG"). LRC/MSG operates strategically located asphalt plants and sand and gravel mines serving the greater Memphis area and northern Mississippi. 
 On April 24, 2023, we acquired Coast Mountain Resources (2020) Ltd. which changed its name to Granite Infrastructure Canada, Ltd. ("Granite Canada") on May 13, 2024. Granite Canada is a construction aggregate producer based in British Columbia, Canada operating on Malahat First Nation land. 
 The results of operations of these businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition, which impacts comparability to the applicable prior periods. 
 See Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Our operations are typically affected more by inclement weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues and profitability. Therefore, the results of operations of a given quarter are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
 The following table presents a financial summary for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Construction revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 135.0 million and 395.3 million, or 14.3 and 18.0 , respectively, when compared to 2023, primarily due to higher levels of CAP, more favorable weather conditions early in 2024 and revenue from acquired businesses. Our acquired businesses contributed 41.5 million and 77.1 million of construction revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Materials Revenue 
 Materials revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 23.7 million and 59.5 million, or 13.8 and 15.8 , respectively, when compared to 2023. These increases were primarily driven by increases in revenue from newly acquired businesses of 20.8 million and 46.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in addition to higher asphalt and aggregate sales prices which offset decreased asphalt volumes. 
 Committed and Awarded Projects 
 CAP consists of two components: (1) unearned revenue and (2) other awards. Unearned revenue includes the revenue we expect to record in the future on executed contracts, including 100 of our consolidated joint venture contracts and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. We generally include a project in unearned revenue at the time a contract is awarded, the contract has been executed and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Contract options and task orders are included in unearned revenue when exercised or issued, respectively. Certain government contracts where funding is appropriated on a periodic basis are included in unearned revenue at the time of the award when it is probable the contract value will be funded and executed. 
 Other awards include the general construction portion of construction management/general contractor CM/GC contracts and awarded contracts with unexercised contract options or unissued task orders. The general construction portion of CM/GC contracts are included in other awards to the extent contract execution and funding is probable. Contracts with unexercised contract options or unissued task orders are included in other awards to the extent option exercise or task order issuance is probable.

 Gross Profit 
 The following table presents gross profit by reportable segment for the respective periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Construction 170,685 137,162 362,885 253,021 Percent of segment revenue 15.8 14.5 14.0 11.5 Materials 32,264 29,481 59,060 49,067 Percent of segment revenue 16.6 17.2 13.5 13.0 Total gross profit 202,949 166,643 421,945 302,088 Percent of total revenue 15.9 14.9 13.9 11.7 
 Construction gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 33.5 million and 109.9 million, or 24.4 and 43.4 , respectively, when compared to 2023 primarily due to higher revenue and less negative net impacts from revisions in estimates in the current period. For further discussion of projects with revisions in estimates which individually had an impact of 5.0 million or more on gross profit, see Note 4 of "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements." Acquired businesses recognized gross profit of 8.7 million and 7.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which include 2.3 million and 6.3 million, respectively, of purchase accounting related depreciation and intangible asset amortization. See Note 3 of "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information about acquisitions. 
 Materials gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.8 million and 10.0 million, respectively, when compared to 2023. The increased gross profit was primarily due to the inclusion of the results of acquired businesses and higher sales prices. Acquired businesses recognized gross profit of 0.4 million and 1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which include 0.4 million and 3.4 million, respectively, of purchase accounting related depreciation and intangible asset amortization.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 The following table presents the components of selling, general and administrative expenses for the respective periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Selling: Salaries and related expenses 16,515 13,939 47,339 44,195 Incentive compensation 4,738 1,816 5,366 2,327 Stock-based compensation 241 231 1,055 1,303 Other selling expenses 960 1,430 4,181 4,155 Total selling 22,454 17,416 57,941 51,980 General and administrative: Salaries and related expenses 25,565 22,890 80,771 74,715 Incentive compensation 16,757 12,164 19,532 13,727 Stock-based compensation 1,583 1,136 14,873 7,104 Other general and administrative expenses 25,290 21,188 76,577 64,953 Total general and administrative 69,196 57,378 191,754 160,499 Total selling, general and administrative 91,650 74,794 249,695 212,479 Percent of revenue 7.2 6.7 8.2 8.3 
 Selling Expenses 
 Selling expenses include the costs for estimating and bidding including offsetting customer reimbursements for portions of our selling/bid submission expenses (i.e., stipends), business development and materials facility permits. Selling expenses can vary depending on the volume of projects in process and the number of employees assigned to estimating and bidding activities. As projects are completed or the volume of work slows down, we temporarily redeploy project employees to bid on new projects, moving their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to selling expenses. Selling expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 5.0 million and 6.0 million, or 28.9 and 11.5 when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in incentive compensation due to improved financial performance as well as higher salaries and related expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate functions. Other general and administrative expenses include travel and entertainment, outside services, information technology, depreciation, occupancy, training, office supplies, incentive compensation, changes in the fair market value of our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation plan liability and other miscellaneous expenses. Total general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11.8 million, or 20.6 , when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation due to improved financial performance as well as 4.3 million of general and administrative expenses from acquired businesses, including 2.4 million of purchase accounting related depreciation and intangible asset amortization. Total general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 31.3 million, or 19.5 , when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 11.9 million of general and administrative expenses from acquired businesses, including 4.5 million of purchase accounting related depreciation and intangible asset amortization, as well as a 7.8 million increase in stock-based compensation and a 5.8 million increase in incentive compensation, both due to improved financial performance. 
 Other Costs, net 
 The following table presents other costs, net for the respective periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other costs, net 8,543 19,843 29,778 37,973 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other costs, net decreased 11.3 million and 8.2 million, respectively, compared to prior year. The decreases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to 8.0 million and 20.0 million, respectively, of litigation charges in the prior year that did not recur in the current year combined with 5.0 million of non-cash impairment charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Those decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs in the current year associated with the defense of a former Company officer in his ongoing civil litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment (272) 27,552 51,052 Interest income (7,513) (4,293) (17,815) (11,287) Interest expense 7,905 4,877 21,325 11,899 Equity in income of affiliates, net (4,394) (7,147) (12,921) (19,378) Other (income) expense, net (874) 462 (1,350) (2,713) Total other (income) expense, net (5,148) (6,101) 16,791 29,573 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total other income, net, decreased 1.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total other expense, net, decreased 12.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 30.2 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.75 Convertible Notes and incurred a 27.6 million loss on debt extinguishment which was 23.5 million less than the 2023 extinguishment charge. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat when compared to 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense, net of interest income, increased 2.9 million, as a result of increased borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income due to higher cash balances. Equity in income of affiliates, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.8 million and 6.5 million, respectively, primarily due to lower sales by our affiliates. 
 Income Taxes 
 The following table presents the provision for income taxes for the respective periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes 25,469 22,423 36,636 21,978 Effective tax rate 23.3 28.1 28.2 73.6 
 We calculate our income tax provision at the end of each interim period by estimating our annual effective tax rate, applying that rate to our income or loss before tax and adjusting for discrete items not included in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate. The effect of changes in enacted tax laws, tax rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. See Note 16 of "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information. 
 Amount Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 The following table presents the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for the respective periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount attributable to non-controlling interests (5,026) 128 (8,529) 9,723 
 The amount attributable to non-controlling interests represents the non-controlling owners share of the net (income) or loss of our consolidated construction joint ventures. The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 increased 5.2 million and 18.3 million, respectively, compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of revisions in estimates in the current year on one consolidated construction joint venture (see Note 4 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ). 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, investments, available borrowing capacity under our credit facility and cash generated from operations. We may also from time-to-time issue and sell equity, debt or hybrid securities or engage in other capital markets transactions or sell one or more business units or assets. See Note 14 of the "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for information on our Credit Agreement, our 3.75 Convertible Notes and our 3.25 Convertible Notes. 
 Our material cash requirements include paying the costs and expenses associated with our operations, servicing outstanding indebtedness, making capital expenditures and paying dividends on our capital stock. We may also from time to time prepay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness, repurchase shares of our common stock or acquire assets or businesses that are complementary to our operations. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for information on our share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and our acquisitions. 
 We believe our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs, capital expenditures, financial commitments, cash dividend payments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for the next twelve months. We also believe our primary sources of liquidity, access to debt and equity capital markets and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term requirements and plans. However, there can be no assurance that sufficient capital will continue to be available or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of deposits and money market funds held with established national financial institutions and marketable securities consisting primarily of U.S. Government and agency obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total unused availability under our Credit Agreement was 333.5 million, resulting from 16.5 million in issued and outstanding letters of credit and nothing drawn under the Revolver. See Note 14 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 29.2 million of contract retention receivables from Brightline Trains Florida LLC ("Brightline") which represented of total contract assets (see Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ). As of the date of this report, 24.2 million is past due. Once all conditions of final completion are satisfied, the remaining 5.0 million will be due to us within 40 days. Brightline has experienced delays in securing additional funding in the past, therefore the timing and probability of future payments may be affected, and our liquidity impacted if Brightline faces future funding difficulties. 
 In evaluating our liquidity position and needs, we also consider cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated construction joint ventures CCJVs ). The following table presents our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including amounts from our CCJVs, as of the respective dates: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents excluding CCJVs 313,218 297,439 CCJV cash and cash equivalents (1) 149,068 120,224 Total consolidated cash and cash equivalents 462,286 417,663 Short-term marketable securities (2) 10,147 35,863 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 472,433 453,526 
 (1) The volume and stage of completion of contracts from our CCJVs may cause fluctuations in joint venture cash and cash equivalents between periods. The assets of each consolidated and unconsolidated construction joint venture relate solely to that joint venture. The decision to distribute joint venture assets must generally be made jointly by a majority of the members and, accordingly, these assets, including those associated with estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims and back charge claims, are generally not available for the working capital needs of Granite until distributed. 
 (2) All marketable securities were classified as held-to-maturity and consisted of U.S. Government and agency obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Granite s portion of CCJV cash and cash equivalents was 91.1 million and 73.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Excluded from the table above is 26.2 million and 34.2 million as of September 30,

Table of Contents 

 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of Granite s portion of unconsolidated construction joint venture cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Major capital expenditures are typically for aggregate and asphalt production facilities, aggregate reserves, construction equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements and investments in our information technology systems. The timing and amount of such expenditures can vary based on the progress of planned capital projects, the type and size of construction projects, changes in business outlook and other factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had capital expenditures of 108.2 million, compared to 109.0 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We currently anticipate 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately 130 million, including approximately 40 million in planned strategic materials investments in land, reserves and an aggregate plant. This also includes approximately 20 million related to a project-specific tunnel boring machine. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 283,549 34,198 Investing activities (211,107) (89,270) Financing activities (27,819) 53,205 
 Operating activities 
 As a large infrastructure contractor and construction materials producer, our revenue, gross profit and the resulting operating cash flows can differ significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors, including project progression toward completion, outstanding contract change orders and affirmative claims, and the payment terms of our contracts. Additionally, operating cash flows are impacted by the timing related to funding construction joint ventures and the resolution of uncertainties inherent in the complex nature of the work that we perform, including claim and back charge settlements. Our working capital assets result from both public and private sector projects. Customers in the private sector can be slower paying than those in the public sector; however, private sector projects generally have higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue. While we typically invoice our customers on a monthly basis, our construction contracts frequently provide for retention that is a specified percentage withheld from each payment by our customers until the contract is completed and the work accepted by the customer. 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 283.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents a 249.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities when compared to the same period of 2023. The change was primarily attributable to a 107.1 million increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items and a 107.2 million increase in cash provided by working capital, which includes receivables, net contract assets, inventories, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities. Additionally, distributions from, net of contributions to, unconsolidated construction joint ventures and affiliates increased 35.0 million when compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities of 211.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents a 121.8 million increase in cash used in investing activities when compared to the same period of 2023. The change was primarily due to a 108.7 million increase in cash used related to business acquisitions (see Note 3 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ). 
 Financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities of 27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents an 81.0 million increase in cash used in financing activities when compared to the same period of 2023. The change was primarily due to a 40.7 million increase in debt repayments and related charges, net of proceeds from debt issuances. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The year over year increase in cash used in financing activities was also due to a 17.5 million increase in repurchases of common stock as well as a decrease in contributions from non-controlling partners, net of distributions, of 23.9 million. 
 
 Derivatives 
 We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value using Level 2 inputs. See Note 9 to Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Surety Bonds and Real Estate Mortgages 
 We are generally required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts. At September 30, 2024, approximately 3.5 billion of our 5.6 billion CAP was bonded. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are generally released from the bonds when the obligations of the underlying contract have been fulfilled. The ability to maintain bonding capacity requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties. 
 Our investments in real estate affiliates are subject to mortgage indebtedness. This indebtedness is non-recourse to Granite but is recourse to the real estate entities. The terms of this indebtedness are typically renegotiated to reflect the evolving nature of the real estate projects as they progress through acquisition, entitlement and development. Modification of these terms may include changes in loan-to-value ratios requiring the real estate entity to repay portions of the debt. Our unconsolidated investments in our foreign affiliates are subject to local bank debt primarily for equipment purchases and working capital. This debt is non-recourse to Granite, but it is recourse to the affiliates. The debt associated with our unconsolidated non-construction entities is included in Note 10 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Covenants and Events of Default 
 Our Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various affirmative, restrictive and financial covenants, including the financial covenants described below. Our failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the 3.25 Convertible Notes and 3.75 Convertible Notes are governed by the terms and conditions of their respective indentures. Our failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due or within the relevant grace period on our 3.25 Convertible Notes, our 3.75 Convertible Notes or our Credit Agreement would constitute an event of default under the 3.25 Convertible Notes indenture, the 3.75 Convertible Note indenture or the Credit Agreement. A default under our Credit Agreement could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under such facility; (ii) termination of such facility; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under such facility be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of amounts owed under the Credit Agreement; and/or (v) foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under such facility. A default under the 3.25 Convertible Notes indenture or the 3.75 Convertible Notes indenture could result in acceleration of the maturity of the notes. 
 The most significant financial covenants under the terms of our Credit Agreement require the maintenance of a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 As announced on February 3, 2022, on February 1, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock at management s discretion (the 2022 authorization ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 225,000 shares under the 2022 authorization and 218.2 million remained available under the 2022 authorization as of September 30, 2024. 
 The specific timing and amount of any future repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors.
