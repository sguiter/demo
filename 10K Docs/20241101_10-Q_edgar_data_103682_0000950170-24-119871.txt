Effective tax rate 

The IRA created a nuclear production tax credit for electricity produced and sold beginning in 2024. The amount of the credit to be realized, if any, is a function of annual qualified production levels and gross receipts determined for each of the Companies nuclear units that cannot be fully determined until the completion of the calendar year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Virginia Power recorded a million tax benefit which represents a prorated portion of the estimated net realizable value of the nuclear production tax credit. The ultimate nuclear production tax credit realized by the Companies could vary significantly based on actual market prices, qualifying production and/or final computational U.S. Treasury guidance. Dominion Energy s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes a net income tax expense of million associated with the remeasurement of consolidated state deferred taxes as a result of the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions and the sale of Dominion Energy's noncontrolling partnership interest in Cove Point. See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these transactions. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Companies unrecognized tax benefits or possible changes that could reasonably be expected to occur during the next twelve months. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits. Discontinued operations Income tax expense reflected in discontinued operations is million and billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Dominion Energy entered into agreements for the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions in September 2023, each of which was treated as a stock sale for income tax purposes. During 2023 in connection with the pending sales, Dominion Energy recorded a charge of million to establish deferred tax liabilities to reflect the excess of financial reporting basis over tax basis in stock of the entities to be sold. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of these transactions. Dominion Energy recorded a tax benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including the reversal of million of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions previously established during 2023 and 2024.

on its generation and distribution services for the test period, within 70 basis points of its authorized ROE of established in the 2021 Triennial Review. Virginia Power did not request an increase in base rates for generation and distribution services and proposed that base rates remain at their existing level utilizing an ROE of for the prospective test periods and a common equity capitalization to total capitalization ratio of . Virginia Power noted that while its prospective test periods would result in a revenue deficiency, it did not request an increase to base rates given that the combination of certain riders with an aggregate annual revenue requirement of at least million into base rates effective July 2023 cannot serve as the basis for an increase in base rates as part of the 2023 Biennial Review. In November 2023, Virginia Power, the Virginia Commission staff and other parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Virginia Commission for approval. The comprehensive settlement agreement indicates that Virginia Power demonstrated it earned a combined ROE of on its generation and distribution services for the test period, requires previously unrecovered severe weather event costs of million to be recovered through base rates during the 2023-2024 biennial period, with carrying costs, and provides for million in one-time credits to customers by September 2024. In February 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the comprehensive settlement agreement and issued its order in this matter. In doing so, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Power s earnings for the test period, considered as a whole, were within basis points above or below its authorized ROE of . The Virginia Commission also authorized an ROE of , as directed by legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, for Virginia Power that will be applied to Virginia Power s riders prospectively and that will also be utilized to measure base rate earnings for the 2025 Biennial Review. In connection with the order, Virginia Power recorded a net benefit of million million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2024 within impairment of assets and other charges in its Consolidated Statements of Income for a regulatory asset for previously unrecovered severe weather event costs, which will be amortized by the end of 2024. Virginia Fuel Expenses In May 2023, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor filing with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expense for the rate year beginning July 1, 2023 and a projected billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023. As discussed in Note 13 to the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Virginia Power proposed two alternatives to recover these under-collected fuel costs, including an option based on an anticipated securitization of up to billion under-recovered balance as of June 30, 2023 as permitted under legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, with such securitization approved by the Virginia Commission in November 2023 and completed by Virginia Power in February 2024. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power s annual fuel factor based on the securitization option, which results in a net decrease in Virginia Power s fuel revenues for the rate year of approximately million. In addition, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power s proposal to alter the order in which revenue from certain customers who elect to pay market-based rates would be allocated between base rates and fuel, which results in a reduction to fuel revenue of million. In May 2024, Virginia Power filed its annual fuel factor with the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning July 1, 2024 and to return an estimated million net over-recovered balance through June 30, 2024. Virginia Power s proposed fuel rate represents a fuel revenue decrease of million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the rate year beginning July 1, 2024. In May 2024, the Virginia Commission ordered 

 47 

million of capacity expenses expected to be incurred with PJM for 2025 for jurisdictional customers and have such expenses considered as part of the 2027 Biennial Review. This matter is pending. Renewable Generation Projects In October 2023, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate utility-scale projects totaling approximately MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2023, are expected to cost approximately million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2024 and 2026. In March 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the petition. In October 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission for CPCNs to construct or acquire and operate two utility-scale projects totaling approximately MW of solar generation as part of its efforts to meet the renewable generation development targets under the VCEA. The projects, as of October 2024, are expected to cost approximately million in the aggregate, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service between 2026 and 2028. This matter is pending. Virginia LNG Storage Facility In June 2024, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission to amend the CPCNs for Brunswick County and Greensville County to construct and operate an LNG production, storage and regasification facility and related transmission facilities adjacent to Greensville County. When complete, the facility will store the liquefied equivalent of approximately bcf and would be able to regasify approximately of its storage capacity per day and liquefy from the pipeline less than of its equivalent storage capacity per day. The facility will serve as a backup fuel source for Brunswick County and Greensville County to support operations and improve system reliability. The facility is expected to cost approximately million, excluding financing costs, and be placed into service by the end of 2027. This matter is pending. Riders Other than the following matters, there have been no significant developments regarding the significant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Repurchase of Common Stock In November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of Dominion Energy s common stock, with billion available as of September 30, 2024. Dominion Energy did t repurchase any shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which do not count against its stock repurchase authorization. 

Environmental Matters The Companies are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. Air The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to meet applicable requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to the CAA s permitting and other requirements. Ozone Standards The EPA published final non-attainment designations for the October 2015 ozone standards in June 2018 with states required to develop plans to address the new standard. Certain states in which the Companies operate have developed plans, and had such plans approved or partially approved by the EPA, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Companies results of operations

tons per year of CO 2 equivalent emissions. Until the EPA ultimately takes final action on this rulemaking, the Companies cannot predict the impact to their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In December 2018, the EPA proposed revised Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources. The proposed rule would amend the previous determination that the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed coal-fired steam generating units is no longer partial carbon capture and storage. Instead, the proposed revised best system of emission reduction for this source category is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle (e.g., supercritical steam conditions for large units and subcritical steam conditions for small units) in combination with best operating practices. In May 2024, the EPA withdrew the proposed revision to the performance standards for coal-fired steam generating units as part of a package of final rules addressing CO 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Water The CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities. Regulation 316(b) In October 2014, the final regulations under Section 316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over MGD. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power currently have and facilities, respectively, that are subject to the final regulations. Dominion Energy is also working with the EPA and state regulatory agencies to assess the applicability of Section 316(b) to hydroelectric facilities, including Virginia Power facilities. The Companies anticipate that they may have to install impingement control technologies at certain of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. The Companies are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technological and cost benefit studies. DESC is conducting studies and implementing plans as required by the rule to determine appropriate intake structure modifications at certain facilities to ensure compliance with this rule. While the impacts of this rule could be material to the Companies results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory

separate petitions for reconsideration of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule and stayed future compliance dates in the rule. Also in April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the EPA s request for a stay of the pending consolidated litigation challenging the rule while the EPA addresses the petitions for reconsideration. In September 2017, the EPA signed a rule to postpone the earliest compliance dates for certain waste streams regulations in the Effluent Limitations Guidelines final rule from November 2018 to November 2020; however, the latest date for compliance for these regulations was December 2023. In October 2020, the EPA released the final rule that extended the latest dates for compliance with individual facilities compliance dates that would vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range from to . In May 2024, the EPA released a final rule revising the 2015 and 2020 Effluent Limitations Guidelines, establishing more stringent standards for wastewater discharges for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category, which apply primarily to wastewater discharges at coal and oil steam generating stations. Individual facilities compliance dates will vary based on circumstances and the determination by state regulators and may range to , except in certain circumstances when a facility will be retired by . Dominion Energy expects to complete wastewater treatment technology retrofits and modifications at DESC s Williams generating station, with a similar project at DESC s Wateree generation station under evaluation, to meet the requirements with the existing regulatory framework in South Carolina providing rate recovery mechanisms for costs of the projects. As discussed in Note 2, the Companies recorded an increase to their AROs in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the expected compliance costs associated with the EPA s May 2024 final rule concerning CCR. The Companies expect that such AROs would satisfy any AROs that would have otherwise been necessary for compliance with the EPA s May 2024 Effluent Limitations Guidelines. Dominion Energy is currently unable to estimate what costs, if any, may be required in addition to the project for the Williams generating station, a potential project at the Wateree generating station and the recorded AROs to meet the requirements to operate certain facilities past 2034. However, Dominion Energy expects that while such costs for facility improvements, if required, could be material to the Companies financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory frameworks in Virginia and South Carolina provide rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts. Waste Management and Remediation The operations of the Companies are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and release of hazardous substances associated with current and/or historical operations. The CERCLA, as amended, and similar state laws, may impose joint, several and strict liability for cleanup on potentially responsible parties who owned, operated or arranged for disposal at facilities affected by a release of hazardous substances. In addition, many states have created programs to incentivize voluntary remediation of sites where historical releases of hazardous substances are identified and property owners or responsible parties decide to initiate cleanups. From time to time, the Companies may be identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the alleged release of hazardous substances or wastes at a site. Under applicable federal and state laws, the Companies could be responsible for costs associated with the investigation or remediation of impacted sites, or subject to contribution claims by other responsible parties for their costs incurred at such sites. The Companies also may identify, evaluate and remediate other potentially impacted sites under voluntary state programs. Remediation costs may be subject to reimbursement under the Companies insurance policies, rate recovery mechanisms, or both. Except as described below, the Companies do not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Dominion Energy has determined that it is associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, including certain sites associated with Virginia Power. At sites associated with Dominion Energy, remediation work has been substantially completed under federal or state oversight. Where required, the sites are following state-approved groundwater monitoring programs. Dominion Energy has proposed remediation plans for site at Virginia Power and expects to commence remediation activities in 2025 depending on receipt of final permits and approvals. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Dominion Energy had million and million, respectively, of reserves recorded. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Virginia Power had million of reserves recorded. Dominion Energy is associated with additional sites, including associated with Virginia Power, which are not under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency nor the subject of any current or proposed plans to perform remediation activities. Due to the uncertainty surrounding such sites, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.

million, excluding interest, from the SCDOR following its audit of DESC s sales and use tax returns for the periods September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017. The proposed assessment, which includes of the NND Project, is based on the SCDOR s position that DESC s sales and use tax exemption for the NND Project does not apply because the facility will not become operational. In December 2020, the parties reached an agreement in principle in the amount of million to resolve this matter. In June 2021, the parties executed a settlement agreement which allows DESC to fund the settlement amount through a combination of cash, shares of Dominion Energy common stock or real estate with an initial payment of at least million in shares of Dominion Energy common stock. In August 2021, Dominion Energy issued million shares of its common stock to satisfy DESC s obligation for the initial payment under the settlement agreement. In May 2022, Dominion Energy issued an additional million shares of its common stock to partially satisfy DESC s remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In June 2022, DESC requested approval from the South Carolina Commission to transfer certain real estate with a total settlement value of million to satisfy its remaining obligation under the settlement agreement. In July 2022, the South Carolina Commission voted to approve the request and issued its final order in August 2022. In September 2022, DESC transferred certain non-utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR under the settlement agreement. In December 2022, DESC transferred additional utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR. In October 2022, DESC filed for approval to transfer the remaining real estate with FERC which was received in November 2022. In March 2023, DESC transferred utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of million million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets in Dominion Energy s Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2023, DESC transferred the remaining utility property with a fair value of million to the SCDOR resulting in a gain of million million after-tax), recorded in losses (gains) on sales of assets in Dominion Energy s Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In July 2023, DESC made a less than million cash payment to the SCDOR to fully satisfy its remaining obligation, including applicable interest, under the settlement agreement. Nuclear Operations Nuclear Insurance Other than the items discussed below, there have been no significant changes regarding the Companies nuclear insurance as described in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the total liability protection per nuclear incident available to all participants in the Secondary Financial Protection Program increased from billion to billion. This increase does not impact Dominion Energy s responsibility per active unit under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. Additionally, the Companies increased the amount of coverage purchased from commercial insurance pools for Millstone, Summer, Surry and North Anna from million to million with the remainder provided through the mandatory industry retrospective rating plan. Spent Nuclear Fuel As discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Companies entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.

In July 2024, the agreement was amended to reflect Dominion Energy s election to the lease term through . At the end of the lease term, Dominion Energy can (i) extend the term of the lease for at least , subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or, (iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property on behalf of the lessor to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion Energy may be required to make a payment to the lessor equal to the recorded lease balance. 

In addition, Dominion Energy had issued an additional million of guarantees at September 30, 2024, primarily to support third parties. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. Dominion Energy also had issued four guarantees as of September 30, 2024 related to Cove Point, previously an equity method investment, in support of terminal services, transportation and construction. Two of the Cove Point guarantees have a cumulative maximum exposure of billion while the other two guarantees have no maximum limit. No amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 , Dominion Energy had purchased million of surety bonds, including million at Virginia Power, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties.

At September 30, 2024 , Virginia Power s exposure related to wholesale customers totaled million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those 

 60 

. single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded million of exposure. Credit-Related Contingent Provisions Certain of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to provide collateral upon the occurrence of specific events, primarily a credit rating downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power would have been required to post additional collateral to its counterparties of million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 , and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 . The collateral that would be required to be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives, non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had posted collateral at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. In addition, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had both posted letters of credit as collateral with counterparties covering less than million of fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2023 . The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash for Dominion Energy and Virginia Power was million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Remeasurements In the first quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the close of the East Ohio Transaction. The remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of pension plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the pension benefit obligation of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of 

 62 

million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing. In addition, the remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of the other postretirement benefit plan assets of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing. The impact of the remeasurement and transfer of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities on net periodic benefit cost (credit) was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date. The remeasurement is expected to decrease the net periodic pension benefit credit by approximately million and increase the net periodic other postretirement benefit credit by approximately million for the year ending December 31, 2024, excluding the impact of a one-time plan amendment. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was for the pension plans and - for the other postretirement benefit plans. The net actuarial loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) related to the transferred pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities included in the East Ohio Transaction loss on sale was million for pension and million for other postretirement benefits. In the second quarter of 2024, Dominion Energy remeasured its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the close of the Questar Gas Transaction. The remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of pension plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the pension benefit obligation of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing, and a decrease in the fair value of the pension plan assets of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing. In addition, the remeasurement and transfer to Enbridge of other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing, and an increase in the fair value of the other postretirement benefit plan assets of million, inclusive of million transferred upon closing. The impact of the remeasurement and transfer of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and liabilities on net periodic benefit cost (credit) was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date. The remeasurement is expected to increase the net periodic pension benefit credit by approximately million and increase the net periodic other postretirement benefit credit by million for the year ending December 31, 2024. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was for the pension plan and for the other postretirement benefit plan. The net actuarial loss and prior service cost (credit) related to the transferred pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities included in the Questar Gas Transaction loss on sale was million for pension a nd million for other postretirement benefits. All other assumptions used for the remeasurements were consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2023. Employer Contributions During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Dominion Energy made million and million of contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans.

Overview 
 Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023 
 Net income attributable to Dominion Energy increased 797 million, primarily due to the absence of a charge to reflect the recognition of deferred taxes on the outside basis of stock associated with East Ohio, PSNC, Questar Gas and Wexpro meeting the classification as held for sale, higher rider equity returns reflecting increased capital investments at Virginia Power and an increase in net investment earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, partially offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Energy s remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point.

 Impairment of assets and other charges increased 27 , primarily due to a charge related to the write-off of certain early-stage development costs 30 million) and the absence of a benefit related to dismantling costs and other activities associated with certain retired electric generation facilities 10 million), partially offset by the absence of a charge for the write-off of certain previously deferred amounts related to the cessation of certain riders effective July 2023 36 million). 
 76 

Other income increased 92 , primarily due to an increase in net investment gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds 54 million) and an increase in AFUDC associated with rate-regulated projects 21 million). 
 
 Interest and related charges increased 10 , primarily due to an increase in long-term debt borrowings 129 million) and increased interest expense associated with rider deferrals 23 million), which is offset in operating revenue and does not impact net income, partially offset by a decrease in principal on commercial paper and intercompany borrowings with Dominion Energy 86 million). 
 
 Income tax expense increased 24 , primarily due to higher pre-tax income 128 million), partially offset by a nuclear production tax credit 53 million).

MD A in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Future Issues and Other Matters, Virginia Power closed on the sale of a 50 noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak in October 2024, with such noncontrolling interest expected to decrease net income attributable to Dominion Energy beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Dominion Energy depends on both cash generated from operations and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term financings. Dominion Energy s material cash requirements include capital and investment expenditures, repaying short-term and long-term debt obligations and paying dividends on its common and preferred stock.

Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by Dominion Energy s operating activities decreased 809 million, inclusive of a 32 million increase from discontinued operations. Net cash provided by continuing operations decreased 841 million primarily due to lower deferred fuel and purchased gas cost recoveries 250 million), settlements of interest rate swaps 205 million) and an increase in interest payments driven by higher interest rates and borrowings 81 million), higher net prepayments and deposits 293 million) and 336 million primarily due to lower operating cash flows from electric utility operations, partially offset by an increase from changes in working capital 324 million). 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash from Dominion Energy s investing activities increased 4.4 billion, primarily due to net proceeds from the East Ohio, Questar Gas and PSNC Transactions 9.2 billion) and an increase in distributions from equity method affiliates 125 million), partially offset by the absence of the net proceeds from the sale of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Cove Point 3.3 billion), an increase in plant construction and other property additions 1.6 billion) and higher acquisitions of solar development projects 188 million). 
 80 

Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash from Dominion Energy s financing activities decreased 1.9 billion, primarily due to a 7.5 billion decrease due to net repayments on 364-day term loan facilities in 2024 versus net issuances in 2023, net repayment of credit facility borrowings 900 million), the partial repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock 440 million) and net repayments of short-term debt 214 million), partially offset by a 7.2 billion increase due to net issuances of long-term debt in 2024 versus net repayments in 2023. 
 Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt 
 As discussed in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy generally uses proceeds from short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, to satisfy short-term cash requirements not met through cash from operations. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending on the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. There have been no significant changes to Dominion Energy s use of credit facilities and/or short-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Joint Revolving Credit Facility 
 Dominion Energy maintains a 6.0 billion joint revolving credit facility which provides for a discount in the pricing of certain annual fees and amounts borrowed by Dominion Energy under the facility if Dominion Energy achieves certain annual renewable electric generation and diversity and inclusion objectives. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy had 2.4 billion of unused capacity under its joint revolving credit facility. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for the balances of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. 
 Dominion Energy Reliability Investment SM Program 
 Dominion Energy has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the sale of up to 3.0 billion of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, called Dominion Energy Reliability Investment SM . The registration limits the principal amount that may be outstanding at any one time to 1.0 billion. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Dominion Energy or at the investor s option at any time. At September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy s Consolidated Balance Sheet included 482 million presented within short-term debt. The proceeds are used for general corporate purposes and to repay debt. 
 Other Facilities 
 In addition to the primary sources of short-term liquidity discussed above, from time to time Dominion Energy enters into separate supplementary credit facilities or term loans as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
 In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full 2.5 billion outstanding under its 2.5 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in January 2023 as amended in January 2024, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in July 2024. 
 In March 2024, Dominion Energy repaid 1.8 billion of its 2.25 billion 364-day term loan facility entered into in October 2023, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the East Ohio Transaction. Subsequently in March 2024, Dominion Energy requested and received a 500 million increase to the amount of the facility and concurrently borrowed 500 million with the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In May 2024, Dominion Energy repaid the full 976 million outstanding under the facility, using after-tax proceeds received in connection with the Questar Gas Transaction. The debt was scheduled to mature in October 2024. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility 
 Dominion Energy maintains a 900 million Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility which, following an amendment in June 2024, matures in June 2025 and bears interest at a variable rate and is described in Note 18 to the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The facility offers a reduced interest rate margin with respect to borrowed amounts allocated to certain environmental sustainability or social investment initiatives. In May 2024, Dominion Energy used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 EJSNs discussed below to repay the outstanding balance of 450 million under the Sustainability Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Issuances and Borrowings of Long-Term Debt 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy issued or borrowed the following long-term debt. Unless otherwise noted, the proceeds for senior notes were used for the repayment of existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.

Dominion Energy currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communication and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion Energy to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions. 
 Dominion Energy anticipates, excluding potential opportunistic financings and the securitization bonds, issuing between approximately 3.0 billion and 4.8 billion of long-term debt during 2024, inclusive of amounts issued through September 30, 2024 as shown in the table above. Dominion Energy expects to issue long-term debt to satisfy cash needs for capital expenditures and maturing long-term debt to the extent such amounts are not satisfied from cash available from operations following the payment of dividends, proceeds from the completion of the sale of a 50 noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project and any borrowings made from unused capacity of Dominion Energy s credit facilities discussed above. The raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances. 
 Repayments, Repurchases and Redemptions of Long-Term Debt 
 Dominion Energy may from time to time reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity or repurchases of debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise. 
 The following long-term debt was repaid, repurchased or redeemed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 82 

Remarketing of Long-Term Debt 
 In May 2024, Virginia Power remarketed three series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of 243 million to new investors. All three series of bonds will bear interest at a coupon of 3.80 until May 2027, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. 
 Credit Ratings 
 As discussed in the Companies Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Dominion Energy s credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities. The credit ratings for Dominion Energy are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the applicable rating organization. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in Dominion Energy s credit ratings from those described in the Companies Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In June 2024, Standard Poor s revised its credit ratings outlook for Dominion Energy from negative to stable and affirmed all other current ratings.

Future Issues and Other Matters in the Companies Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, with the exception of the items described below. 
 
 CVOW Commercial Project 
 In September 2019, Virginia Power filed applications with PJM for the CVOW Commercial Project and for certain approvals and rider recovery from the Virginia Commission in November 2021. The total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately 10 billion, excluding financing costs. Virginia Power s current estimate for the 2.6 GW project s projected levelized cost of energy, including renewable energy credits, is approximately 56/MWh, compared to the initial filing submission of 80-90/MWh. Virginia Power commenced major onshore construction activities in November 2023 following the receipt of a record of decision from BOEM in October 2023 for construction of the CVOW Commercial Project. Virginia Power commenced major offshore construction activities in May 2024 following the receipt in January 2024 of final approval from BOEM authorizing offshore construction and necessary permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for offshore construction. The project is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026. Through September 30, 2024, Virginia Power had incurred approximately 5.3 billion of costs. In April 2024, a motion was filed in the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit requesting a preliminary injunction in connection with a complaint filed related to the administrative process for certain permits and approvals received. In May 2024, the U.S. District Court for the DC Circuit denied the motion. As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in accordance with the Virginia Commission s order in December 2022 for incremental construction costs which fall between 10.3 billion and 13.7 billion. Also as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Virginia Power entered into an agreement in February 2024 to sell a 50 noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the formation of OSWP. In October 2024, Virginia Power and Stonepeak closed on the agreement following satisfaction of regulatory approvals, including from BOEM and the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. At closing, Virginia Power received 2.6 billion, representing 50 of the CVOW Commercial Project construction costs incurred through closing, less an initial withholding of 145 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for more information. 
 
 Offshore Wind Vessel Leasing Arrangement 
 In December 2020, Dominion Energy signed an agreement (most recently amended in August 2024) with a lessor to complete construction of and lease a Jones Act compliant offshore wind installation vessel. This vessel is designed to handle current turbine technologies as well as next generation turbines. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors, totaling 715 million, to fund project costs. Including financing costs, total estimated project costs are approximately 715 million. The project is expected to be completed in early 2025. The initial lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the vessel is delivered and will mature after five years. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information. 
 
 Dominion Energy Virginia Nuclear Operating Licenses 
 In 2020, Virginia Power applied for renewal of its operating licenses for an additional 20 years for the two nuclear units at North Anna. In August 2024, the NRC approved Virginia Power s application, allowing the units to generate electricity through 2058 and 2060. 
 
 Potential Regulated Electric Generation and Transmission Projects 
 In October 2024, Dominion Energy announced a joint planning initiative with AEP and FirstEnergy. As part of the initiative, the companies have jointly submitted initial project proposals for 765-kV, 500-kV and 345-kV transmission lines in Virginia, Ohio and West Virginia to PJM. If any such proposals are selected by PJM, the participating companies would then undertake an extensive, multi-year process to develop, construct and subsequently operate the transmission line.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 
 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The matters discussed in this Item may contain forward-looking statements as described in the introductory paragraphs under Part I., Item 2. MD A in this report. The reader s attention is directed to those paragraphs for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies. 
 Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management 
 The Companies financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity securities prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in the Companies electric operations and Dominion Energy s natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities. The Companies exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is related to certain fixed price contracts associated with the CVOW Commercial Project which it manages through foreign currency exchange rate derivatives. The contracts include services denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for approximately 2.6 billion and 5.1 billion kr. In addition, certain of the fixed price contracts, approximately 0.7 billion, contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel. 
 The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10 change in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 To manage price risk, the Companies hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. 
 The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices. 
 A hypothetical 10 increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of 22 million and 62 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 A hypothetical 10 decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of 22 million and a hypothetical 10 increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of 24 million in the fair value of Virginia Power s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity-based financial derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. For variable rate debt outstanding for Dominion Energy, a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates would result in a 22 million and 56 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For variable rate debt outstanding for Virginia Power, a hypothetical 10 increase in market interest rates would result in an 7 million and 5 million decrease in earnings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Companies also use interest rate derivatives, including forward-starting swaps, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power had 10.3 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10 decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 50 million and 49 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power s interest rate derivatives at September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy and 
 86 

Virginia Power had 16.3 billion and 3.3 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10 decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 120 million and 151 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2023. 
 The impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The Companies utilize foreign currency exchange rate swaps to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with fixed price contracts related to the CVOW Commercial Project denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Dominion Energy had 1.5 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency forward purchase agreements outstanding. A hypothetical 10 increase in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of 147 million and 202 million in the fair value of Dominion Energy s foreign currency swaps at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The impact of a change in exchange rates on the Companies foreign currency-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from foreign exchange derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction. 
 Investment Price Risk 
 The Companies are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Companies Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. 
 
 Dominion Energy recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of 1.0 billion, 409 million and 879 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion Energy recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on debt investments of 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 117 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net decrease of 14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Virginia Power recognized net investment gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of 526 million, 206 million and 448 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on debt investments of 25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 66 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a net decrease of 8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Dominion Energy sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power employees participate in these plans. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Senior management of both Dominion Energy and Virginia Power, including Dominion Energy and Virginia Power s CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of each company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, each of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power s CEO and CFO have concluded that each company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 There were no changes that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Dominion Energy or Virginia Power s internal control over financial reporting. 
 87 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
