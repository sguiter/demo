 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 
 Fair Value Measurements

 Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2. Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
 Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, Level 1 equity securities recorded at fair value totaled and , respectively, and are classified as other non-current assets. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there were Level 2 or Level 3 equity securities recorded at fair value.

RSAs are subject to time-based restrictions on transfer and unvested portions are generally subject to a risk of forfeiture if the award recipient ceases providing services to the Company prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The stock-based compensation expense for these awards is determined using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The RSAs have time conditions and in some cases, once the stock vests, the individual is restricted from selling the shares of stock for a certain defined period, from to , depending on the terms of the RSA.

 Company Overview 
 Digital Turbine, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively Digital Turbine or the Company ), is a leading independent mobile growth platform that levels up the landscape for advertisers, publishers, carriers, and device original equipment manufacturers OEMs ). We offer end-to-end products and solutions leveraging proprietary technology to all participants in the mobile application ecosystem, enabling brand discovery and advertising, user acquisition and engagement, and operational efficiency for advertisers. In addition, our products and solutions provide monetization opportunities for OEMs, carriers, and application app or apps publishers and developers. 
 Recent Developments 
 Impact of Economic Conditions and Geopolitical Developments 
 Our results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical developments, including but not limited to levels of business and consumer confidence, actions taken by governments to counter inflation, potential trade disputes, including but not limited to any U.S. government actions against China based developers and publishers, Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and the recent conflict in Israel. 
 Inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and reduced business and consumer confidence have caused and may continue to cause a global slowdown of economic activity, which has caused and may continue to cause a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including those provided by our clients. 
 We are impacted by the volume of sales of new mobile devices by our partners, which has been below our expectations. We believe this is driven by the impact of inflation, economic uncertainty, and their potential impacts on consumers. These negative macroeconomic trends have resulted, and may continue to result in, a decrease in mobile phone sales volume. Continued weakness in the sale of new mobile devices is likely to continue to impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, the full impact of which remains uncertain at this time.

 Further, various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies continue to examine the distribution and use of apps developed and/or published by China based companies. In some cases, government agencies have banned certain apps from mobile devices. Further actions by U.S. federal or state governmental agencies or other countries to restrict or ban the distribution of China based apps could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 While Russia s invasion of Ukraine has not had a direct, material impact on our business, any European conflict, if expanded to include other countries, would likely have a material, negative impact on general economic conditions and would impact our business directly. 
 Additionally, we continue to actively monitor the recent and ongoing conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip for any material impacts to our business. While no adverse financial or operational impacts have been noted in the current period, if such conflict continues or escalates, it could have a potential negative impact on our business, given our significant presence in the region. 
 The extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance is also dependent on their impact on carriers and OEMs in relation to their sales of smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as well as the impact on application developers and in-app advertisers. If negative macroeconomic factors or geopolitical developments materially impact our partners over a prolonged period, our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely impacted, the size and duration of which we cannot accurately predict at this time. 
 We continue to actively monitor these factors and we may take further actions that alter our business operations, as required, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. In addition to monitoring the developments described above, the Company also considers the impact such factors may have on our accounting estimates and potential impairments of our non-current assets, which primarily consist of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets. 
 The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment, including qualitative and quantitative factors such as the identification of reporting units, identification and allocation of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determinations of fair value. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units when performing our annual impairment test, or when an indicator of impairment is present, we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of those reporting units and other estimates including appropriate discount rates. Discount rates can fluctuate based on various economic conditions including our capital allocation and interest rates, including the interest rates on U.S. treasury bonds. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates, particularly expectations of revenue and cash flow growth rates in future periods and discount rates, could result in goodwill impairment charges. 
 In addition to evaluating goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate they would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company also evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. The Company s next annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment will be as of March 31, 2025. 
 Finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period or an impairment. We test these assets for potential impairment whenever we conclude events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
 Business Transformation Initiative 
 Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the Company entered into a business transformation project that includes the implementation of a new, global cloud-based enterprise resource planning ERP system to upgrade our existing enterprise-wide operating systems. Additionally, a new human resource system was also implemented to streamline employee management processes and enhance organizational effectiveness. We are also undertaking the consolidation of existing ancillary systems and deploying other new platforms and systems to improve our operations and drive business and cost efficiencies.

Table of Contents 

 This is a multi-year project that includes various costs, including software configuration and implementation costs that would be recognized as either capital expenditures or deferred costs in accordance with applicable accounting policies, with certain costs recognized as operating expense associated with project development and project management costs, and professional services with business partners engaged in the planning, design and business process review that would not qualify as software configuration and implementation costs. In addition, the Company is incurring duplicative personnel and other operating costs to maintain legacy systems and operations during the deployment of the new systems and certain other ancillary platforms and systems. The Company completed the first deployment phase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Costs are anticipated to be incurred through various deployment phases that are expected to continue through early fiscal year 2026. The Company incurred 1,309 of business transformation costs during the six months ended September 30, 2024. These costs are recorded in General and Administrative expenses and Product Development expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 
 
 Additionally, the Company is in the process of initiating further transformation efforts, a portion of which include various measures across the organization to reduce current and future operating expenses and improve cash flows, including a reduction in force, reductions in personnel costs, and steps intended to simplify and streamline business operations. As part of these transformation efforts, we are currently implementing a reduction in our workforce. Thereafter, to further reduce operating expenses and improve cash flows, we plan to implement additional transformation activities, including but not limited subsequent reductions in force. The program is underway and is targeted to yield more than 25,000 in annual cash expense savings. The Company expects the program to be substantially implemented by the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.

Table of Contents 

 ODS revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 16,646 or 16.8 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from content media increased by approximately 565 primarily due to increased activity with a carrier that resulted in higher daily active users on prepaid devices. Revenue from application media decreased by approximately 17,211. The decrease was primarily driven by lower new device volumes and revenue-per-device in the US region and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions. These decreases were partially offset by higher device volumes and revenue-per-device in the Asia Pacific and China regions. 
 
 ODS revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 34,246 or 17.4 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from content media increased by approximately 1,317 for the same reason as noted above for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, application media revenue declined by approximately 35,563 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The decline in revenue in application media was primarily due to lower device volumes and lower revenue-per-device in the US region and internationally, resulting in a 25,362 decrease in revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher device volumes and revenue-per-device in the Asia Pacific and China regions. This decrease was also driven by lower revenue from strategic demand customers of approximately 10,201. 
 App Growth Platform 
 AGP revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 8,837 or 19.1 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Performance and brand advertising revenue declined by approximately 268 and advertising exchange revenue declined by approximately 8,594, primarily due to weaker demand and the impact of the consolidation and exiting of certain legacy AdColony platforms and business lines. The decrease in advertising exchange revenue was primarily due to lower performance in the US and Canada regions, partially offset by higher performance in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions of 1,169. Revenues from reseller partnerships remained flat between the comparable periods. 
 AGP revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 19,404 or 20.4 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Performance and brand advertising revenue declined by approximately 4,617 and advertising exchange revenue declined by approximately 14,824, primarily due to weaker demand and the impact of the consolidation and exiting of certain legacy AdColony platforms and business lines. The decrease in advertising exchange revenue was primarily due to lower performance in the US and Canada regions. Revenues from reseller partnerships remained flat between the comparable periods.

 included an impairment of goodwill of 147,181. Excluding the impairment of goodwill, total costs of revenue and operating expenses decreased by 16,425 or 11.0 and 33,429 or 11.2 , respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in total costs of revenue and operating expenses for both comparative periods, after excluding the impairment of goodwill, was primarily due to lower revenue share and product development costs, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs. The reduced revenue share is the result of lower revenue over the same comparative periods. Costs of revenue and operating expenses included total business transformation, severance and transaction costs of 505 and 2,134 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3,416 and 3,819 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In connection with the Company s transformation efforts, business transformation and severance costs are expected to increase in the future remaining quarters of fiscal year 2025. 
 Revenue share 
 Revenue share includes amounts paid to our carrier and OEM partners, as well as app publishers and developers, and are recorded as a cost of revenue. 
 Revenue share decreased by 12,383 or 18.0 to 56,336 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was 47.4 as a percentage of total net revenue compared to 68,719, or 48.0 of total net revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue share decreased by 26,166 or 18.9 to 112,145 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and was 47.4 as a percentage of total net revenue compared to 138,311, or 47.8 of total net revenue, for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in revenue share was attributable to the decrease in total net revenue over the same periods, as these costs are typically paid as a percentage of our revenue. Revenue share as a percentage of total net revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparative periods remained flat. 
 Other direct costs of revenue 
 Other direct costs of revenue are comprised primarily of hosting expenses directly related to the generation of revenue and depreciation expense associated with capitalized software costs and amortization of developed technology intangible assets. 
 Other direct costs of revenue decreased by 579 or 6.4 to 8,438 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was 7.1 as a percentage of total net revenue compared to 9,017, or 6.3 of total net revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other direct costs of revenue decreased by 2,402 or 12.9 to 16,228 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and was 6.9 as a percentage of total net revenue compared to 18,630, or 6.4 of total net revenue, for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in other direct costs was primarily due to lower amortization of developed technology intangible assets, lower hosting costs as a result of both a strategic switch in web hosting providers during fiscal year 2024, and a comparable decrease in total net revenues between comparable periods. The increase in other direct costs of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was due to the decline in total net revenue. 
 Product development 
 
 Product development expenses include the development and maintenance of the Company s product suite. Expenses in this area are primarily a function of personnel. Additionally, product development expenses include certain integration and business transformation costs, which may impact the comparability of product development expenses between periods. 
 
 Product development expenses decreased by 4,604 or 32.8 to 9,433 for the three months ended

These increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation of approximately 2,001.

 Interest expense, net 
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense, net, increased by 1,388 or 17.7 and 2,248 or 14.8 , respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates of 112 basis points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. Further, average outstanding borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5,433 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, contributing to the increase in interest expense, while the average outstanding borrowings for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4,267 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, partially offsetting the increase in interest rates for the six month period. 
 Income tax provision (benefit) 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, a tax provision expense of 1,400 and 3,150, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of (5.9) and (6.7) , respectively. Differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate primarily relate to foreign income expense and a valuation allowance on loss from operations. 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, a tax benefit of 713 and 2,252, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 0.4 and 1.3 , respectively. Differences between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate primarily relate to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, tax limitations on certain deductions and state tax benefits. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, and borrowings under our Credit Agreement Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. BoA ). As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash of approximately 32,081 and restricted cash of approximately 684. Restricted cash consists primarily of cash held by a bank in a collateral account as collateral to cover the Company's corporate credit cards. The Company had 14,000 available to draw under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with BoA, excluding the accordion feature, subject to the required covenants. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement matures in 2026. We incurred a net loss of (24,986) and (50,142), respectively, and used cash in operating activities of (8,719) and (10,071), respectively for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our principal cash requirements for the twelve-month period following this report primarily consists of personnel costs, contractual payment obligations, including office leases, cloud hosting costs, capital expenditures, minimum commitments under hosting agreements (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Hosting Agreements below) payment of interest and required principal payments under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, cash outlays for income taxes, and cash requirements to fund working capital. In the longer term, we would expect to have similar cash requirements. 
 We are exploring various cost saving opportunities, namely through the Company s recently initiated transformation efforts, and we intend to continue seeking opportunities to generate additional revenue through operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plans described above. If we are unable to effectively implement additional cost reductions, generate additional revenue or refinance our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or raise additional funding, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our strategic operational efforts and product and service expansion, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and undrawn available balance under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other business requirements for at least 12 months from the filing date of this Report. However, our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in our business will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our ability to access capital markets as well as financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors such as health epidemics, economic and macro-economic factors like labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, and geopolitical developments, including the conflict in Ukraine, the political climate related to China, and the conflict in Israel. We cannot guarantee we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings or capital markets will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our outstanding secured indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is 411,000 as of September 30, 2024. The maturity date of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is April 29, 2026, and the outstanding balance is classified as long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs of 3,380, on our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. For further description of the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, see Note 10 Debt under the heading Revolver in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 
 The collateral pledged to secure our secured debt, consisting of substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries assets, would be available to the secured creditor in a foreclosure, in addition to many other remedies. Accordingly, any adverse change in our ability to service our secured debt could result in an event of default, cross default, and foreclosure or forced sale. Depending on the value of the assets, there could be little, if any, assets available for common stockholders in any foreclosure or forced sale. 
 Our credit facility also contains a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. If we fail to satisfy these covenants, the lender may declare a default, which could lead to acceleration of the debt maturity. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on August 6, 2024 to renegotiate its required covenants. Refer to Note 10 Debt for further discussion. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 Hosting Agreements 
 We enter into hosting agreements with service providers, and, in some cases, those agreements include minimum commitments that require us to purchase a minimum amount of service over a specified time period the minimum commitment period ). The minimum commitment period is generally one year in duration, and the hosting agreements include multiple minimum commitment periods. Our minimum purchase commitments under these hosting agreements total approximately 252,866 over the next six fiscal years.

 Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by revenue generated from user acquisition and advertising activity, offset by the cash costs of operations, and are significantly influenced by the timing of and fluctuations in receipts from customers and payments to our carrier and publisher partners as well as other vendors. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be diminished if we cannot increase our revenue levels and manage costs appropriately. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was (10,071) for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28,772 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 38,843 was due to the following: 
 119,739 decrease in net loss; 
 4,631 decrease due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, driven primarily by working capital changes, specifically accounts payable and other current liabilities; 
 153,951 decrease in non-cash charges during the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the impairment of goodwill reported for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions of businesses, purchases of property and equipment, and capital expenditures in support of creating and enhancing our technology infrastructure. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities decreased by 869 to 13,408. Our cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to internally-developed software. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 23,372, which was comprised of: (1) the repayment of debt obligations of 13,000, (2) a payment of 1,561 for debt issuance costs, and (3) payment of payroll withholding taxes for net share settlement of equity awards of 160. These cash outflows were offset by cash inflows comprising of proceeds from borrowings of 38,000 and stock option exercises of 93. 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 29,195, which was comprised of repayment of debt obligations of 44,136, payment of payroll withholding taxes for net share settlement of equity awards of 1,037, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from borrowings of 17,000 and stock option exercises of 2,729.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements is based on management s selection and application of accounting policies, some of which require management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, please see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of this Report on Form 10-Q for our fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company has operations both within the U.S. and internationally and is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business - primarily interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. 
 Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk 
 The primary objective of the Company s investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. The Company s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and deposits, which are sensitive to interest rate changes. 
 The Company s borrowings under its credit facility are subject to variable interest rates and thus expose the Company to interest rate fluctuations, depending on the extent to which the Company utilizes its credit facility. If market interest rates materially increase, the Company s results of operations could be adversely affected. A hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in interest expense of 10 per year for every 1,000 of outstanding debt under the Company s credit facility. The Company has not used any derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk exposure. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the Company s results of operations and/or financial condition could be affected by changes in exchange rates. The Company has transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, Turkish lira, and British pound, that expose the Company s operations to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements. Such movements may impact future revenues, expenses, and cash flows. In certain of the Company s foreign operations, the Company transacts primarily in the U.S. dollar, including for net revenue, revenue share, and employee-related compensation costs, which reduces the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. In addition, gains (losses) related to translating certain cash balances, trade accounts receivable and payable balances, and intercompany balances also impact net income. As the Company s foreign operations expand, results may be impacted further by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which the Company does business. The Company has not used any derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign currency exchange risk exposure. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, regardless of how well they were designed and are operating, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company may be involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues a liability when it is both probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period such determination is made. For some matters, the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made. 
 On June 6, 2022 and July 21, 2022, stockholders of the Company filed class action complaints against the Company and certain of the Company s officers in the Western District of Texas related to Digital Turbine, Inc. s announcement in May 2022 that it would restate some of its financial results. The claims allege violations of certain federal securities laws. These have been consolidated into In re Digital Turbine, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. 1:22-cv-00550-DAE. On July 19, 2023, the Western District court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 23, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on September 22, 2023, and briefing on the motion to dismiss is complete as of November 13, 2023. On August 22, 2024, the court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs had thirty days to file a notice of appeal and did not do so. In addition, several derivative actions have been filed against the Company and the Company s directors, which all assert claims of breach of fiduciary duties arising out of the same facts as the securities class action. The cases are Olszanski v. Digital Turbine, Inc., et al.; Case No. 1:22-cv-911 in federal court in the Western District of Texas (October 4, 2022); Witt v. Digital Turbine, Inc., et al; Case 1:22-cv-01429-UNA in federal court in the District of Delaware (February 14, 2023); and Krumwiede v. Digital Turbine, Inc.; Case No. 2023-0277 in state court in the Delaware Chancery Court (March 6, 2023). The federal derivative cases were stayed pending a final, non-appealable ruling on any motion to dismiss the federal class action. The Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Delaware Chancery case on May 11, 2023. On October 24, 2024, the plaintiffs in Olszanski v. Digital Turbine, Inc., et al., Case 
 No. 1:22-cv-911 filed a notice of dismissal. The Company and individual defendants deny any allegations of wrongdoing and the Company plans to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in these complaints. Due to the early stages of these cases, management is unable to assess a likely outcome or potential liability at this time. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Other than as set forth below, the Company is not aware of any material changes to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2024. 
 Our transformation activities and reduction in force may not adequately reduce our operating costs or improve our op erating margins or cash flows, may lead to additional workforce attrition and may cause operational disruptions. 
 
 The Company is in the process of initiating further transformation efforts, a portion of which include various measures across the organization to reduce current and future operating expenses and improve cash flows, including a reduction in force, reductions in personnel costs, and steps intended to simplify and streamline business operations. As part of these transformation efforts, we are currently implementing a reduction in our workforce. Thereafter, to further reduce operating expenses and improve cash flows, we plan to implement additional restructuring activities, including but not limited to subsequent reductions in force. The program is underway and is targeted to yield more than 25,000 in annual cash expense savings. The Company expects the program to be substantially implemented by the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. 
 
 The charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the transformation activities and reduction in force, and timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and we may incur costs that are greater than we currently expect in connection with the transformation activities and reduction in force. The transformation activities and reduction in force may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, employee attrition 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 beyond our intended reductions in force, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, greater-than-anticipated costs incurred in connection with implementing the transformation activities and reduction in force and the risk that we may not achieve the benefits from the transformation activities and reduction in force to the extent or as quickly as we anticipate, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. These restructuring initiatives could place substantial demands on our management and employees, which could lead to the diversion of our management's and employees' attention from other business priorities. In addition, while we eliminated certain positions in connection with the transformation activities and reduction in force, certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees or to external service providers, which could result in disruptions to our operations. We may also discover that the workforce reductions and other restructuring efforts will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. We may further discover that, despite the implementation of our transformation activities and reduction in force, we may require additional capital to continue expanding our business, and we may be unable to obtain such capital on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above activities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, we could lose the innovation, creativity, passion and teamwork that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. 
 
 We believe a critical contributor to our success has been our company culture, which we rely on to foster innovation, creativity, a customer-centric focus, passion, teamwork, collaboration and loyalty. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this co mpany culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to ensure employees effectively focus on and pursue our company objectives. As we continue to evolve our business, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. The effects of our transformation activities and planned reduction in workforce could make it more difficult to preserve our company culture and could negatively impact employee morale .
