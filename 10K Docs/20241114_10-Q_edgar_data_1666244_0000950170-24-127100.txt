. The of the new guidance have an impact on the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments . This ASU makes narrow-scope amendments related to various aspects pertaining to financial instruments and related disclosures by clarifying or improving the Codification. Certain guidance became effective for the Company for annual periods beginning January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted the guidance related to credit losses on the required effective date beginning . The of the new credit losses guidance have an impact on the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . The guidance is designed to provide relief from the accounting analysis and impacts that may otherwise be required for modifications to agreements (e.g., loans, debt securities, derivatives, and borrowings) necessitated by reference rate reform as entities transition away from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This ASU also provides optional expedients to enable companies to continue to apply hedge accounting to certain hedging relationships impacted by reference rate reform. Application of the guidance is optional and only available in certain situations. The ASU is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope . The amendments in this standard are elective and principally apply to entities that have derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform (referred to as the discounting transition ). The standard expands the scope of ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform and allows entities to elect optional expedients to derivative contracts impacted by the discounting transition. Similar to ASU No. 2020-04, provisions of this ASU are effective upon issuance and generally could be applied through December 31, 2022. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company elected to apply the practical expedients to modifications of qualifying contracts as continuation of the existing contract rather than as a new contract.

The standard is expected to reduce complexity and improve comparability of financial reporting associated with accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity. The ASU also enhances information transparency by making targeted improvements to the related disclosures guidance. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. The Company adopted the standard on the required effective date beginning , and it was applied using a modified retrospective method of transition.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The standard improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability, as well as payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The ASU requires companies to apply guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination, and, thus, creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in ASC 805, Business Combinations . The Company adopted the standard on the required effective date beginning , using a prospective transition method for business combinations occurring on or after the effective date. The of this guidance have an impact on the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements.

The standard eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance on TDRs for creditors after they have adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and requires them to make enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company adopted the standard on the required effective date beginning . The guidance for recognition and measurement of TDRs was applied using a prospective transition method, and the amendments related to disclosures were applied prospectively. The of this guidance have an impact on the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements.

These derivative instruments were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Other financial instruments The Company considers the carrying value of its Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash to approximate its fair value because of the short period of time between its origination and its expected realization as well as its highly-liquid nature.

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 The Company defines modified funds from operations MFFO in accordance with the definition established by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA. The Company s computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the current IPA definition. MFFO is calculated using funds from operations FFO ). The Company computes FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income or loss (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable properties, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment charges on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated/uncombined partnerships and joint ventures. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s cash flow generated by operations. The Company s computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition. MFFO excludes from FFO the following items, as applicable: 
 acquisition fees and expenses; 

straight-line rent and amortization of above or below intangible lease assets and liabilities; 

amortization of discounts, premiums and fees on debt investments; 

non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments; 

realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt; 

realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of the Company s business; 

unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings; 

unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; 

adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and 

adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above. 

FFO and MFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as an indication of performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not a measure of liquidity. FFO and MFFO should be considered in conjunction with reported net income and cash flows from operations computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as presented in the financial statements.

Net Asset Value 
 On October 18, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved an estimated NAV as of September 30, 2024 of 20.15 per Class AX, Class IX, and Class I shares, 20.14 for Class D shares, 20.13 for Class TX, Class T and Class S shares, and 20.15 for Class I OP units. The calculation of the Company s estimated NAV was performed by Robert A. Stanger Co., Inc. Stanger ), its independent valuation firm, in accordance with the procedures described in the Net Asset Value Calculation and Valuation Procedures section of the Company s prospectus and under the oversight of the Company s board of directors. Although the independent valuation firm performs the calculation of the Company s estimated NAV, the Company s board of directors is solely responsible for the determination of the Company s estimated NAV. 
 Estimated NAV 
 The determination of NAV involves a number of assumptions and judgments, including estimates of the Advisor s interest in disposition proceeds (if any). These assumptions and judgments may prove to be inaccurate. There can be no assurance that a stockholder would realize the mostly recently determined NAV per share if the Company were to liquidate or engage in another type of liquidity event today. In particular, the Company s September 30, 2024 NAV is based on appraisals of the fair market value of certain of the Company s real estate property investments which precede September 30, 2024 and, while the Company believes no material change has occurred in the value of these real estate property investments between the appraised value dates and September 30, 2024, Stanger has assumed no material change in property value has occurred since the appraisal date for those Appraised Properties with an appraised value date that preceded September 30, 2024. Furthermore, the Company s September 30, 2024 NAV does not consider fees or expenses that may be incurred in providing a liquidity event, including reimbursement of amounts to the Advisor for O O Costs and any operating expenses that have not been invoiced by the Advisor in accordance with the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement. Lastly, as discussed in PART II OTHER INFORMATION; Item 1A. Risk Factors , the full extent of the past and ongoing impact and effects of COVID-19 on the Company, as a whole, and on its tenants and its consolidated real estate, loan investments and long-term debt are uncertain at this time. Due to COVID-19, observable market transactions for both real estate assets and debt are generally more limited than before the pandemic. The Company believes the methodology of determining the Company s NAV conforms to the Institute for Portfolio Alternative s Practice Guideline for Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs (April 2013) and is prepared in accordance with the procedure described in the Net Asset Value Calculation and Valuation Procedures section of the Company s prospectus. In addition, the Company s board of directors periodically reviews the Company s NAV policies and procedures. 
 The NAV for each class of shares is based on the value of the Company s assets and the deduction of any liabilities, and any distribution fees applicable to such class of shares.

 The following details the adjustments to reconcile U.S. GAAP stockholders equity to the Company s NAV: 
 Unrealized depreciation of real estate 
 The Company s investments in real estate are presented at historical cost, including acquisition costs, in the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of the Company s investments in real estate are not included in the Company s U.S. GAAP results. For purposes of determining the Company s NAV, the Company s investments in real estate are presented at fair value. 
 Unrealized appreciation of real estate-related assets 
 The Company s investments in real estate-related assets are presented at historical cost, including acquisition costs, in the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of the Company s investments in real estate-related assets are not included in the Company s U.S. GAAP results. For purposes of determining the Company s NAV, the Company s investments in real estate-related assets are presented at fair value. 
 Acquisition costs 
 The Company capitalizes acquisition costs incurred with the acquisition of its investments in real estate in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such acquisition costs are not included in the value of real estate investments for purposes of determining NAV. 
 Deferred financing costs, net 
 Costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related loan in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such deferred financing costs are not included in the value of debt for purposes of determining NAV. 
 Accrued distribution fee 
 Accrued distribution fee represents the accrual for the full cost of the distribution fee for Class TX, Class T, Class D and Class S shares. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company accrues the full cost of the distribution fee as an offering cost at the time it sells the Class TX, Class T, Class D and Class S shares. For purposes of NAV, the Company recognizes the distribution fees as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fees are due. 
 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 
 The Company depreciates its investments in real estate and amortizes certain other assets and liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization is not considered for purposes of determining NAV. 
 63 

Fair value adjustment of debt obligations 
 The Company s debt obligations are presented at historical cost in the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases in the fair value of the Company s debt obligations are not included in the Company s U.S. GAAP results. For purposes of determining the Company s NAV, the Company s debt obligations are presented at fair value. 
 Deferred rent receivable 
 Deferred rent receivable represents rent earned in excess of rent received as a result of straight-lining rents over the term of the lease on certain of the Company s properties. Such deferred rent receivable is not considered for purposes of determining NAV. 
 Derivative assets, at fair value 
 Derivative assets, at fair value represents a cash flow hedge which the Company uses to hedge interest rate risk related to the Valencia Loan. Such Derivative assets, at fair value are not considered for purposes of determining NAV. 
 Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries 
 Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represents the equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary which is not attributable to the Company. The interests are presented at fair value for purposes of determining the Company s NAV. 
 The valuations of the Company's real properties as of September 30, 2024 were provided by Stanger or third-party appraisal firms in accordance with the Company's procedures. Certain key assumptions that were used by Stanger or third-party appraisal firms in the discounted cash flow analysis are set forth in the following table based on weighted-averages by property type at ownership interests.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company is dependent upon the net proceeds from its public offerings to conduct its principal operations. The Company will obtain the capital required to purchase real estate and real estate-related investments and conduct its operations from the proceeds of the Offerings, any future offerings, from secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from its operations. 
 If the Company is unable to raise substantial funds in its public offerings, it will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments it makes and the value of an investment in the Company will fluctuate with the performance of the limited assets it acquires. Further, the Company will have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a public company and a REIT, regardless of whether it is able to raise substantial funds in the offerings. The Company s inability to raise substantial funds would increase its fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing its net income and limiting its ability to make distributions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has raised gross proceeds of 480,864,288 in the Offerings. 
 64 

The Company uses debt financing as a source of capital. The Company s charter limits the Company from incurring debt if the Company s borrowings exceed 300 of the cost of the Company s net assets, which is estimated to approximate 75 of the cost of its tangible assets (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves), though the Company may exceed this limit under certain circumstances. Once the Company has fully deployed the proceeds of the Offerings, the Company expects its debt financing and other liabilities may likely be approximately 60 of the cost of its tangible assets (before adjusting for depreciation or other non-cash reserves), although it may exceed this level during the offering stage. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s debt to tangible assets ratio was 55 . See Note 8 Loans Payable of the Company s outstanding debt arrangement as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to making investments in accordance with its investment objectives, the Company uses its capital resources to make certain payments to the Advisor and Dealer Manager. In conjunction with the Offerings, payments are made to the Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, and distribution fee payments. With regards to the total organization and offering costs, including selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution fees and reimbursement of other organization and offering costs, will not exceed 15 of the gross proceeds of each Offering, including proceeds from sales of shares under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. Additionally, the Company expects to make payments to the Advisor in connection with the management of its assets and costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company. 
 The Company anticipates that over time adequate cash will be generated from operations to fund its operating and administrative expenses, continuing debt service obligations and the payment of distributions. However, the Company s ability to finance its operations is subject to some uncertainties. The Company s ability to generate working capital is dependent on its ability to attract and retain tenants, investments that generate cash flow, and the economic and business environments of the various markets in which the Company s properties will be located. The Company s ability to sell its assets is partially dependent upon the state of real estate markets and the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at reasonable commercial rates. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in the Company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 

Cash flows from operating activities 

21,093,712 

Cash flows from investing activities 

7,279,327 

Cash flows from financing activities 

(32,023,216) 

Decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

(3,650,177) 

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 21,093,712, compared to 11,720,096 net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in reimbursement of expenses due to related parties (see Results of Operations ). 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 7,279,327, compared to 6,303,409 net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase of 2,248,860 in capital improvements to real estate, an increase of 10,399,997 in proceeds from sale of investment in debt securities, and a decrease of 5,201,725 in purchase of investment in debt securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 32,023,216, compared to 3,782,559 net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to a net increase in proceeds from borrowings under credit facility of 2,000,000, a decrease in proceeds from common stock issued of 32,339,217, a decrease in distributions of 5,672,686, an increase in payments from redemptions of common stock of 8,729,163, a decrease in non-controlling interest distributions of 137,678, an increase in non-controlling interest contribution of 4,086,641 offset by an increase of 978,688 in deferred financing costs.

Distributions 
 The Company s board of directors has authorized, and the Company has declared, distributions for the period September 1, 2020 through November 1, 2024 in an amount equal to 0.004234973 per day (or approximately 1.55 on an annual basis) per each share of common stock and OP unit, less, for holders of certain classes of shares, the distribution fees that are payable with respect to such shares as further described in the applicable prospectus. The distributions are payable by the 5th business day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. 
 The amount of distributions payable to the Company s stockholders is determined by the board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, the Company s financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain its status as a REIT. The Company s board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time, and therefore distribution payments are not assured. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s distributions declared during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Election as a REIT 
 The Company has elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company intends to operate in such a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that the Company will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. In order to qualify and continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, the Company generally must distribute annually at least 90 of the Company s REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements, including asset, income, share ownership, minimum distribution and other requirements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the Company s principal operations. The Company considers these policies critical because they involve significant judgments and assumptions, and they require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and they are important for understanding and evaluating the Company s reported financial results. The accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgments in the application of such policies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in the Company s financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of the Company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 Reimbursement of Organization and Offering Costs 
 The Advisor has agreed to pay, on behalf of the Company, all O O Costs through the first anniversary of the date on which the Company satisfied the Minimum Offering Requirement, which was May 18, 2018 Escrow Break Anniversary ). The Company was not required to reimburse the Advisor for payment of the O O Costs prior to the Escrow Break Anniversary. After the Escrow Break Anniversary, the Advisor, in its sole discretion, may pay some or all of the additional O O Costs incurred, but is not required to do so. To the extent the Advisor pays such additional O O Costs, the Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor subject to the 1 Cap. Following the Escrow Break Anniversary, the Company began reimbursing the Advisor for payment of the O O Costs on a monthly basis, which will continue through the period ended May 18, 2021; provided, however, that the Company will not be obligated to pay any amounts that as a result of such payment would cause the aggregate payments for O O Costs (less selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution fees) paid to the Advisor to exceed the 1 Cap as of such payment date. Any amounts not reimbursed in any period are included in determining any reimbursement for a subsequent period. As of September 30, 2024, the Advisor has continued to pay all O O Costs on behalf of the Company. 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 A Variable Interest Entity VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. For an entity in which the Company has acquired an interest, the entity will be considered a VIE if both of the following characteristics are not met: 1) the equity investors in the entity have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) the equity investors total investment at risk is sufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company makes judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, then a quantitative analysis, if necessary. A qualitative analysis is generally based on a review of the design of the entity, including its control structure and decision-making abilities, and also its financial structure. In a quantitative analysis, the Company would incorporate various estimates, including estimated future cash flows, assumed hold periods and capitalization or discount rates. 
 If an entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company then determines whether to consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. 
 The Company evaluates all of its investments in real estate-related assets to determine if they are VIEs utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective. If different judgments or estimates were used for these evaluations, it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a VIE and whether or not to consolidate such entity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company concluded that it had investments in VIEs, and because the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary it consolidated such entities, as described in Note 11 Variable Interest Entities in its accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) and Supplementary Data. 
 67 

Voting Interest Entities 
 A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the Company has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is generally consolidated. The Company does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party. The Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation guidance, and vice versa. 
 Current Expected Credit Losses CECL 
 The Company presents its financial assets that are measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses, which represents the amount expected to be collected over their estimated life. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets carried at amortized cost, as well as changes to expected lifetime credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. The CECL methodology, which became effective for the Company on January 1, 2023, represents a significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple impairment methods, which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset in scope, the methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related allowance for credit losses than under prior U.S. GAAP. The CECL methodology s impact on expected credit losses, among other things, reflects the Company s view of the current state of the economy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and the Company s portfolios. 
 
 Accounting for Investments 
 Operating Real Estate 
 Operating real estate are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company follows the purchase method for an acquisition of operating real estate, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles. Major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
 Debt Investments 
 Debt investments are generally intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees, premium, discount and unfunded commitments. Debt investments that are deemed to be credit impaired are carried at amortized cost less a loan loss reserve, if deemed appropriate. Debt investments where the Company does not have the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff are classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, unless the Company has elected to apply the fair value option at origination or purchase. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Operating Real Estate 
 Rental and other income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. 
 Debt Investments 
 Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis along with any changes in the fair value. The changes in fair value are reflected as an adjustment to net gain from investment in debt securities in earnings. 
 68 

Income Taxes 
 The Company has elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the Company s income that is distributed annually to stockholders. The Company intends to operate in a manner that allows it to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The Company will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact the Company s REIT status. If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the Company s taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions paid to stockholders in any year in which it fails to qualify as a REIT. The Company would also be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless the Company was entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. 
 The Company provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from the Company s estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on other accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. 
 Inflation 
 Some of the Company s leases with tenants may contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). The Company may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, the Company s net leases will generally require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce the Company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table presents the future principal payment due under the Company s GR Loan, FM Loan, CO Loan, DST Loan, Buchanan Loan, Keller Loan, Summerfield Loan, Valencia Loan, Kacey Loan, Industry Loan, ON3 Loan, West End Loan, Palms Loan, Pearland Loan, WAG Portfolio Loan, and Credit Facility agreements as of September 30, 2024, which represents the Company s aggregate contractual obligations and commitments with payments due subsequent to September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk 
 The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. The Company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to manage overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. The Company would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there are no such hedging contracts outstanding. The Company does not have any foreign operations and thus is not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 443 million fixed rate debt and 143 million of floating rate debt. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit the exposure to interest rate changes associated with its borrowings. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its related parties may also have other financial relationships. The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. (For further detail refer to Note 8 Loans Payable). 
 Credit Risk 
 Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company is subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations. Any downturn of the economic conditions in one or more of these tenants, states or industries could result in a material reduction the Company s cash flows or material losses to the Company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, lease expirations related to the Company s net lease portfolio of real estate assets (excluding the SF Property), based on each asset s fair value used in determining the Company's NAV, were as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average lease term remaining of the Company s portfolio of real estate assets (excluding multifamily, mezzanine and preferred equity investments), based on each asset s fair value used in determining the Company's NAV, was 7.1 years. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average occupancy of the Company s portfolio of real estate assets, based on each asset s fair value used in determining the Company's NAV, was 96.5 . For the Company's industrial, retail and office investments, occupancy includes all leased square footage as of the date indicated. For the Company's multifamily investments, occupancy is defined as the percentage of units occupied on the date indicated. 
 The factors considered in determining the credit risk of the Company s tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. The credit risk of the Company s portfolio is reduced by the high quality of the Company s existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of the Company s portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 The Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 72 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 The Company has disclosed in Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (File No. 333-214130), filed with the SEC, risk factors which materially affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed, except as noted below. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that management currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 If the Company raises substantial proceeds from the Offerings in a short period of time, the Company may not be able to invest all of the Company s Follow-On Offering proceeds promptly, which may cause the Company s distributions and the Company s stockholders investment returns to be lower than they otherwise would be. 
 The more shares the Company sells in the Company s Offerings, the greater the Company s challenge will be to invest all of the proceeds. The large size of the Company's Offerings increases the risk of delays in investing the Company s net proceeds promptly and on attractive terms. Pending investment, the net proceeds of the Offerings may be invested in permitted temporary investments, which include short-term United States government securities, bank certificates of deposit and other short-term liquid investments. The rate of return on these investments, which affects the amount of cash available to make distributions to stockholders, has fluctuated in recent years and most likely will be less than the return obtainable from the type of investments in the real estate industry the Company seeks to acquire or originate. Therefore, delays the Company encounters in the selection, due diligence and acquisition or origination of investments would likely limit the Company s ability to pay distributions to the Company s stockholders and lower their overall returns. In addition, cash and cash equivalents may potentially subject the Company to concentration of risk and at times, balances with any one financial institution may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 27.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 If the Company pays cash distributions from sources other than the Company s cash flow from operations, the Company will have less funds available for investments and the Company s stockholders overall return may be reduced. 
 The Company s organizational documents do not restrict the Company from paying distributions from any source and do not restrict the amount of distributions the Company may pay from any source, including proceeds from the Offerings or the proceeds from the issuance of securities in the future, other third party borrowings, advances from the Advisor or CFI or from the Advisor s deferral or waiver of its fees under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. Distributions may also be funded at least in part, indirectly, due to: (i) organizational and offering expenses paid on the Company's behalf by the Company's advisor, which may be subject to reimbursement to the advisor or its affiliates, (ii) other expenses borne by the Company's advisor, that may be subject to reimbursement to the advisor, and (iii) the Company's advisor's ability to elect to receive a portion of its asset management fee in Class I shares or Class I operating partnership units, which may be repurchased at a later date. In addition, these factors may have a smoothing effect on the Company's NAV. It is anticipated that during the offering and acquisition phase, when building the Company's portfolio and before the properties have had an opportunity to appreciate, distributions are more likely to be funded at least partially with cash flows from financing activities determined on a GAAP basis, which may include, among other things, offering proceeds and borrowings. This distribution policy may not be a sustainable long-term policy. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits, particularly during the period before the Company has substantially invested the net proceeds from the Offerings, may constitute a return of capital for tax purposes. From time to time, particularly during the period before the Company has substantially invested the net proceeds from the Offerings, the Company may generate taxable income greater than the Company s income for financial reporting purposes, or the Company s taxable income may be greater than the Company s cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. In these situations the Company may make distributions in excess of the Company s cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement. In such an event, the Company would look first to other third party borrowings to fund these distributions. If the Company funds distributions from financings, the net proceeds from the Offerings or sources other than the Company s cash flow from operations, the Company will have less funds available for investment in income-producing commercial real estate and the Company s stockholders overall return may be reduced. In addition, if the aggregate amount of cash the Company distributes to stockholders in any given year exceeds the amount of the Company s taxable income generated during the year, 
 73 

the excess amount will either be (1) a return of capital or (2) a gain from the sale or exchange of property to the extent that a stockholder s basis in the Company s common stock equals or is reduced to zero as the result of the Company s current or prior year distributions. Such distributions may effectively dilute or reduce the value of the stockholders remaining interest in the Company s net asset value. 
 If the Company pays distributions from sources other than the Company s cash flow from operations, the Company will have less cash available for investments, the Company may have to reduce the Company s distribution rate, the Company s net asset value may be negatively impacted and the Company s stockholders overall return may be reduced. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has declared cumulative distributions of 90,317,034, of which 17 of the Company s cash distributions were paid using sources other than the cash flow from operations, including borrowings and proceeds from the Offerings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 100 of the Company's cash distributions were paid using sources from the Company's cash flow from operations (see Distributions ). 
 The Company s NAV per share may materially change if the valuations of the Company s properties materially change from prior valuation or the actual operating results materially differ from what the Company originally budgeted, including as a result of the Advisor invoicing the Company for previously unbilled operating expenses. 
 It is possible that the annual appraisals of the Company s properties may not be spread evenly throughout the year and may differ from the prior valuation utilized in the most recent prior valuation. As such, when these appraisals are reflected in the Company s Independent Valuation Firm s valuation of the Company s real estate portfolio, there may be a material change in the Company s NAV per share for each class of the Company s common stock. Property valuation changes can occur for a variety of reasons, such as local real estate market conditions, the financial condition of the Company s tenants, or lease expirations. For example, the Company will regularly face lease expirations across the Company s portfolio, and as the Company moves further away from lease commencement toward the end of a lease term, the valuation of the underlying property will be expected to drop depending on the likelihood of a renewal or a new lease on similar terms. Such a valuation drop can be particularly significant when closer to a lease expiration, especially for single tenant buildings or where an individual tenant occupies a large portion of a building. The Company is at the greatest risk of these valuation changes during periods in which the Company has a large number of lease expirations as well as when the lease of a significant tenant is closer to expiration. Similarly, if a tenant will have an option in the future to purchase one of the Company s properties from the Company at a price that is less than the current valuation of the property, then if the value of the property exceeds the option price, the valuation will be expected to decline and begin to approach the purchase price as the date of the option approaches. 
 In addition, actual operating results may differ from what the Company originally budgeted, which may cause a material increase or decrease in the NAV per share amounts. The Company accrues estimated income and expenses on a quarterly basis based on annual budgets as adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the business throughout the year. On a periodic basis, the Company adjusts the income and expense accruals the Company estimated to reflect the income and expenses actually earned and incurred. The Company will not retroactively adjust the NAV per share of each class for any adjustments. Therefore, because actual results from operations may be better or worse than what the Company previously budgeted, the adjustment to reflect actual operating results may cause the NAV per share for each class of the Company s common stock to increase or decrease. 
 The Company s Amended Advisory Agreement provides that any operating expenses which have not been invoiced by the Advisor will not become the Company s obligations. Without these provisions in the Company s Amended Advisory Agreement, such operating expenses, if invoiced, would likely be recorded as liabilities of the Company, which, in turn, would likely have a negative effect on the Company s NAV per share. The Company s Amended Advisory Agreement provides that the Advisor will not invoice the Company for any reimbursement if the impact of such would result in the incurrence of an obligation in an amount that would result in the Company s NAV per share for any class of shares to be less than 25.00. The Company may, however, incur and record an obligation to reimburse the Advisor, even if it would result in the Company s NAV per share for any class of shares for such quarter to be less than 25.00, if the Company s board of directors determines that the reasons for the decrease of the Company s NAV per share below 25.00 were unrelated to the Company s obligation to reimburse the Advisor for operating expenses. The Company s Amended Advisory Agreement also provides that the Advisor may be reimbursed for previously unbilled operating expenses for prior periods in any subsequent quarter, subject to certain limitations, including the limitation related to the NAV per share of 25.00 referenced above and the 2 /25 Guidelines. The incurrence of previously unbilled operating expenses likely will have a negative effect on the Company s NAV per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Advisor has incurred 17,035,903 of Unreimbursed Operating Expenses, including 2,376,696 of Unreimbursed Operating Expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have not been invoiced to the Company.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not complete any sales of unregistered securities. 
 Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Program 
 Stockholders are eligible to have their shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to the Third Amendment and Restated Share Repurchase Program Amended SRP ). 
 The Amended SRP included numerous restrictions that limit stockholders ability to have their shares repurchased. If repurchase requests, in the business judgment of the Company s board of directors, place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on stockholders whose shares are not repurchased, then the Company s board of directors may terminate, suspend or amend the share repurchase program at any time without stockholder approval, if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the stockholders. In addition, the Company s board of directors may determine to suspend the share repurchase program due to regulatory changes, changes in law or if the Company's board of directors becomes aware of undisclosed material information that it believes should be publicly disclosed before shares are repurchased. Material modifications, including any reduction to the monthly or quarterly limitations on repurchases, and suspensions of the program will be promptly disclosed to stockholders in a prospectus supplement (or post-effective amendment if required by the Securities Act) or current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Any material modifications will also be disclosed on the Company's website.
