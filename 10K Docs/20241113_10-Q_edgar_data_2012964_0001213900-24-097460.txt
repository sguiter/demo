CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial
position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, 
 may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, 
 expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking
statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our
financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial
needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in
 Risk Factors of our Prospectus dated July 31, 2024 and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC, as well as in any
documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected
in these forward-looking statements. 

Moreover,
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management
to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur
and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under
no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after completion of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements
to actual results or revised expectations.

. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, shares exchange, asset acquisition, shares purchase, reorganization,
or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of
interest income from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Financing 

The
Company s founder and sponsor is AA Mission Acquisition Sponsor Holdco LLC (the Sponsor ). The registration statement
for the Company s IPO was declared effective on July 31, 2024. On August 2, 2024, the Company consummated the IPO of 
units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public
Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of . 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement of units (the Initial Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, at a price of per Private Placement Unit,
generating total proceeds of . 

Transaction
costs amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee and 
of other offering costs. 

On
September 4, 2024, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional Units.
As a result, the Company sold an additional Units at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of .
Simultaneously with the closing of the full exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 
Private Placement Units, at a purchase price of per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of . 

From
sale of over-allotment Units, the transaction costs incurred amounted to for cash underwriting commission. These costs were
charged to additional paid-in capital or accumulated deficit to the extent additional paid-in capital is fully depleted upon completion
of the IPO. 

Business
Combination 

The
Company will have until 18 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 24 months from the closing of the IPO if the Company extends
the period of time to consummate a Business Combination by the full amount of time), or August 2, 2026, (the Combination Period ).
However, if the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem
the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including
interest (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number
of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of its remaining shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve,
subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to its public rights or private placement rights, which
will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the 18-month time period, and the Company
may extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (or up to 24 months
from the closing of the IPO if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination by the full amount of time).

and a working capital of . The Company has incurred and expects to continue
to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit
of the consummation of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period,
the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company.
There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we intend
to focus our search on businesses in Asia, we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating
an initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private units, the proceeds
of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and
debt. We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange,
asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly,

and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering IPO ). Following the IPO, we will not generate
any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form
of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after the IPO. After the IPO, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being
a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence
on prospective business combination candidates. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have a net income of 2,230,484 which consists of loss of 339,668 derived from operating
costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 2,567,083. 

For
the period from February 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,105,103, which consists of loss of
 465,049 derived from formation and operating costs offset by income earned on Trust Account of 2,567,083. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
August 2, 2024, we consummated our IPO of Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 300,000,000. Simultaneously with the
closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 759,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private
placement to the Sponsors, generating total gross proceeds of 7,590,000. 

On
September 4, 2024, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full to purchase 4,500,000 Units. As a result, we sold an
additional 4,500,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 45,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the full
exercise of the over-allotment option, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 90,000 Private Placement Units, at a purchase
price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of 900,000. 

Transaction
costs amounted to 14,634,758, consisting of 5,175,000 of cash underwriting fee, 8,625,000 of deferred underwriting fee and 834,758
of other offering costs. 

Following
the closing of the IPO and over-allotment option, an amount of 346,725,000 10.05 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
Units in the IPO and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account. The funds held in the Trust Account may be invested in U.S.
government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account,
including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, to complete our initial business combination. To the extent
that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining
proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make
other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

2 

Prior
to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the approximately 576,344 of proceeds held outside
the trust account. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective
target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives
or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business
combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes. 

We
expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately 300,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence,
travel and other expenses in connection with any business combinations; 150,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory
reporting requirements; 50,000 for NYSE continued listing fees; 100,000 of fees pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement for
office space, administrative, financial and support services; 200,000 for directors and officers insurance and 10,000
for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves, net of estimated interest income. 

These
amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. If our available funds are not sufficient, we may be unable
to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following the offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating
an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate
our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial
business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial
business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination.

March 19, 2024, the Sponsors received 8,625,000 of the Company s Class B ordinary shares Founder Shares in

The
Sponsors have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur

Promissory
Note Related Party 

The
Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note ), pursuant to which the Company may borrow
up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December
31, 2024, or (ii) the consummation of the IPO. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Promissory Note. 

Due
to Related Party 

The
Sponsor paid certain formation, operating or deferred offering costs on behalf of the Company. These amounts are due on demand and non-interest
bearing. During the period from February 9, 2024 (inception) to September 30, 2024, the Sponsor paid 539,874 on behalf of the Company,
of which 25,000 was paid in exchange for the issuance of Founder Shares. As of September 30, 2024, the amount due to the related party

Administrative
Services Agreement 

The
Company entered into an agreement, commencing on the effective date of the IPO through the earlier of the Company s consummation
of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of up to 10,000 per month for office space
and administrative and support services. An administration fee of 20,000 was recorded and paid for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and for the period from February 9, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024. 

Working
Capital Loans 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor
or certain of the Company s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working
Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company will repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds
of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the
Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust
Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans.
Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent Units at
a price of 10.00 per Unit at the option of the lender. Such Units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms
of such Working Capital Loans by our Sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of September 30, 2024, no Working Capital Loans were outstanding. 

Other
Contractual Obligations 

Registration
Rights 

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement dated on the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on July 31, 2024, the holders of the Founder
Shares, Private Placement Units (including securities contained therein), and units (including securities contained therein) that may
be issued on conversion of working capital loans or extension loans (and) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration

In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent
to the Company completion of initial business combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration

Underwriting
Agreement 

The
Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments at the IPO
price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. 

The
underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 0.15 per Unit, or 4,500,000 in the aggregate (or 5,175,000 if the underwriters 
over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the IPO In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred
fee of 0.25 per Unit, or 7,500,000 in the aggregate (or 8,625,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters over-allotment option
is exercised in full). 

On
September 4, 2024, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full to purchase 4,500,000 Units. As a result, the Company
sold an additional 4,500,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 45,000,000. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies or estimates. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS
Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify
as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such
standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls
over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure
that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose
certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of
the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the
completion of this offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

Recent

does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our financial statements.
