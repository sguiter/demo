 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLID ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS) 
 The consolidated financial statements include all of the Company s majority-owned subsidiaries. All entities acquired, and any entity of which a majority interest was acquired, are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. The consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, accordingly, they do not include all of the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of results of operations, financial position and cash flow activity required by GAAP for complete financial statements but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments including those of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the interim results presented. As previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of the Company s centralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management s 2024 strategic planning process, the Company s reportable segments changed to one segment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. Since the Company operates in operating segment and reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company identified and recorded an out-of-period adjustment related to an income tax error. The impact of correcting this error, which was immaterial to all current and prior period financial statements and corrected in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, resulted in an income tax expense of approximately , with a corresponding decrease to net income, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 filed on February 28, 2024, which includes additional information about the Company, its results of operations, its financial position and its cash flows.

The Company s long-term deferred revenue, which is included in other liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets, represents revenue that will not be recognized during the next 12 months and is generally related to upfront payments received as an inducement for entering into certain sales-based royalty agreements with third-party licensees.

Change in Goodwill Reporting Units As discussed in Note 1, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of the Company s centralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management s 2024 strategic planning process, the Company s reportable segments changed to segment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. In connection with the Company s change to one reportable segment, the Company s operating segments also changed to segment. As a result of this change to the Company s operating segments, the Company reassessed its reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), the Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results of the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. Prior to the change in operating segments, the Company s reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill were determined by country. Component level financial information is reviewed by management across two business lines: Behavioral and Clinical. The Company s Behavioral business line consists of the Company s Workshops + Digital business and Digital business. Accordingly, these were determined to be the Company's new reporting units as of the first day of fiscal 2024. This change in reporting units qualified as a triggering event and required goodwill to be tested for impairment. As required by ASC 350, the Company tested goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the change in reporting units. As a result of these impairment analyses, it was determined that goodwill was not impaired before or after the change in reporting units. Franchise Rights Acquired Finite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than . Indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired are tested for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. In performing the impairment analysis for indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for franchise rights acquired is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for franchise rights related to the Company s Workshops + Digital business and a relief from royalty methodology for franchise rights related to the Company s Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these franchise rights is then compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for these rights. The Company has determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net book value of franchise rights acquired for the United States unit of account as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date was . In its hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the Company assumed that the year of maturity was reached after years. Subsequent to the year of maturity, the Company estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating income margins. In the Company s relief from royalty approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital and the Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.

WW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS) 

 and , respectively. In performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, for all of the Company s reporting units, the Company estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to each of the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units and then applied expected future operating income growth rates for the respective reporting unit. The Company utilized operating income as the basis for measuring its potential growth because it believes it is the best indicator of the performance of its business. The Company then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Interim Impairment Tests During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, the Company identified various qualitative and quantitative factors which collectively indicated a triggering event had occurred. These factors included the continued decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, and actual business performance. As a result of this triggering event, the Company performed interim impairment tests for all of its franchise rights acquired units of account and goodwill reporting units in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. In performing the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of September 28, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying values of its United States and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment charges for its United States and United Kingdom units of account of and (which comprised the remaining balance of franchise rights acquired for the United Kingdom unit of account), respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. These impairments were driven primarily by the weighted average cost of capital used in this interim impairment test, reflecting market factors, including higher interest rates and the trading values of the Company s equity and debt, and, to a lesser extent, business performance. Based on the results of the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company s United States unit of account, which held of the Company s indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account was equal to its respective carrying value. Accordingly, a change in the underlying assumptions for the United States unit of account may change the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in further impairment of the franchise rights acquired related to the United States, for which the net book value was as of September 28, 2024. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company s Behavioral reporting unit, which held of the Company s goodwill as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date, there was significant headroom in the goodwill impairment test for this unit with the difference between the fair value and the carrying value exceeding and, therefore, impairment existed. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company s Clinical reporting unit, which held of the Company s goodwill as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit was at least higher than the respective unit's carrying value and, therefore, impairment existed. Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Annual Impairment Tests The Company reviews indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. The Company performed its annual fair value impairment testing as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, each the first day of fiscal May, on its indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill. In performing the annual impairment analyses as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, the Company determined that the carrying values of its franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account and goodwill reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values and, therefore, impairment existed. Based on the results of the Company s May 5, 2024 annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for its United States and United Kingdom units of account, each unit of account had an estimated fair value at least higher than the respective unit's carrying value and, therefore, impairment existed.

 higher than the respective unit s carrying value and, therefore, no impairment existed. First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Interim Impairment Tests During the quarter ended March 30, 2024, the Company identified various qualitative and quantitative factors which collectively indicated a triggering event had occurred. These factors included the continued decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization, and actual business performance. As a result of this triggering event, the Company performed interim impairment tests for all of its franchise rights acquired units of account and goodwill reporting units in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In performing the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of March 30, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying values of its United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, the Company recorded impairment charges for its United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account of , (which comprised the remaining balance of franchise rights acquired for the Australia unit of account), (which comprised the remaining balance of franchise rights acquired for the New Zealand unit of account) and , respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These impairments were driven primarily by the weighted average cost of capital used in this interim impairment test, reflecting market factors, including higher interest rates and the trading values of the Company s equity and debt, and, to a lesser extent, business performance. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of March 30, 2024 performed for all of the Company s reporting units, each unit had an estimated fair value at least higher than the respective unit s carrying value and, therefore, no impairment existed.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, in connection with its refinancing of its then-existing credit facilities, the Company incurred approximately in an aggregate principal amount of borrowings under its new credit facilities (as amended from time to time, the Credit Facilities and issued in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Senior Secured Notes ), each as described in further detail below. Credit Facilities	 The Credit Facilities were issued under a credit agreement, dated April 13, 2021 (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ), among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. Bank of America ), as administrative agent and an issuing bank. The Credit Facilities consist of (1) in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B term loans due in (the Term Loan Facility and (2) in an aggregate principal amount of commitments under a senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit) due in (the Revolving Credit Facility ). As of September 28, 2024, the Company had in an aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities, w ith of availability and in issued but undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to its terms and conditions as discussed below. There were outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Company s current and future wholly-owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including: a pledge of of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the Company or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than of the voting stock of such first-tier non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and 

 a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. 

 The Credit Facilities require the Company to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (which percentage will be reduced to and if the Company attains certain first lien secured net leverage ratios) of the Company s annual excess cash flow; 

 of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and condemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest of such proceeds, subject to certain qualifications; and

 of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement. 

 The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal on the Term Loan Facility. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without penalty, except for customary breakage costs with respect to Term SOFR loans under the Credit Facilities. In June 2023, in connection with the planned phase-out of LIBOR, the Company amended its Credit Facilities to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark rate under the Credit Agreement, which is calculated to include a credit spread adjustment of , , , or for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months period, respectively, in addition to the Term SOFR Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the margin (which was not amended). Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus ; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of or (2) an applicable margin plus a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided that Term SOFR is not lower than a floor of . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at the Company s option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus ; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of or (2) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided such rate is not lower than a floor of . As of September 28, 2024, the applicable margins for the Term SOFR rate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were and , res pectively. On a quarterly basis, the Company pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of unutilized commitments thereunder, which commitment fee fluctuates depending upon the Company s Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt, amendments of material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, changes to lines of business and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions are also subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, if the aggregate principal amount of extensions of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of any fiscal quarter end exceeds of the amount of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect on such date, the Company must be in compliance with a Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio of :1.00 for the period ending after the first fiscal quarter of 2024 through and including the first fiscal quarter of 2025, with a step down to :1.00 for the period f ollowing the first fiscal quarter of 2025.

The Company was not in compliance with the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio as of September 28, 2024 , and as a result, the Company is limited to borrowing no more than , or , of the amount of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of each fiscal quarter end until the Company complies with the applicable ratio. Senior Secured Notes The Senior Secured Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the Indenture ), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee and notes collateral agent. The Indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities.

If a change of control occurs, the Company must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. Following the sale of certain assets and subject to certain conditions, the Company must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company s subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes and the note guarantees are secured by a first-priority lien on all the collateral that secures the Credit Facilities, subject to a shared lien of equal priority with the Company s and each guarantor s obligations under the Credit Facilities and subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens. Outstanding Debt At September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes, consisting of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of , drawn down on the Revolving Credit Facility and in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes issued and outstanding. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company s debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate instruments. The Company has historically entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flow exposure associated with the Company s variable-rate borrowings. At September 28, 2024 , the Company did not have any interest rate swaps in effect. See Note 11 for further information on the Company s use of interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on the Company s outstanding debt, exclusive of the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately and per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates. The weighted average interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on the Company s outstanding debt, including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately and per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates. Liquidity The Company s sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and availability under its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company s primary cash needs are funding its operations and global strategic initiatives, meeting debt service requirements and engaging in selective acquisitions. The Company s recent financial results have been, and its future financial results may be, negatively impacted by financial, business, economic, demographic and other factors, such as the increased popularity and acceptance of weight management medications, attitudes towards weight management and wellness programs and competition. The Company s ability to continue to meet its obligations is dependent on its ability to generate positive cash flow. In the event that the Company is unable to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness before maturity, seek waivers of or amendments to contractual obligations for payment, reduce or delay strategic investments and capital expenditures, sell material assets or seek other financing opportunities. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient liquidity, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, results of operation and financial condition.

 and , respectively, compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for interim periods is determined using an annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which included an increase in valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, in relation to the Company s forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the unusually high negative annual effective tax rate. Applying this negative annual effective tax rate to pretax loss for the three months ended September 28, 2024 resulted in an income tax benefit and applying this negative annual effective tax rate to the pretax loss for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 resulted in an income tax expense. In addition, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , the effective tax rate was impacted by approximately of tax expense recorded for an out-of-period income tax adjustment and of tax expense from a valuation allowance established to offset certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a global minimum tax of applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on the Company s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the Company s consolidated effective tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by a tax benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income. Non-Income Tax Matters The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS notified the Company of certain penalties assessed related to the annual disclosure and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The Company appealed this determination, and in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the penalties were fully abated and the federal tax lien maintained by the IRS during the appeals process was lifted.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 To supplement our consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, operating (loss) income margin and components thereof are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for our franchise rights acquired related to our United States and United Kingdom units of account, (y) the net impact of (a) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2024 restructuring plan (the 2024 plan ), (b) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the 2023 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2023 plan, as applicable and (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the 2022 plan ), and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of our former Chief Executive Officer CEO (ii) the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for our franchise rights acquired related to our United States, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account, (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2024 plan, the 2023 plan and the 2022 plan, and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of our former CEO; (iii) the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to exclude the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan; and (iv) the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the 2021 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the 2020 plan ), and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. We generally refer to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, the impact of acquisition transaction costs, and the impact of former CEO separation expenses, as applicable. We also present within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation EBITDAS earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs, and former CEO separation expenses Adjusted EBITDAS total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. See Liquidity and Capital Resources EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure in each case. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the performance of our business and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 USE OF CONSTANT CURRENCY 
 As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe in certain cases the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding or adjusting for the impact of foreign currency or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered in isolation. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Franchise Rights Acquired 
 Finite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired are tested for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. 
 30 

In performing the impairment analysis for indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for franchise rights acquired is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for franchise rights related to our Workshops + Digital business and a relief from royalty methodology for franchise rights related to our Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these franchise rights is then compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for these rights. We have determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net book value of franchise rights acquired for the United States unit of account as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date was 68.6 million. 
 In our hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2024, we assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the year of maturity, we estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating income margins. In our relief from royalty approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital and the Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt. 
 Goodwill 
 In performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. This approach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have determined the appropriate reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment to be the Behavioral and Clinical business lines. Our Behavioral business line consists of our Workshops + Digital business and Digital business. The net book values of goodwill for the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date were 153.0 million and 89.7 million, respectively. 
 In performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, for all of our reporting units, we estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to each of the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units and then applied expected future operating income growth rates for the respective reporting unit. We utilized operating income as the basis for measuring our potential growth because we believe it is the best indicator of the performance of our business. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt. 
 Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Impairment Tests 
 We review indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We performed our annual fair value impairment testing as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, each the first day of fiscal May, on our indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill. In addition, based on triggering events, we performed interim impairment tests as of March 30, 2024 and September 28, 2024 on our indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. 
 When determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, revenue growth rates, operating income margins and discount rates. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the impairment assessments and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the carrying values and result in an impairment of those assets. In the event such a result occurred, we would be required to record a corresponding charge, which would impact earnings. We would also be required to reduce the carrying values of the related assets on our balance sheet. We continue to evaluate these assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate. 
 In performing our impairment analyses, we also considered the trading value of both our equity and debt. If the trading values of both our equity and debt were to significantly decline from their levels at the time of testing, we may have to take an impairment charge at the appropriate time, which could be material. For additional information on risks associated with our recognizing asset impairment charges, see the risk factor titled We have in the past and may in the future be required to recognize asset impairment charges for indefinite- and definite-lived assets found in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023. 
 Further information regarding the results of our franchise rights acquired and goodwill annual impairment tests and our franchise rights acquired and goodwill interim impairment tests for the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024 can be found in Note 6 Franchise Rights Acquired, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Information concerning our critical accounting policies is set forth in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023. Our critical accounting policies have not changed since the end of fiscal 2023. 
 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
 Our management team regularly reviews and analyzes a number of financial and operating metrics, including the key performance indicators listed below, in order to manage our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We also believe that these key performance indicators are useful to both management and investors for forecasting purposes and to facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results. These metrics are supplemental to our GAAP results and include operational measures. 
 Revenues Our Subscription Revenues consist of Digital Subscription Revenues , Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues and Clinical Subscription Revenues . Digital Subscription Revenues consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings. Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for combined workshops and Digital offerings. Clinical Subscription Revenues consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for combined Clinical and Digital offerings. In addition, Other Revenues (formerly known as product sales and other consist of revenues from licensing and publishing, franchise fees with respect to commitment plans and royalties, and other revenues. Prior to fiscal 2024, Other Revenues included sales of consumer products. 

Paid Weeks The Paid Weeks metric reports paid weeks by WW customers in Company-owned operations for a given period as follows: (i) Digital Paid Weeks is the total paid subscription weeks for our Digital offerings; (ii) Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks is the total paid subscription weeks for combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) Clinical Paid Weeks is the total paid subscription weeks for combined Clinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) Total Paid Weeks is the sum of Digital Paid Weeks, Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks and Clinical Paid Weeks. 

Incoming Subscribers Subscribers refer to Digital subscribers, Workshops + Digital subscribers and Clinical subscribers who participate in recurring bill programs in Company-owned operations. The Incoming Subscribers metric reports Subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period start as follows: (i) Incoming Digital Subscribers is the total number of Digital subscribers; (ii) Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) Incoming Clinical Subscribers is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined Clinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) Incoming Subscribers is the sum of Incoming Digital Subscribers, Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers and Incoming Clinical Subscribers, as applicable. Given we completed our acquisition of Sequence in April 2023 after the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we have incoming subscribers with respect to our Clinical business for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024 and for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, but not for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric. 

End of Period Subscribers The End of Period Subscribers metric reports Subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period end as follows: (i) End of Period Digital Subscribers is the total number of Digital subscribers; (ii) End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) End of Period Clinical Subscribers is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined Clinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) End of Period Subscribers is the sum of End of Period Digital Subscribers, End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers and End of Period Clinical Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric.

Consolidated Results 
 Revenues 
 Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 192.9 million, a decrease of 22.0 million, or 10.2 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by 0.7 million, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 10.6 versus the prior year period. This decrease was driven by both the decline in Subscription Revenues and the decline in Other Revenues. The decline in Subscription Revenues was primarily due to recruitment declines during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period and the lower number of non-Clinical Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business and a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods. Subscription Revenues benefited from an increase in Clinical Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period. The decline in Other Revenues was primarily due to the discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. See Operating Results for additional details on revenues. 
 34 

Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 9.7 million, or 13.3 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by 0.1 million, cost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 13.5 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 3.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 0.4 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, cost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 18.1 , or 18.2 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 12.3 million, or 8.6 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by 0.6 million, gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 9.1 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 3.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 0.4 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 6.2 , or 6.6 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 67.1 , both as reported and on a constant currency basis, versus 66.0 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased to 69.1 , both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This gross margin increase was driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. 
 Marketing 
 Marketing expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 3.7 million, or 7.7 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which decreased marketing expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by 0.1 million, marketing expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 7.5 versus the prior year period. This decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to the strategic decision to reduce investment in the quarter given the rise in customer acquisition costs. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 23.0 from 22.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 4.1 million, or 6.4 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by 0.1 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased 6.3 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 10.0 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of the 3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 5.6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 7.3 , or 7.4 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 34.8 from 29.3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased by 0.9 , both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. 
 Impairments 
 In performing our interim impairment analysis as of September 28, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded impairment charges for our United States and United Kingdom units of account of 54.3 million and 2.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 35 

Operating (Loss) Income 
 Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 39.0 million compared to operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 30.6 million. Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by 0.5 million of foreign currency. Excluding the impact of the 57.0 million of franchise rights acquired impairments in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the 13.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of the 3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 6.0 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, operating income would have been 35.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of 36.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a decrease of 2.5 , or 4.2 on a constant currency basis. Operating loss margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 20.2 compared to operating income margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 14.2 . Excluding the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, operating income margin would have been 18.5 , or 18.2 on a constant currency basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income margin of 17.0 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year period. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 4.1 million, or 16.8 , versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in the base rate of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and excluding the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, increased to 7.75 per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 7.73 per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Interest expense was impacted by the termination of our interest rate swaps on March 31, 2024. Including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023, increased to 7.75 per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 6.75 per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Long-Term Debt for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. Further information regarding our use of interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net, which consists primarily of the negative impact of foreign currency on intercompany transactions, increased by 5.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to 5.9 million of expense as compared to 0.8 million of expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Tax 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 37.2 compared to (727.7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for interim periods is determined using an annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which included an increase in valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, in relation to our forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the unusually high negative annual effective tax rate. Applying this negative annual effective tax rate to pretax loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted in an income tax benefit. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a global minimum tax of 15 applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our consolidated effective tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by a tax benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income FDII ). 
 Net (Loss) Income and Diluted (Net Loss) Earnings Per Share 
 Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 46.2 million compared to net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 43.7 million. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by 0.3 million of foreign currency. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included a 51.8 million impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a 10.4 million net impact from restructuring charges and a 2.9 million impact from former CEO separation expenses. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 included a 4.5 million net impact from restructuring charges. 
 36 

Diluted net loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 0.58 compared to earnings per fully diluted share EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 0.54. Diluted net loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included a 0.65 impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a 0.13 net impact from restructuring charges and a 0.04 impact from former CEO separation expenses. EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 included a 0.06 net impact from restructuring charges. 
 Operating Results 
 As previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of our centralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management s 2024 strategic planning process, our reportable segments changed to one segment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance.

Operating Performance 
 The decrease in revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by both a decrease in Subscription Revenues and a decrease in Other Revenues. The decrease in Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by a decrease in Digital Subscription Revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues primarily due to recruitment declines during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period and the lower number of Incoming Digital Subscribers and Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In addition, the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business and a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods contributed to the decrease in Digital and Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues in the quarter. Subscription Revenues benefited from an increase in Clinical Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period, despite the recruitment challenges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 arising from the increasingly competitive environment. 
 The decrease in Other Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by the discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. 
 The decrease in Total Paid Weeks for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by recruitment declines during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period and the lower number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Consolidated Results 
 Revenues 
 Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were 601.5 million, a decrease of 82.1 million, or 12.0 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by 0.8 million, revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 12.1 versus the prior year period. This decrease was driven primarily by the decline in Other Revenues from the discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. Lower Subscription Revenues, primarily due to a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods and non-Clinical recruitment declines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period, also contributed to the decrease in revenues in the period. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business. Subscription Revenues included 57.5 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus 17.6 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 as a result of our acquisition of Sequence closing during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. See Operating Results for additional details on revenues. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased 82.2 million, or 29.5 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased cost of revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by 0.2 million, cost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 29.5 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 6.2 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 19.7 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, cost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 26.5 , or 26.6 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 0.1 million, or 0.0 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted gross profit in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by 0.7 million, gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 0.1 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 6.2 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the 19.7 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 3.1 , or 3.3 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 67.3 , or 67.2 on a constant currency basis, versus 59.2 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have increased 6.2 to 68.3 , both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This gross margin increase was driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. 
 Marketing 
 Marketing expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 0.8 million, or 0.4 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Foreign currency had a de minimis impact on marketing expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to higher spend on online advertising, partially offset by lower spend on TV advertising and production fees and agency fees. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 31.3 from 27.4 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 41 

Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased 14.9 million, or 7.9 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by 0.1 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 8.0 versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the 15.3 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the 3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the 11.6 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of the 8.6 million of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 8.2 , or 8.3 on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 28.9 from 27.6 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have increased by 1.1 , both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. 
 Impairments 
 In performing our interim impairment analysis as of September 28, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded impairment charges for our United States and United Kingdom units of account of 54.3 million and 2.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 In performing our interim impairment analysis as of March 30, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded impairment charges for our United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account of 251.4 million, 4.1 million, 2.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Operating (Loss) Income 
 Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 272.4 million compared to operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 28.3 million. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by 0.4 million of foreign currency. Excluding the impact of the 315.0 million of franchise rights acquired impairments in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the 21.5 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of the 3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the 31.3 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of the 8.6 million of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, operating income would have been 68.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of 68.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, a decrease of 0.4 , or 1.1 on a constant currency basis. Operating loss margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 45.3 compared to operating income margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 4.1 . Excluding the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, operating income margin would have been 11.3 , or 11.2 on a constant currency basis, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus operating income margin of 10.0 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year period. 
 42 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 10.5 million, or 14.7 , versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in the base rate of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and excluding the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, increased to 7.76 per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 7.48 per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Interest expense was impacted by the termination of our interest rate swaps on March 31, 2024. Including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the first nine months of fiscal 2023, increased to 7.44 per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 6.62 per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Long-Term Debt for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. Further information regarding our use of interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 Other expense (income), net, which consists primarily of the negative impact of foreign currency on intercompany transactions, changed by 4.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to 4.2 million of expense as compared to 36 thousand of income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 Tax 
 Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was (3.4 compared to 44.0 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for interim periods is determined using an annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which included an increase in valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, in relation to our forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the unusually high negative annual effective tax rate. Applying this negative annual effective tax rate to the pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 resulted in an income tax expense. In addition, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense recorded for an out-of-period income tax adjustment and tax expense from a valuation allowance established to offset certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a global minimum tax of 15 applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our consolidated effective tax rate was primarily due to the valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by a tax benefit related to FDII. 
 Net Loss and Diluted Net Loss Per Share 
 Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 370.8 million compared to the net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 24.1 million. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by 0.3 million of foreign currency. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included a 293.2 million impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a 16.1 million net impact from restructuring charges and a 2.9 million impact from former CEO separation expenses. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 included a 23.5 million net impact from restructuring charges and a 7.5 million impact from acquisition transaction costs. 
 Diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 4.67 compared to diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 0.32. Diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included a 3.69 impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a 0.20 net impact from restructuring charges and a 0.04 impact from former CEO separation expenses. Diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 included a 0.31 net impact from restructuring charges and a 0.10 impact from acquisition transaction costs. 
 Operating Results 
 As previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of our centralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management s 2024 strategic planning process, our reportable segments changed to one segment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance.

 Operating Performance 
 The decrease in revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by a decrease in Other Revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in Subscription Revenues. The decrease in Other Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by the discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. 
 The decrease in Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by both a decrease in Digital Subscription Revenues and a decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues due to a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods and recruitment declines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Digital Subscription Revenues and Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues were also negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business. In addition, the lower number of Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of fiscal 2023 contributed to the decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues in the period. Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 benefited from Clinical Subscription Revenues following our acquisition of Sequence during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, despite the recruitment challenges in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024 arising from the increasingly competitive environment.

The decrease in Total Paid Weeks for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by non-Clinical recruitment declines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with our primary source of liquidity. We have used these cash flows, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund our operations and global strategic initiatives, pay down debt and engage in selective acquisitions. Upon the completion of our acquisition of Sequence (the Acquisition ), in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 , we had a net cash outlay of 40.3 million on April 10, 2023 with respect to the payment of the purchase price and certain transaction costs . For additional details on the purchase price consideration for the Acquisition and related terms, including with respect to the first anniversary payment, see Note 5 Acquisitions in t he notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . These cash outlays have reduced the liquidity available to us in the future. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Acquisition of Weekend Health, Inc. (d/b/a Sequence) The Acquisition may not achieve its intended results. and Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Liquidity We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and satisfy our other liquidity requirements. contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 for additional details. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, our cash on hand of approximately 57.2 million at September 28, 2024, our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined and described below) at September 28, 2024 and our continued cost focus will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the short- and long-term. See Note 7 Long-Term Debt Liquidity in t he notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our liquidity. In addition, if necessary, we have the flexibility to delay investments or reduce marketing spend. 
 We continue to proactively manage our liquidity so we can maintain flexibility to fund investments in our business, honor our long-term debt obligations, and respond to evolving business and consumer conditions. To increase our flexibility and reduce our cash interest payments, we refinanced our then-existing credit facilities and then-existing senior notes in April 2021. Additionally, we instituted a number of measures throughout our operations to mitigate expenses and reduce costs as well as ensure liquidity. For example, restructuring plans instituted in recent fiscal years, and most recently in July 2024, have resulted in aggregate cash outlays of approximately 24.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and are expected to result in an additional 3.3 million for the remainder of fiscal 2024. For additional details, see Note 15 Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The evolving nature, and uncertain economic impact, of the current demand environment may impact our liquidity going forward. To the extent that we do not successfully manage our costs, our liquidity and financial results, as well as our ability to fully access our Revolving Credit Facility, may be adversely affected. Pursuant to their respective terms, our interest rate swaps were terminated on March 31, 2024. Given subsequent market conditions, management determined to not enter into any new swap arrangement since March 31, 2024. Management continues to evaluate its exposure to interest rates and, from time to time, may opportunistically hedge any interest rate exposure by entering into new swap arrangements. 
 As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes and borrowings under the Credit Facilities (each as defined below). Such transactions could be privately negotiated or open market transactions, pursuant to tender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing, or terms of, our indebtedness, any such purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet, the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, the issuance of our equity or the sale of assets. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may equate to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, which may reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series.

 The decrease in operational liabilities and other, net of assets, which includes accrued salaries and wages, was driven primarily by a decrease in accrued liabilities due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs and a decline in accrued marketing costs. The increase in accrued interest was due to the timing of payments. The decrease in prepaid income taxes was primarily due to the outsized impact of a significant, largely non-cash, income tax expense resulting from the valuation allowance recorded to reflect the uncertainty of the realization of U.S. deferred tax assets.

Operating Activities 
 Cash flows used for operating activities of 21.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 reflected an increase of 20.3 million from 1.2 million of cash flows used for operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase in cash flows used for operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss, partially offset by an increase in non-cash add-back adjustments driven by the franchise rights acquired impairments and an increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities totaled 13.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a decrease of 53.5 million as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in capitalized software and website development expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities totaled 17.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase of 15.2 million as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period.

Long-Term Debt 
 We currently plan to meet our long-term debt obligations by using cash flows provided by operating activities and opportunistically using other means to repay or refinance our obligations as we determine appropriate.

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, in connection with our refinancing of our then-existing credit facilities, we incurred approximately 1,000.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our new credit facilities (as amended from time to time, the Credit Facilities and issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.500 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Senior Secured Notes ), each as described in further detail below. 
 Credit Facilities 
 The Credit Facilities were issued under a credit agreement, dated April 13, 2021 (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ), among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. Bank of America ), as administrative agent and an issuing bank. The Credit Facilities consist of (1) 1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B term loans due in 2028 (the Term Loan Facility and (2) 175.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of commitments under a senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit) due in 2026 (the Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 945.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under our Credit Facilities, with 173.8 million of availability and 1.2 million in issued but undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to its terms and conditions as discussed below. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024. 
 All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of our current and future wholly-owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including: 
 a pledge of 100 of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the Company or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than 65 of the voting stock of such first-tier non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and 

a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. 

The Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: 
 50 (which percentage will be reduced to 25 and 0 if we attain certain first lien secured net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow; 

100 of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and our restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and condemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest 100 of such proceeds, subject to certain qualifications; and 

100 of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of our restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement. 

47 

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal on the Term Loan Facility. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without penalty, except for customary breakage costs with respect to Term SOFR loans under the Credit Facilities. 
 In June 2023, in connection with the planned phase-out of LIBOR, we amended our Credit Facilities to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark rate under the Credit Agreement, which is calculated to include a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448 , 0.26161 , 0.42826 , or 0.71513 for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months period, respectively, in addition to the Term SOFR Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the margin (which was not amended). 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 ; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.50 or (2) an applicable margin plus a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided that Term SOFR is not lower than a floor of 0.50 . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00 ; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.00 or (2) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided such rate is not lower than a floor of zero. As of September 28, 2024, the applicable margins for the Term SOFR rate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were 3.50 and 2.75 , respectively. 
 On a quarterly basis, we pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of unutilized commitments thereunder, which commitment fee fluctuates depending upon our Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 The Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt, amendments of material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, changes to lines of business and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement that were in effect on such date. 
 The availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions are also subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, if the aggregate principal amount of extensions of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of any fiscal quarter end exceeds 35 of the amount of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect on such date, we must be in compliance with a Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio of 5.25:1.00 for the period ending after the first fiscal quarter of 2024 through and including the first fiscal quarter of 2025, with a step down to 5.00:1.00, for the period following the first fiscal quarter of 2025. As of September 28, 2024, our actual Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio was 8.88:1.00 and there were no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and total letters of credit issued were 1.2 million. We were not in compliance with the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio as of September 28, 2024, and as a result, we are limited to borrowing no more than 35 , or 61.3 million, of the amount of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of each fiscal quarter end until we comply with the applicable ratio. 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 The Senior Secured Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 13, 2021 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the Indenture ), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee and notes collateral agent. The Indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities. These covenants include limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Indenture that were in effect on such date. 
 48 

The Senior Secured Notes accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 4.500 and will mature on April 15, 2029. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. Commencing April 15, 2024, we may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 102.250 of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, such optional redemption price decreasing to 101.125 on or after April 15, 2025 and to 100.000 on or after April 15, 2026. If a change of control occurs, we must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. Following the sale of certain assets and subject to certain conditions, we must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. 
 The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes and the note guarantees are secured by a first-priority lien on all the collateral that secures the Credit Facilities, subject to a shared lien of equal priority with our and each guarantor s obligations under the Credit Facilities and subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens. 
 Outstanding Debt 
 At September 28, 2024, we had 1,445.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes, consisting of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of 945.0 million, 0.0 drawn down on the Revolving Credit Facility and 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes issued and outstanding. 
 At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate instruments. We have historically entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flow exposure associated with our variable-rate borrowings. At September 28, 2024, the Company did not have any interest rate swaps in effect. Further information regarding our use of interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The weighted average interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on our outstanding debt, exclusive of the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately 7.77 and 7.64 per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates. The weighted average interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on our outstanding debt, including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately 7.39 and 6.53 per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates.

 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
 Our accumulated other comprehensive loss includes changes in the effects of foreign currency translations and the fair value of derivative instruments. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the cumulative balance of the effects of foreign currency translations, net of taxes, was a loss of 14.6 million and a loss of 17.5 million, respectively.

Dividends and Stock Transactions 
 We do not currently pay a dividend and we have no current plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, after taking into account our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the provisions of Virginia law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders and such other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants in our existing indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities and the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, and may be limited by the agreements governing other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future. 
 On October 9, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized, and we announced, a program to repurchase up to 250.0 million of our outstanding common stock. On each of June 13, 2005, May 25, 2006 and October 21, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized, and we announced, the addition of 250.0 million to this program. The repurchase program allows for shares to be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program currently has no expiration date. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program. 
 EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt 
 We define EBITDAS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation and Adjusted EBITDAS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs and former CEO separation expenses. 
 The table below sets forth the reconciliations for EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS to net loss for the trailing twelve months ended September 28, 2024:

 We present EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS because we consider them to be useful supplemental measures of our performance. In addition, we believe EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS are useful to investors, analysts and rating agencies in measuring the ability of a company to meet its debt service obligations. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures herein for an explanation of our use of these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in arrangements that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. 
 SEASONALITY 
 Our business is seasonal due to the importance of the winter season to our overall member recruitment environment. Historically, we experience our highest level of recruitment during the first quarter of the year, which is supported with the highest concentration of advertising spending. Therefore, our number of End of Period Subscribers in the first quarter of the year has been typically higher than the number in other quarters of the year, historically reflecting a decline over the course of the year. 
 AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 Corporate information and our press releases, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are available free of charge on our corporate website at corporate.ww.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make available at that site the Section 16 reports filed electronically by our officers, directors and 10 percent shareholders. 
 51 

We use our corporate website at corporate.ww.com and certain social media channels such as our Instagram account (Instagram.com/weightwatchers), corporate Facebook page (www.facebook.com/weightwatchers), X (formerly Twitter) account (@ww_us) and LinkedIn page (www.linkedin.com/company/weightwatchers) as channels of distribution of Company information. The information we post through these channels may be deemed material. Accordingly, investors should monitor these channels, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. The contents of our website and social media channels shall not be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Pursuant to their respective terms, our interest rate swaps in effect as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 terminated on March 31, 2024. Given subsequent market conditions, management determined to not enter into any new swap arrangements following such termination. Except for the impact from the termination of such swap arrangements discussed below, as of September 28, 2024, the market risk disclosures appearing in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 have not materially changed from December 30, 2023. 
 At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bore interest at Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 3.50 . For the Term Loan Facility, the minimum interest rate for Term SOFR applicable to such facility pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement was set at 0.50 , referred to herein as the Term SOFR Floor. Accordingly, as of September 28, 2024, based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and the then-current Term SOFR rate, after giving consideration to the Term SOFR Floor, a hypothetical 125 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased annual interest expense by approximately 11.8 million and a hypothetical 125 basis point decrease in interest rates would have decreased annual interest expense by approximately 11.8 million. This change in market risk exposure from the end of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swaps on March 31, 2024 discussed above. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 10 Legal of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors from those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 other than as set forth below. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 Our new compounded GLP-1 offering exposes us to a variety of risks that could result in an adverse impact on our reputation, business and ability to effectively compete. 
 In October 2024, we began offering to our eligible Clinical members access to compounded semaglutide, a GLP-1 prescription medication, sourced via a 503B outsourcing facility (the Manufacturing Supplier and dispensed by a licensed 503A pharmacy Dispensing Pharmacy ). A 503B outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA ), including registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ). The facility must also operate in compliance with the FDA s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations and guidance and is subject to FDA inspection relating to compliance with cGMPs. If the Manufacturing Supplier or any of its compounded products are found by the FDA not to satisfy the criteria set forth in Section 503B, it may not be able to fulfill the prescriptions prescribed by our clinicians, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing facilities have been subject to increased scrutiny of their compounding activities by the FDA and state governmental agencies, and a governmental inquiry or action or litigation could be brought against us, the Dispensing Pharmacy or the Manufacturing Supplier relating to GLP-1 compounding activities. In such a case, we may experience negative publicity and reputational harm. Manufacturers of the branded GLP-1 medications also have brought private actions against compounders and outsourcing facilities, as well as prescribers of compounded medications, including against med-spas, medical practices and telehealth providers, and such action or litigation could be brought against us. The Manufacturing Supplier is legally permitted to produce the sourced version of compounded semaglutide while the equivalent branded GLP-1 active ingredient appears on the FDA drug shortage list, and we cannot predict when such shortage will be resolved. All doses of semaglutide branded under Ozempic and Wegovy became listed as available on the FDA s shortage list as of October 30, 2024. As of November 4, 2024, the FDA considers semaglutide injection to continue to be in shortage, but it may determine to resolve the shortage in the future, which could constrain our ability to continue providing access to compounded semaglutide on our platform once inventory is no longer available. Additionally, on October 22, 2024, Novo Nordisk filed a Petition with the FDA, requesting that semaglutide products be added to the lists of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding pursuant to the FDCA Sections 503A(b)(3) and 503B(a)(6) (the Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists or DDC Lists ). If added to the DDC Lists, 503A pharmacies and 503B facilities would be prohibited from producing compounded semaglutide, even if it is taken off the shortage list. The regulatory landscape applicable to GLP-1s continues to rapidly evolve. Additionally, many branded GLP-1 medications are protected under intellectual property laws that limit the formulations that other parties may use, and our promotion of compounded formulations may result in our being subject to infringement claims and other litigation, which could adversely affect our ability to effectively compete. While the FDA does not limit compounding to drug shortages, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue this offering in the same manner, to the same extent, or at all, due to a variety of factors outside our control, including intellectual property, regulatory and resource allocation matters, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Achieving and maintaining market acceptance of this new offering could be negatively impacted by perceived risks associated with compounded medications. Certain compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing facilities have experienced both facility and product quality issues and been the subject of negative media coverage. We or the Manufacturing Supplier or Dispensing Pharmacy may also face allegations, litigation, and regulatory investigations under federal or state laws related to the marketing, fulfillment, distribution, and/or sale of these products. Litigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the healthcare, pharmaceutical-related, consumer protection, data privacy and/or class action matters we could face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Such litigation or regulatory proceedings and investigations, FDA shortage list implications, unexpected side effects or safety or efficacy concerns with our compounded semaglutide offering (or GLP-1s as a class) or related negative publicity could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and ability to effectively compete. 
 53 

We are undergoing a chief executive officer transition, which could cause disruption to our business, and our failure to appoint a permanent chief executive officer with the required level of experience and expertise could have an adverse impact on our operations and business strategy as well as the public or market perception of our business . 
 In September 2024, the Company and Sima Sistani, the Company s then-President and Chief Executive Officer, mutually agreed that Ms. Sistani would cease serving as the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 27, 2024. The Board of Directors appointed Tara Comonte, a director of the Company, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 27, 2024, to serve until a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer is identified. If we are unsuccessful in appointing a permanent chief executive officer with the required level of experience and expertise, our operations and business strategy could be materially and adversely affected. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition involves inherent risk and can be difficult to manage. It may involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations, make it more difficult to hire and retain key employees, impact public or market perception or hinder progress on key strategic initiatives, any of which could have a negative impact on our business or stock price.
