These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

For purposes of this Quarterly Report, Tel-Instrument, we, our, us, or similar references refers to Tel-Instrument Electronics, Inc, unless the context requires otherwise. 

Overview 

Despite the increasing backlog of 7.9 million on September 30, 2024, TIC had three major component delays that prevented shipment of outstanding orders on our two main revenue drivers. This included an extensive delay in battery deliveries and one PCB for our CRAFT product which currently has 4 million of backlog. We were also unable to ship any SDR-OMNI test sets due to delays with a PCB supplier. We received the CRAFT test set parts at the end of the last fiscal quarter and are now actively building units. The SDR-OMNI PCB is expected to arrive in early November 2024. As such, we expect a significant improvement in revenues and profits for the second half of the fiscal year. 

The Company reported net sales of 1,777,342 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales of 1,565,094 for the same three month period in the prior fiscal year. The Company reported net sales of 4,619,518 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales of 4,432,024 for the same six month period in the prior fiscal year. 

Gross margin for the current quarter was 206,940 (12 which is approximately 11 percentage points lower than the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 359,484 (23 ). This was primarily attributable to increased fixed production costs being spread over decreased volumes. Gross margin for the current six months ended September 30, 2024 was 952,842 (21 which is approximately 16 percentage points lower than the six months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,654,034 (37 ). This is primarily attributable to the Navy Craft ECP margin true up as the program is nearing completion and engineering labor hours have exceeded our projections. Approximately 730,000 of Navy funding remains on this contract which should be completed in FY 2025. Once the development work is completed, production revenues of approximately 5 million per year are expected over a four-year period.

Overview (continued) 

Net loss was 814,594 and 772,346 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a loss of 435,153 and 139,861 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The net loss increased versus the prior year due to the CRAFT ECP costs increasing versus the forecasted levels. 

Backlog orders on September 30, 2024, were 7.9 million compared to 7.2 million as of March 31, 2024. Backlog has increased since then due in part to the receipt of a 1.55 million order for the new MADL test set for the F-35 program. 

The Company continues to pursue opportunities in the domestic and international market for our Mode 5 test sets. We continue to receive substantial orders from the U.S. Government and Northrup Grumman for our AN/USM-708 CRAFT Mode 5 and MADL test sets. 

TIC has spent several years and millions of dollars in developing our ground-breaking SDR/OMNI and SDR-OMNI/MIL product which will address both the commercial market for transponder and navigation test sets as well as competing in the military secure comm test set market. The SDR/OMNI product line supports a wide frequency range to accommodate new commercial and military waveforms in an industry leading 4.5-pound package. This is approximately half the weight of competitive test sets. It is also the only new multi-purpose test set which meets the Class 1 military environmental specifications. It utilizes the latest touch screen technology and has the capability to replace all TIC commercial test sets and military flight-line test sets with one handheld product. The Company started initial production deliveries in December 2022. The Company recently received an order from Airbus for SDR-OMNI test sets to replace the obsolete test sets used in their world-wide manufacturing. This is a significant win as Airbus evaluated competitive products and selected the SDR-OMNI due to its faster speed and ease of use. In August 2024, the Company received a follow-on order from Airbus with additional orders expected. We have added a direct sales representative for the SDR-OMNI and are instituting a customer demo program which should allow us to significantly extend our sales reach for smaller customers. To our knowledge, every commercial customer that evaluates our test sets versus the competition has selected the SDR-OMNI. 

TIC recently released the SDR-OMNI/MIL test set which adds SIF and TACAN test capability. The SDR-OMNI/MIL has received positive reviews from the U.S. DOD and international military customers. We have also received an NSN number which is needed to sell to the U.S. military. We have already received purchase orders from Italy, South Korea, Germany and from the U.S. DOD. This is designed to replace thousands of obsolete military test sets currently in use. This is expected to be a significant driver of both revenues and future profitability. There are several companies competing in this market space, but we believe that our SDR-OMNI/MIL design will be extremely competitive. 

TIC is also exploring new avenues to broaden its product portfolio including designing a high frequency test set for the Lockheed Martin F-35 program. This contract takes advantage of our expertise in RF technology. This is a completely new market for TIC as it involves high frequency communication signals. TIC recently received a 1.55 million production contract with Northrup Grumman for the new MADL test set. 

Results of Operations 

Sales 

Net sales increased 212,248 or 14 to 1,777,342 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales of 1,565,094 for the same three month period in the prior fiscal year. Net sales increased 187,494 or 4 to 4,619,518 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net sales of 4,432,024 for the same six month period in the prior fiscal year. The respective increases in sales were due to mix of product sale customer demand. 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin for the current quarter was 206,940 (12 which is approximately 11 percentage points lower than the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 359,484 (23 ). This was primarily attributable to increased fixed production costs being spread over decreased volumes due to parts issues for both the CRAFT and SDR-OMNI product lines. Gross margin for the current six months ended September 30, 2024 was 952,842 (21 which is approximately 16 percentage points lower than the six months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,654,034 (37 ). This is primarily attributable to the Navy Craft ECP margin true up as the program is nearing completion and engineering labor hours have exceeded our projections. Approximately 730,000 of Navy funding remains on this contract which should be completed in calendar year 2024. Once the development work is completed, production revenues of approximately 5 million per year are expected over a four-year period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of 3,264,454 as compared to working capital of 4,249,777 at March 31, 2024. This included 242,366 of cash on hand and 813,801 of accounts receivable. 

The Company s principal sources, and uses of funds were as follows: 

Cash used in operating activities. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, 285,147 in cash from operations was used, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 6,182,187 which included 6,559,233 used for the settlement of the Aeroflex judgement. 

Cash used in investing activities . For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not use any cash for purchases of equipment as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 32,352. 

Cash provided by financing activities. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provided 395,500 from funds received from the Bank of America line of credit 275,000 and short term related party loans 120,500 as compared to 721,000 funds provided for in the six months ended September 30, 2023 from issuance of Series B and C Preferred Stock. 

The Bank of America line of credit was renewed, and the current line of credit matures July 31, 2025 with an available line of 1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, 965,000 of the line of credit was used. 

Moving forward, we believe that our expected cash flows from increased operations and increased accounts receivable payments will be sufficient to operate in the normal course of business for next 12 months from the issuance date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. 

Currently, the Company has no material future capital expenditure requirements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item. We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective in providing reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

2. 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

3. 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures. 

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024, because management identified that there was a lack of adherence to formal policies and procedures with inventory controls. 

23

Table of Contents 

Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: 

Management personnel, including our Chief Accounting Officer, are overseeing the financial reporting process and implementation of enhanced controls and governance; 

Formation of an internal task team to enhance weaknesses over inventory movement, valuation, and internal controls. 

Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal controls environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible. We have documented key procedures and controls using a risk-based approach and have, therefore, made progress toward remediation. We continue to implement our remediation plan, which includes continued engagement of an external financial consulting firm to enhance financial reporting and operations as well as design and implementation of controls. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and Management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that occurred during our last completed fiscal quarter that has materially negatively affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As discussed above, management has remediation plans that will be implemented during fiscal year 2025.
