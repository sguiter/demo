 (7) million of remaining unfunded commitments. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold a senior loan collateralized by a portfolio of multifamily properties located in San Francisco, CA. We obtained a true-sale-at-law opinion and determined the transaction constituted a sale. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into an agreement with the transferee which provides for a share of cash flows from the senior

million, resulting in a million principal repayment and the remaining million principal being bifurcated into a million loan secured by a retail property and a million unsecured personal loan, both of which are accompanied by credit support. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we modified a loan with a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulties, resulting in a maturity extension to June 10, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the loan had total commitments and an amortized cost basis of million, represents approxi mately of total loans receivable held-for-investment, based on carrying value net of any specific CECL reserves, is current on interest payments, is in maturity default, and is risk rated 4.

Loan Risk Ratings As further described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we evaluate the credit quality of our loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. In conjunction with our quarterly loan portfolio review, we assess the risk factors of each loan and assign a risk rating based on several factors, including, but not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized debt yield, term of loan, property type, property or collateral location, loan type, structure, collateral cash flow volatility and other more subjective variables that include, but are not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized collateral value, market conditions, industry conditions, borrower/sponsor financial stability, and borrower/sponsor exit plan. While evaluating the credit quality of each loan within our portfolio, we assess these quantitative and qualitative factors as a whole and with no pre-prescribed weight on their impact to our determination of a loan s risk rating. However, based upon the facts and circumstances for each loan and the current market conditions, we may consider certain previously mentioned factors more or less relevant than others. Loans are rated 1 (less risk) through 5 (greater risk), which ratings are defined in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

(1) 

 (2) of unpaid principal balance of loans with specific CECL reserves. As of September 30, 2024, general CECL reserves approximated of unpaid principal balance of loans subject to the general CECL reserve. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of million, which consisted of a million increase in our general CECL reserve and a million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to principal and accrued interest receivable charge-offs. The increase in general CECL reserves was primarily attributable to changes in the historical loss rate of the analogous dataset and changes in risk ratings, non-accrual status, and expected remaining duration within our loan portfolio, offset by the reduction in the size of our loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our total current expected credit loss reserve was million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of million , which included a million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to a principal charge-off and a reversal of million of general CECL reserves. This reversal of general CECL reserves was primarily attributable to the seasoning of our loan portfolio and a reduction in the size of our loan portfolio, offset by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. As of September 30, 2023, our total current expected credit loss reserve was million. Specific CECL Reserves In certain circumstances, we may determine that a loan is no longer suited for the WARM method as we have deemed the borrower to be experiencing financial difficulty and the repayment of the loan s principal is collateral dependent.

Deferred Compensation Plan On May 24, 2022, we adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan to provide our directors and certain executives with an opportunity to defer payment of their stock-based compensation or RSUs and director cash fees, if applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, certain of our Board members elected to receive the annual fees and/or time-based RSUs to which they are entitled under our Non-Employee Director Compensation Program in the form of deferred RSUs. Accordingly, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we issued and , respectively, of deferred RSUs in lieu of cash fees to such directors and recognized a related expense of approximately and , respectively.

Eligible non-executive members of the Board were granted the time-based RSUs under the Plan. Each RSU was granted with the right to receive dividend equivalents.

million , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs. Such expense is considered a non-cash expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the applicable award s vesting period. Forfeitures of stock-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur. As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense was million based on the grant date fair value of RSUs granted. This expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining period of years from September 30, 2024. We may allow participants of the Plan to settle their tax liabilities through a reduction of their vested RSU delivery. Such amount will result in a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital and a cash payment to our Manager or its affiliates in order to remit the required statutory tax withholding to each respective taxing authority. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered a total of shares of our common stock for vested RSUs and concurrently recorded a million adjustment to additional paid-in capital on our consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Since Commencement of Operations, we have been in compliance with all REIT requirements and we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Therefore, other than amounts relating to our taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ), as described below, we have not provided for current income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, no provision has been made for federal or state income taxes in the accompanying financial statements, as we believe we have met the prescribed requisite requirements. Our real estate owned hotel portfolio is held in a TRS. A TRS is a corporation that is owned directly or indirectly by a REIT and has jointly elected with the REIT to be treated as a TRS for tax purposes. Given the TRS s history of generating taxable losses, we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future benefit of the TRS s deferred tax assets and therefore recorded a full valuation allowance. Given the full valuation allowance, we did not record a provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and we did t have any deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The deferred tax asset and valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 wer e million, respectively. The deferred tax asset and valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 were million, respectively. We recognize tax benefits for uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, if applicable, are included as a component of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we have t recorded any amounts for uncertain tax positions. Our tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities. As of the date of this filing, tax years 2021 and onward remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxes.

Introduction We are a CRE finance company focused primarily on originating senior and subordinate loans on transitional CRE assets located in major U.S. markets, including mortgage loans secured by a first priority or subordinate mortgage on transitional CRE assets, and subordinate loans including mezzanine loans secured by a pledge of equity ownership interests in the direct or indirect property owner rather than directly in the underlying commercial properties. These loans are subordinate to a mortgage loan but senior to the property owner s equity ownership interests. Transitional CRE assets are properties that require repositioning, renovation, rehabilitation, leasing, development or redevelopment or other value-added elements in order to maximize value. We believe our Sponsor s real estate development, ownership and operations experience, and infrastructure differentiates us in lending on these transitional CRE assets. Our objective is to be a premier provider of debt capital for transitional CRE assets and, in doing so, to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over time, primarily through dividends. We strive to create a diversified investment portfolio of CRE loans that we generally intend to hold to maturity. We focus primarily on originating loans ranging from 50 million to 300 million on transitional CRE assets located in U.S. markets with attractive fundamental characteristics supported by macroeconomic tailwinds. Our loan origination and repayment volume may fluctuate based on market conditions or other conditions inherent in our portfolio. As such, we may modify our investment strategy from time to time by shifting focus to optimizing outcomes within our existing portfolio, which may include actions such as selling a loan or syndicating a portion of a loan, and working with our borrowers to enhance the value of underlying properties that constitute our collateral. We were organized as a Maryland corporation on April 29, 2015 and commenced operations on August 25, 2015, and our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol CMTG. We have elected and believe we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act. I. Key Financial Measures and Indicators As a CRE finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are net income (loss) per share, Distributable Earnings (Loss) per share, Distributable Earnings per share prior to realized gains and losses, which includes charge-offs of principal and/or accrued interest receivable, dividends declared per share, book value per share, adjusted book value per share, Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss per share of 0.40, Distributable Loss per share of 0.17, Distributable Earnings per share prior to realized losses of 0.22, and dividends declared per share of 0.10. As of September 30, 2024, our book value per share was 14.83, our adjusted book value per share was 15.96, our Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio was 2.4x, and our Total Leverage Ratio was 2.8x. We use Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio, financial measures which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate our financial leverage, which in the case of our Total Leverage Ratio, makes certain adjustments that we believe provide a more conservative measure of our financial condition. Net Loss Per Share and Dividends Declared Per Share The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share and dividends declared per share in thousands, except share and per share data):

We intend to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders, although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. Distributable Earnings (Loss) Distributable Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions, non-cash items and GAAP adjustments, as determined by our Manager. Distributable Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (ii) real estate owned depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains or losses from mark-to-market valuation changes (other than permanent impairments) that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable period, (iv) one-time events pursuant to changes 

 32 

in GAAP and (v) certain non-cash items, which in the judgment of our Manager, should not be included in Distributable Earnings (Loss). Furthermore, the Company presents Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses, which includes charge-offs of principal and/or accrued interest receivable, as the Company believes this more easily allows our Board, Manager, and investors to compare our operating performance to our peers, to assess our ability to declare and pay dividends, and to determine our compliance with certain financial covenants. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we use Core Earnings, which is substantially the same as Distributable Earnings (Loss) excluding incentive fees, to determine the incentive fees we pay our Manager. We believe that Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses provide meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses do not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), an indication of our cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating these non-GAAP measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures and, accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses reported by other companies. In order to maintain our status as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, as dividends. Distributable Earnings (Loss), Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses, and other similar measures, have historically been a useful indicator over time of a mortgage REIT s ability to cover its dividends, and to mortgage REITs themselves in determining the amount of any dividends to declare. Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses are key factors, among others, considered by the Board in determining the dividend each quarter and as such we believe Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized gains and losses are also useful to investors. While Distributable Earnings (Loss) excludes the impact of our provision for or reversal of current expected credit loss reserve, charge-offs of principal and/or accrued interest receivable are recognized through Distributable Earnings (Loss) when deemed non-recoverable. Non-recoverability is determined (i) upon the resolution of a loan (i.e., when the loan is repaid, fully or partially, when we acquire title in the case of foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or assignment-in-lieu of foreclosure, or when the loan is sold for an amount less than its carrying value), or (ii) with respect to any amount due under any loan, when such amount is determined to be uncollectible. In determining Distributable Earnings (Loss) per share and Distributable Earnings per share prior to realized gains and losses, the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs is considered. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for Distributable Earnings (Loss) and Distributable Earnings per share prior to realized gains and losses have been adjusted from weighted average diluted shares under GAAP to include weighted average unvested RSUs. The table below summarizes the reconciliation from weighted average diluted shares under GAAP to the weighted average diluted shares used for Distributable (Loss) Earnings and Distributable Earnings prior to realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

 Book Value Per Share We believe that presenting book value per share adjusted for the general current expected credit loss reserve and accumulated depreciation and amortization on our real estate owned and related lease intangibles is useful for investors as it enhances the comparability to our peers. We believe that our investors and lenders consider book value excluding these items as an important metric related to our overall capitalization.

(1) Loan commitment represents principal outstanding plus remaining unfunded loan commitments. 

 (2) Net of specific CECL reserve of 111.5 million. 

 (3) Weighted averages are based on unpaid principal balance. 

 (4) Represents the weighted average annualized yield to initial maturity of each loan, inclusive of coupon, and fees received, based on the applicable floating benchmark rate/floors (if applicable), in place as of September 30, 2024. For loans placed on non-accrual, the annualized yield to initial maturity used in calculating the weighted average annualized yield to initial maturity is 0 . 

34 

(5) Fully extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions. 

 (6) Origination LTV represents loan-to-value or loan-to-cost, which is calculated as our total loan commitment upon origination, as if fully funded, plus any financings that are pari passu with or senior to our loan, divided by our estimate of either (1) the value of the underlying real estate, determined in accordance with our underwriting process (typically consistent with, if not less than, the value set forth in a third-party appraisal) or (2) the borrower s projected, fully funded cost basis in the asset, in each case as we deem appropriate for the relevant loan and other loans with similar characteristics. Underwritten values and projected costs should not be assumed to reflect our judgment of current market values or project costs, which may have changed materially since the date of origination. Weighted average origination LTV is based on loan commitment, including non-consolidated senior interests and pari passu interests, and excludes risk rated 5 loans. 

 (7) Adjusted LTV represents origination LTV updated only in connection with a partial loan paydown and/or release of collateral, material changes to expected project costs, the receipt of a new appraisal (typically in connection with financing or refinancing activity) or a change in our loan commitment. Adjusted LTV should not be assumed to reflect our judgment of current market values or project costs, which may have changed materially since the date of the most recent determination of LTV. Weighted average adjusted LTV is based on loan commitment, including non-consolidated senior interests, pari passu interests, and risk rated 5 loans. Loans with specific CECL reserves are reflected as 100 LTV.

(1) Loan commitment represents principal outstanding plus remaining unfunded loan commitments. 

 (2) Net of specific CECL reserve of 111.5 million. 

 (3) Origination LTV represents loan-to-value or loan-to-cost, which is calculated as our total loan commitment upon origination, as if fully funded, plus any financings that are pari passu with or senior to our loan, divided by our estimate of either (1) the value of the underlying real estate, determined in accordance with our underwriting process (typically consistent with, if not less than, the value set forth in a third-party appraisal) or (2) the borrower s projected, fully funded cost basis in the asset, in each case as we deem appropriate for the relevant loan and other loans with similar characteristics. Underwritten values and projected costs should not be assumed to reflect our judgment of current market values or project costs, which may have changed materially since the date of origination. Weighted average origination LTV of 70.0 is based on loan commitment, including non-consolidated senior interests and pari passu interests, and excludes risk rated 5 loans. 

 (4) Fully extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions. 

 (5) Classification of property type and construction status reflect the state of collateral as of September 30, 2024. 

 (6) Percent of total construction loans based on loan commitments as of September 30, 2024.

Real Estate Owned On February 8, 2021, we acquired legal title to a portfolio of seven limited service hotels located in New York, NY through a foreclosure. As of September 30, 2024, the hotel portfolio appears as part of real estate owned, net on our consolidated balance sheet and is encumbered by a 280.0 million securitized senior mortgage, which is included as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. On June 30, 2023, we acquired legal title to a mixed-use property located in New York, NY and the equity interests in the borrower through an assignment-in-lieu of foreclosure, and is comprised of office, retail, and signage components. As of September 30, 2024, the mixed-use property appears as part of real estate owned, net and related lease intangibles, net appear within other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details. Asset Management Our Manager proactively manages the loans in our portfolio from closing to final repayment and our Sponsor has dedicated asset management employees to perform asset management services. Following the closing of an investment, the asset management team rigorously monitors the loan, with an emphasis on ongoing analyses of both quantitative and qualitative matters, including financial, legal, and market conditions. Through the final repayment of a loan, the asset management team maintains regular contact with borrowers, servicers and local market experts monitoring performance of the collateral, anticipating borrower, property and market issues, and enforcing our rights and remedies when appropriate. Some of our borrowers may experience delays in the execution of their business plans or changes in market conditions which may impact the performance of the underlying collateral asset, borrower, or sponsor. As a transitional lender, we may from time to time execute loan modifications with borrowers when and if appropriate, which may include additional equity contributions from them, repurposing of reserves, pledges of additional collateral or other forms of credit support, additional guarantees, temporary deferrals of interest or principal, and/or partial deferral of coupon interest as payment-in-kind interest. To the extent warranted by ongoing conditions specific to our borrowers or overall market conditions, we may make additional modifications when and if appropriate, and depending on the business plans, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations of our borrowers, among other factors. Our Manager evaluates the credit quality of each of our loans receivable on an individual basis and assigns a risk rating at least quarterly. We have developed a loan grading system for all of our outstanding loans receivable that are collateralized directly or indirectly by real estate. Grading criteria include, but are not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized debt yield, term of loan, property type, property or collateral location, loan type, structure, collateral cash flow volatility and other more subjective variables that include, but are not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized collateral value, market conditions, industry conditions, borrower/sponsor financial stability, and borrower/sponsor exit plan. While evaluating the credit quality of each loan within our portfolio, we assess these quantitative and qualitative factors as a whole and with no pre-prescribed weight on their impact to our determination of a loan s risk rating. However, based upon the facts and circumstances for each loan and the overall market conditions, we may consider certain previously mentioned factors more or less relevant than others. We utilize the grading system to determine each loan s risk of loss and to provide a determination as to whether an individual loan is impaired and whether a specific CECL reserve is necessary. Based on a 5-point scale, the loans are graded 1 through 5, from less risk to greater risk, respectively. The weighted average risk rating of our total loan portfolio was 3.5 as of September 30, 2024. Current Expected Credit Losses The current expected credit loss reserve required under GAAP reflects our current estimate of potential credit losses related to our loan commitments, which may fluctuate depending on market conditions and changes in our loan portfolio. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our current expected credit loss reserve methodology. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 182.6 million, which consisted of a 45.5 million increase in our general CECL reserve and a 137.1 million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to principal and accrued interest receivable charge-offs. The increase in general CECL reserves was primarily attributable to changes in the historical loss rate of the analogous dataset and changes in risk ratings, non-accrual status, and expected remaining duration within our loan portfolio, offset by the reduction in the size of our loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our total current expected credit loss reserve was 237.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 148.4 million, which included a 151.5 million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to a principal charge-off and a reversal of 3.1 million of general CECL reserves. This reversal of general CECL reserves was primarily attributable to the seasoning of our loan portfolio and a 

 37 

reduction in the size of our loan portfolio, offset by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. As of September 30, 2023, our total current expected credit loss reserve was 154.9 million. Specific CECL Reserves In certain circumstances, we may determine that a loan is no longer suited for the WARM method as we have deemed the borrower to be experiencing financial difficulty and the repayment of the loan s principal is collateral dependent.

 Fair market values used to determine specific CECL reserves are calculated using a discounted cash flow model, a sales comparison approach, or a market capitalization approach. Estimates of fair market values used to determine specific CECL reserves as of September 30, 2024 include assumptions of property specific cash flows over estimated holding periods, assumptions of property redevelopment costs, assumptions of leasing activities, discount rates ranging from 6.0 to 9.5 , and market and terminal capitalization rates ranging from 5.25 to 8.25 . These assumptions are based upon the nature of the properties, recent sales and lease comparables, recent and projected property cash flows, and anticipated real estate and capital market conditions.

As of September 30, 2024, the loans securing the outstanding borrowings under these facilities had a weighted average term to initial maturity and fully extended maturity of 0.7 years and 2.1 years, respectively, assuming all conditions to extend are met. Each repurchase agreement contains margin maintenance provisions, which are designed to allow the counterparty to require the delivery of cash or other assets to de-lever financings on assets that are determined to have experienced a diminution in value. Since inception through September 30, 2024, we have not received any margin calls under any of our repurchase agreements. Loan Participations Sold We may finance certain of our loans via the sale of a participation in such loans, and we present the loan participations sold as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet when such arrangements do not qualify as sales under GAAP. In instances where we have multiple loan participations with the same lender, the financings are generally not cross-collateralized. Each of our loan participations sold is generally term-matched to its underlying loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had no loan participations sold. Notes Payable We finance certain of our loans via secured financings that are term matched to the underlying loan, some of which are partially recourse to us. We refer to such financings as notes payable and they are secured by the related loans receivable. As of September 30, 2024, four of our loans were financed with notes payable. Secured Term Loan We have a secured term loan which we originally entered into on August 9, 2019. Our secured term loan is presented net of any original issue discount and transaction expenses which are deferred and recognized as interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. The secured term loan matures on August 9, 2026 and as of September 30, 2024 has an unpaid principal balance of 719.7 million and a carrying value of 710.5 million. Debt Related to Real Estate Owned On February 8, 2021 we assumed a 300.0 million securitized senior mortgage in connection with a foreclosure of a hotel portfolio. On February 7, 2024, we modified our debt related to real estate owned to provide for, among other things, an extension of the contractual maturity date to November 9, 2024, a 10.0 million principal paydown, and the designation of a portion of the loan becoming partial recourse to us. Concurrent with this modification, we purchased an interest rate cap with a notional amount of 280.0 million and a strike rate of 5.00 through the extended contractual maturity date for 0.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, our debt related to real estate owned has an unpaid principal balance of 280.0 million, a carrying value of 279.7 million and a stated rate of SOFR plus 2.90 . See Derivatives below for further detail of our interest rate cap. 

 39 

Derivatives As part of the agreement to amend the terms of our debt related to real estate owned on June 2, 2021, we acquired an interest rate cap with a notional amount of 290.0 million, a strike rate of 3.00 , and a maturity date of February 15, 2024 for 0.3 million. Such interest rate cap effectively limited the maximum interest rate of our debt related to real estate owned to 5.83 through its maturity. On February 7, 2024 and in connection with the modification of our debt related to real estate owned, we acquired an interest rate cap with a notional amount of 280.0 million, a strike rate of 5.00 , and a maturity date of November 15, 2024. for 0.5 million. Such interest rate cap effectively limits the maximum interest rate of our debt related to real estate owned to 7.90 through its maturity. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate cap are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on interest rate cap on our consolidated statements of operations and the fair value is recorded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds received from our counterparty related to the interest rate cap are recorded as proceeds from interest rate cap on our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 the fair value of our interest rate cap was de minimis, and as of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our interest rate cap was 0.9 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 0.2 million and 1.7 million, respectively, of proceeds from interest rate cap. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.3 million and 4.4 million, respectively, of proceeds from interest rate cap. Short-Term Funding Facility On June 29, 2022, we entered into a full recourse revolving credit facility with 150.0 million in capacity, which generally provided interim financing for eligible loans for up to 180 days at an initial advance rate of up to 75 . As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding balance on the facility. On September 25, 2024, we terminated this facility, at which point we had no outstanding balance. Financial Covenants Our financing agreements generally contain certain financial covenants. For example, our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest charges Interest Coverage Ratio ), as defined in our repurchase agreements and term participation facility shall not be less than 1.3 to 1.0, whereas our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest charges as defined in our secured term loan shall not be less than 1.5 to 1.0. Further, (i) our tangible net worth, as defined in the agreements, shall not be less than 1.86 billion as of each measurement date; (ii) cash liquidity shall not be less than the greater of (x) 50 million or (y) 5 of our recourse indebtedness (which includes our secured term loan); and (iii) our indebtedness shall not exceed 77.8 of our total assets. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants under our financing agreements. The requirements set forth in (i) through (iii) above are based upon the most restrictive financial covenants in place as of the reporting date. Further, we have modified the Interest Coverage Ratio in our repurchase agreements and term participation facility to provide that for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 through September 30, 2025, our Interest Coverage Ratio shall not be less than 1.1 to 1.0. Future compliance with our financial covenants is dependent upon the results of our operating activities, our financial condition, and the overall market conditions in which we and our borrowers operate. The impact of macroeconomic conditions on the commercial real estate and capital markets, including high benchmark interest rates compared to recent historical standards, may make it more difficult for us to satisfy these covenants in the future. Non-compliance with financial covenants may result in our lenders exercising their rights and remedies as provided for in the respective agreements. As market conditions evolve, we may continue to work with our counterparties on modifying financial covenants as needed; however, there is no assurance that our counterparties will agree to such modifications. Non-Consolidated Senior Interests Sold and Non-Consolidated Senior Interests Held by Third Parties In certain instances, we use structural leverage through the non-recourse syndication of a match-term senior loan interest to a third party which qualifies for sale accounting under GAAP, or through the acquisition of a subordinate loan for which a non-recourse senior interest is retained by a third party. In such instances, the senior loan is not included on our consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes our non-consolidated senior interests and related retained subordinate interests, excluding for loans classified as held-for-sale, as of September 30, 2024 in thousands):

Floating and Fixed Rate Portfolio Our business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by originating floating rate loans and financing them with floating rate liabilities. Further, we seek to match the benchmark index in the floating rate loans we originate with the benchmark index used in the related floating rate financings. Generally, we use SOFR as the benchmark index in both our floating rate loans and floating rate financings. As of September 30, 2024, 97.9 of our loans receivable held-for-investment based on unpaid principal balance were floating rate and indexed to SOFR. All of our encumbered floating rate loans were financed with floating rate liabilities indexed to SOFR, which resulted in approximately 1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure. The following table details our net floating rate exposure as of September 30, 2024 in thousands):

(1) SOFR as of September 30, 2024 was 4.85 . Net floating rate exposure includes 487.0 million related to loans on non-accrual status. Excludes 269.7 million of net floating rate exposure related to three loans receivable with a total unpaid principal balance of 356.0 million which are classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2024 and an associated financing of 86.3 million. 

 As of September 30, 2024, we have an interest rate cap on our debt related to real estate owned with a notional amount of 280.0 million, a strike rate of 5.00 , and a maturity date of November 15, 2024. The interest rate cap effectively limits the maximum interest rate of our debt related to real estate owned to 7.90 through its maturity. We have not employed other interest rate derivatives (interest rate swaps, caps, collars or floors) to hedge our asset or liability portfolio, but we may do so in the future.

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 As previously disclosed, beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, and for all subsequent reporting periods, we have elected to present results of operations by comparing to the immediately preceding period, as well as the same year to date period in the prior year. Given the dynamic nature of our business and the sensitivity to the real estate and capital markets, we believe providing analysis of results of operations by comparing to the immediately preceding period is more meaningful to our stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our current business.

 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 Net Revenue Total net revenue increased 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue from real estate owned of 0.5 million due to slightly higher overall average occupancy and revenue per available room RevPAR levels at the hotel portfolio compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of 0.1 million, which was driven by a decrease in interest income of 2.3 million as a result of decreased average loans receivable balances and two loans being placed on non-accrual status effective July 1, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 2.1 million as a result of lower average borrowing levels during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 as a result of continued deleveraging. Expenses Expenses are primarily comprised of base management fees payable to our Manager, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense, operating expenses from real estate owned, interest expense from debt related to real estate owned, and depreciation and amortization on real estate owned and related in-place and other lease values. Expenses increased by 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to: (i) an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 1.0 million due to the forfeiture of restricted stock units recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024, which led to a reduction in expense for that quarter; 

42 

(ii) an increase in operating expenses from real estate owned of 0.9 million during the comparative period, due to slightly higher variable operating expenses in connection with slightly higher occupancy levels at the hotel portfolio; 

 (iii) partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of 1.2 million primarily as a result of a decrease in non-recurring charges incurred over the comparative period, generally related to professional fees, insurance expense, and other corporate level costs, including legal and professional fees related to establishing our ATM Agreement incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

 Proceeds from Interest Rate Cap Proceeds from interest rate cap decreased 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to SOFR falling below our interest rate cap s 5.0 strike rate. Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.3 million unrealized loss on interest rate cap, compared to a 0.1 million unrealized loss on interest rate cap during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The fair value of the interest rate cap increases as interest rates increase, decreases as the interest rate cap approaches maturity, and further fluctuates following shifts in the forward curve. Loss from Equity Method Investment During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized losses from our equity method investment of 0.1 million as a result of the net losses recognized by our investee during each respective period. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.3 million due to the recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from the termination of the short-term funding facility, partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized financing costs that were ultimately not owed upon the payoff of a loan participation. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.0 million due to the recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from the repayment of financing balances prior to maturity. Provision for Current Expected Credit Loss Reserve During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 78.8 million, which consisted of a 9.8 million reversal of our general CECL reserve and a 88.6 million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to a principal and accrued interest receivable charge-off, primarily attributable to the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale and related charge-offs, changes in the historical loss rate of the analogous dataset and changes in risk ratings, non-accrual status, and expected remaining duration within our loan portfolio, offset by the reduction in the size of our loan portfolio. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 33.9 million, which consisted of a 32.7 million increase in our general reserve and a 1.2 million in our specific CECL reserve prior to a principal charge-off, primarily attributable to changes in the historical loss rate of the analogous dataset and changes in risk ratings and non-accrual status within our loan portfolio, offset by the seasoning of our loan portfolio and a reduction in the size of our loan portfolio.

 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Net Revenue Total net revenue decreased 42.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of 49.0 million, which was driven by a decrease in interest income of 58.1 million as a result of a decreased loans receivable balance and an increase in loans on non-accrual status during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 9.1 million primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels. The decrease in total net revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue from real estate owned of 6.6 million due to revenue generated from the mixed-use property we acquired legal title to on June 30, 2023 and higher overall average occupancy and RevPAR levels at the hotel portfolio compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses Expenses are primarily comprised of base management fees payable to our Manager, incentive fees payable to our Manager, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense, operating expenses from real estate owned, interest expense from debt related to real estate owned, and depreciation and amortization on real estate owned and related in-place and other lease values. Expenses increased by 7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: (i) an increase in operating expenses from real estate owned of 6.5 million during the comparative period, due to an increase in professional fees incurred primarily as a result of the modification of our debt related to real estate owned, an increase in variable operating expenses in connection with higher occupancy levels at the hotel portfolio, and expenses incurred at the mixed-use property we acquired legal title to on June 30, 2023; 

44 

(ii) an increase in interest expense on debt related to real estate owned of 2.7 million primarily as a result of increased deferred financing costs recognized from fees incurred on the modification of our debt related to real estate owned in February 2024 and reference rate increases over the comparative period; 

 (iii) an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 1.2 million during the comparative period, due to restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense as a result of the forfeiture of restricted stock units recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; 

 (iv) an increase in depreciation and amortization from real estate owned of 1.1 million during the comparative period, due to depreciation and amortization recognized at the mixed-use property we acquired legal title to on June 30, 2023; 

 (v) partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees of 1.6 million as a result of core earnings over the trailing four quarters being in excess of a 7 hurdle as of September 30, 2023 but below the hurdle on a trailing four quarters basis in all subsequent periods; 

 (vi) partially offset by a decrease in management fees of 1.5 million as a result of lower stockholder s equity over the comparative period primarily due to principal charge-offs taken subsequent to September 30, 2023. 

 Gain on Sale of Loan During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we realized a gain on sale of loan totaling 0.6 million. We did not recognize any gains on loans sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from Interest Rate Cap Proceeds from interest rate cap decreased 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the in-place interest rate cap, which was acquired on February 15, 2024, having a higher strike rate than the previous interest rate cap. Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate Cap During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.4 million unrealized loss on interest rate cap, compared to a 3.3 million unrealized loss on interest rate cap during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In both cases the unrealized loss was driven by a reduction in the remaining duration of the interest rate cap; however, the interest rate cap held prior to its February 15, 2024 maturity had a strike rate of 3.0 , which resulted in a higher value and therefore a greater decline in value compared to the current interest rate cap which has a strike rate of 5.0 . The fair value of the interest rate cap increases as interest rates increase, decreases as the interest rate cap approaches maturity, and further fluctuates following shifts in the forward curve. (Loss) Income from Equity Method Investment During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss from our equity method investment of 0.1 million compared to income of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is a result of the loan held by the equity method investee being placed on non-accrual status effective April 1, 2023. (Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 3.5 million, inclusive of a 1.6 million spread maintenance payment, 2.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from the repayment of financing balances prior to maturity, partially offset by the 0.2 million reversal of previously recognized financing costs that were ultimately not owed upon the payoff of a loan participation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 2.2 million as a result of the retirement of 22.0 million of principal of our secured term loan for a price of 19.3 million. Provision for Current Expected Credit Loss Reserve During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 182.6 million, which consisted of a 45.5 million increase in our general CECL reserve and a 137.1 million increase in our specific CECL reserve prior to principal and accrued interest receivable charge-offs, primarily attributable to the reclassification of loans to held-for-sale and related charge-offs, changes in the historical loss rate of the analogous dataset and changes in risk ratings, non-accrual status, and expected remaining duration within our loan portfolio, offset by the reduction in the size of our loan portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of 148.4 million, primarily attributable to a 151.5 million increase in our specific CECL reserves prior to a principal charge-off, partially offset by a 3.1 million reversal of our general CECL reserves which was primarily attributable to seasoning of and a reduction in the size of our loan portfolio. 

 45 

Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance of shares of our common stock and borrowings under our secured financings and our secured term loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had 139,362,657 shares of our common stock outstanding, representing 2.1 billion of equity, and also had 5.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under our secured financings, our secured term loan, and our debt related to real estate owned. As of September 30, 2024, our secured financings consisted of five repurchase agreements with capacity of 4.9 billion and an outstanding balance of 3.5 billion, a term participation facility with a capacity of 464.3 million and an outstanding balance of 385.5 million, and four asset-specific financings with capacity of 380.8 million and an outstanding balance of 307.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our secured term loan had an outstanding balance of 719.7 million and our debt related to real estate owned had an outstanding balance of 280.0 million. Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio are non-GAAP measures that we use to evaluate our financial leverage, which in the case of our Total Leverage Ratio, makes certain adjustments that we believe provide a more conservative measure of our financial condition. Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio is calculated as the ratio of asset-specific debt (repurchase agreements, term participation facility, loan participations sold, net, notes payable, net, and debt related to real estate owned, net) and secured term loan, less cash and cash equivalents to total equity. Total Leverage Ratio is similar to Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio; however, it includes non-consolidated senior interests sold and non-consolidated senior interests held by third parties. Non-consolidated senior interests sold and non-consolidated senior interests held by third parties, as applicable, are secured by the same collateral as our loan and are structurally senior in repayment priority relative to our loan. We believe the inclusion of non-consolidated senior interests sold and non-consolidated senior interests held by third parties provides a meaningful measure of our financial leverage. The following table presents our Net Debt-to-Equity Ratios and Total Leverage Ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in thousands):

Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, interest income from our loans, proceeds from loan repayments, available borrowings under our repurchase agreements based on existing collateral, identified borrowing capacity related to our asset-specific financings based on existing collateral, proceeds from the issuance of incremental secured term loan or other corporate debt issuances, and proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. As circumstances warrant, we and our subsidiaries may also issue common equity, preferred equity and/or debt, incur other debt, including term loans, or explore sales of certain of our loans receivable or real estate owned properties from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Although we generally intend to hold our loans to maturity, sales of loans receivable, which may occur at an amount below our carrying value, or discounted loan repayments may occur in order to redeploy capital to more accretive opportunities, meet operating objectives, adapt to market conditions, and/or manage liquidity needs. Furthermore, we cannot predict the timing or impact of future

loan sales or loan repayments, and, since many of our loans are financed, a portion or in some cases all of the net proceeds from the sales or repayments of our loans are expected to be used to de-lever our secured financings.

 As of September 30, 2024, our mixed-use real estate owned property, which had a carrying value of 144.7 million including net lease intangible assets, was unencumbered. The ability to finance or sell certain of these unencumbered loans or our mixed-use real estate owned asset is subject to one or more counterparties willingness to finance or purchase such loans. To facilitate future offerings of equity, debt and other securities, we have in place an effective shelf registration statement (the Shelf with the SEC. The amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this Shelf was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit on the amount of securities we may issue. The securities covered by this Shelf include: (i) common stock, (ii) preferred stock, (iii) debt securities, (iv) depositary shares, (v) warrants, (vi) purchase contracts, and (vii) units. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering material, at the time of any offering. On May 10, 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with certain sales agents, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of 150.0 million of our common stock pursuant to a continuous offering program (the ATM Agreement under our Shelf. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the ATM Agreement may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The timing and amount of actual sales will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our capital needs, and our determination of the appropriate sources of funding to meet such needs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not issue any shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement, and we incurred 0.5 million of professional and legal fees to establish the program which are included in general and administrative expense on our 

 47 

consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the ATM Agreement has not been utilized, and 150.0 million remained available for issuance of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. Liquidity Needs In addition to our loan origination and acquisition activity, our primary liquidity needs include future fundings to our borrowers on our unfunded loan commitments, interest and principal payments on outstanding borrowings under our financings, operating expenses, accrued management fees, and dividend payments to our stockholders necessary to satisfy REIT dividend requirements. Additionally, certain financial covenants in our financing agreements require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity. We currently maintain, and seek to maintain, cash and liquidity to comply with minimum liquidity requirements under our financings, and we also seek to maintain excess cash and liquidity to meet our primary liquidity needs, including principal repayment obligations under certain of our secured financings. Our ability to make any such deleveraging payments is dependent upon the results of our operating activities, our financial condition, and the overall market conditions in which we operate, among other factors. As market conditions evolve, we continue to work with our secured financing counterparties as needed to seek adjustments to the timing and amount of any required principal repayment obligations; however, there is no assurance that such counterparties will agree to modify the required amount or timing of such repayments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and during the year ended December 31, 2023, we made deleveraging payments to certain of our financing counterparties in the amounts of 195.3 million and 357.0 million, respectively, and expect to continue to do so as agreed with our lenders or on an as-needed basis. As of September 30, 2024, we had aggregate unfunded loan commitments of 584.2 million which is comprised of funding for capital expenditures and construction, leasing costs, and carry costs. The timing of these fundings will vary depending on the progress of capital projects, leasing, and cash flows at the properties securing our loans and equity contributions from our borrowers, if required. Therefore, the exact timing and amounts of such future loan fundings are uncertain and will depend on the current and future performance of the underlying collateral assets, but are expected to occur over the remaining loan term. In certain circumstances, conditions to funding may not be met by our borrowers and portions of our unfunded loan commitments may never become eligible to be drawn on. We may from time to time use capital to retire, redeem, or repurchase our equity or debt securities, term loans or other debt instruments through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The execution of such retirements, redemptions or repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and/or other factors deemed relevant.

Income Taxes We have elected and believe we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to maintain our REIT status. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay (or are treated as paying) out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. Our real estate owned hotel portfolio is held in a TRS. Our TRS is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is taxed separately as a corporation. For financial reporting purposes, a provision or benefit for current and deferred taxes is established for the portion of earnings or expense recognized by us with respect to our TRS. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal income and excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject to material penalties as well as federal, state and local income tax on our REIT taxable income at regular corporate rates and we would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four full taxable years. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all REIT requirements. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements aside from those discussed in Note 3 - Loan Portfolio, Note 4 - Equity Method Investment, and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our Manager to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe that all of the decisions and estimates are reasonable, based upon the information available to us. We believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. The assumptions within our accounting policies may vary from quarter to quarter as our portfolio changes and market and economic conditions evolve. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Current Expected Credit Losses The CECL reserve required under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses , reflects our current estimate of potential credit losses related to our loan portfolio. Changes to the CECL reserve are recognized through a provision for or reversal of current expected credit loss reserve on our consolidated statements of operations. ASC 326 specifies the reserve should be based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current loan portfolio, market conditions and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts for the duration of each loan. For our loan portfolio, we perform a quantitative assessment of the impact of CECL using the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity, or WARM, method. The application of the WARM method to estimate a general CECL reserve requires judgment, including the appropriate historical loan loss reference data, the expected timing and amount of future loan fundings and repayments, the current credit quality of our portfolio, and our expectations of performance and market conditions over the relevant time period. The WARM method requires us to reference historical loan loss data from a comparable data set and apply such loss rate to each of our loans over their expected remaining duration, taking into consideration expected economic conditions over the forecasted timeframe. Our general CECL reserve reflects our forecast of the current and future macroeconomic conditions that may impact the performance of the commercial real estate assets securing our loans and the borrower s ultimate ability to repay. These estimates include unemployment rates, price indices for commercial properties, and market liquidity, all of which may influence the likelihood and magnitude of potential credit losses for our loans during their expected remaining duration. Additionally, further adjustments may be made based upon loan positions senior to ours, the risk rating of a loan, whether a loan is a construction loan, whether the loan s initial maturity is near-term, or the economic conditions specific to the property type of a loan s underlying collateral. 

 50 

To estimate an annual historical loss rate, we obtained historical loss rate data for loans most comparable to our loan portfolio from a commercial mortgage-backed securities database licensed by a third party, Trepp, LLC, which contains historical loss data from January 1, 1999 through September 30, 2024. We believe this CMBS data is the most relevant, available, and comparable dataset to our portfolio. When evaluating the current and future macroeconomic environment, we consider the aforementioned macroeconomic factors. Historical data for each metric is compared to historical commercial real estate credit losses in order to determine the relationship between the two variables. We use projections of each macroeconomic factor, obtained from a third party, to approximate the impact the macroeconomic outlook may have on our loss rate. Selections of these economic forecasts require judgment about future events that, while based on the information available to us as of the balance sheet date, are ultimately subjective and uncertain, and the actual economic conditions could vary significantly from the estimates we made. Following a reasonable and supportable forecast period, we use a straight-line method of reverting to the historical loss rate. Additionally, we assess the obligation to extend credit through our unfunded loan commitments through their expected remaining duration, adjusted for projected fundings from interest reserves, if applicable, which is considered in the estimate of the general CECL reserve. For both the funded and unfunded portions of our loans, we consider our internal risk rating of each loan as the primary credit quality indicator underlying our assessment. In certain circumstances we may determine that a loan is no longer suited for the WARM method due to its unique risk characteristics or where we have deemed the borrower/sponsor to be experiencing financial difficulty and the repayment of the loan s principal is collateral-dependent. We may instead elect to employ different methods to estimate credit losses that also conform to ASC 326 and related guidance. For such loan we would separately measure the specific reserve for each loan by using the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral. If the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral is less than the carrying value of the loan, an asset-specific reserve is created as a component of our overall current expected credit loss reserve. Specific reserves are equal to the excess of a loan s carrying value to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if recovery of our investment is expected from the sale of the collateral and such costs will reduce amounts recoverable by us. We evaluate the credit quality of each of our loans receivable on an individual basis and assign a risk rating at least quarterly. We have developed a loan grading system for all of our outstanding loans receivable that are collateralized directly or indirectly by real estate. Grading criteria include, but are not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized debt yield, term of loan, property type, property or collateral location, loan type, structure, collateral cash flow volatility and other more subjective variables that include, but are not limited to, as-is or as-stabilized collateral value, market conditions, industry conditions, borrower/sponsor financial stability, and borrower/sponsor exit plan. While evaluating the credit quality of each loan within our portfolio, we assess these quantitative and qualitative factors as a whole and with no pre-prescribed weight on their impact to our determination of a loan s risk rating. However, based upon the facts and circumstances for each loan and the overall market conditions, we may consider certain previously mentioned factors more or less relevant than others. We utilize the grading system to determine each loan s risk of loss and to provide a determination as to whether an individual loan is impaired and whether a specific CECL reserve is necessary. Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining credit loss reserves, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates. Real Estate Owned We may assume legal title and/or physical possession of the underlying collateral property of a defaulted loan through foreclosure, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or an assignment-in-lieu of foreclosure. We account for acquisitions of real estate, including foreclosures, deed-in-lieu of foreclosures, or assignment-in-lieu of foreclosures, in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , which first requires that we determine if the real estate investment is the acquisition of an asset or a business combination. Under this model, we identify and determine the estimated fair value of any assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This generally results in the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative estimated fair values of each respective asset and liability. Debt related to real estate owned is initially recorded at its estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or assignment-in-lieu of foreclosure. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally include land, building, building improvements, tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, mortgages payable, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, which generally consist of above or below market lease values, in-place lease values, and other lease-related values. In estimating fair values for allocating the purchase price of our real estate owned, we may utilize various methods, including a market approach, which considers recent sales of similar properties, adjusted for differences in location and state of the physical asset, or a replacement cost approach, which considers the composition of physical assets acquired, adjusted based on industry standard information and the remaining useful life of the acquired property. In estimating fair values of intangible assets acquired or liabilities assumed, we consider the estimated cost of leasing our real estate owned assuming the property was vacant, the value of the current lease agreements relative to market-rate leases, and the estimation of total lease-up time including lost rents. 

 51 

Real estate assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. Factors that we may consider in our impairment analysis include, among others: (1) significant underperformance relative to historical or anticipated operating results; (2) significant negative industry or economic trends; (3) costs necessary to extend the life or improve the real estate asset; (4) significant increase in competition; and (5) ability to hold and dispose of the real estate asset in the ordinary course of business. A real estate asset is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the real estate asset over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying amount of such real estate asset. Cash flows include operating cash flows and anticipated capital proceeds generated by the sale of the real estate asset. If the sum of such estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the real estate asset, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the real estate asset over its estimated fair value. When determining the estimated fair value of a real estate asset, we make certain assumptions including consideration of projected operating cash flows, comparable selling prices and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the real estate asset based upon our estimate of a capitalization rate and discount rate. There were no impairments of our real estate owned assets through September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk In early 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began a campaign to combat inflation by increasing interest rates, ultimately resulting in benchmark interest rates increasing by 5.25 by the end of 2023. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has reduced benchmark interest rates by 0.50 in recent months, such rates remain high relative to recent historical standards. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated that they may further reduce interest rates if inflation continues to decline towards their target range and/or if the employment market weakens. High benchmark interest rates imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve may continue to increase our interest expense, negatively impact the ability of our borrowers to service their debt, and reduce the value of the CRE collateral underlying our loans. Rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income. The following table illustrates as of September 30, 2024 the impact on our interest income and interest expense for loans receivable held-for-investment for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024 assuming a decrease in SOFR of 50 and 100 basis points and an increase in SOFR of 50 and 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate benchmark (based on SOFR of 4.85 as of September 30, 2024) in thousands, except per share data):

 Risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and asset values associated with movements in interest rates may also contribute to the risk of nonperformance on floating rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the cash flows of the collateral real estate assets to our loans may be insufficient to pay debt service due, which may contribute to nonperformance of, or in severe cases default on, our loans. We seek to manage this risk by, among other things, generally requiring our borrowers to acquire interest rate caps from an unaffiliated third-party. Credit Risk Our loans and other investments are also subject to credit risk, including the risk of default. In particular, changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, will affect the creditworthiness of borrowers and/or the value of underlying real estate collateral relating to our investments. By its very nature, our investment strategy emphasizes prudent risk management and capital preservation by primarily originating senior loans utilizing underwriting techniques requiring relatively conservative loan-to-value ratio levels to insulate us from credit losses absent a significant diminution in collateral value. In addition, we seek to manage credit risk by performing extensive due diligence on our collateral, borrower and guarantors, as applicable, evaluating, among other things, title, environmental and physical condition of collateral, comparable sales and leasing analysis of similar collateral, the quality of and alternative uses for the real estate collateral being underwritten, submarket trends, our borrower s track record and the reasonableness of the borrower s projections prior to originating a loan. Subsequent to origination, we also manage credit risk by proactively monitoring our investments and, whenever possible, limiting our own leverage to partial recourse or non-recourse, match-funding financing. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses in all circumstances. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the borrower s ability to improve and operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our Sponsor s asset management team monitors the performance of our loan portfolio and our Sponsor s asset management and origination teams maintain regular contact with borrowers, co-lenders and local market experts to monitor the performance of the underlying loan collateral, anticipate borrower, property and market issues and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, enforce our rights as the lender. In addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the CRE market, including variances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates and other macroeconomic factors (including interest rates) beyond our control. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting, loan structuring, financing structuring, and asset management processes. In the event that we are forced to foreclose, our broader Sponsor platform includes professionals experienced in CRE development, ownership, property management, and asset management which enables us to execute the workout of a troubled loan and protect investors capital in a way that we believe many non-traditional lenders cannot. 

 53 

Capital Markets Risks We are exposed to risks related to the equity and debt capital markets which impact our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other debt or equity-related instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our REIT taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to retain and accumulate operating earnings and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance the growth of our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by constantly monitoring the debt and equity capital markets, the maturity profile of our in-place loan portfolio and financings, and future funding requirements on our loan portfolio to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of any capital we may raise. Each of our repurchase agreements contain margin maintenance provisions, which allow the lender to require the delivery of cash or other assets to reduce the financing amount against loans that have been deemed to have experienced a diminution in value. A substantial deterioration in the commercial real estate capital markets may negatively impact the value of assets financed with lenders that have margin maintenance provisions in their facilities. Certain of our repurchase agreements permit valuation adjustments solely as a result of collateral-specific credit events, while other repurchase agreements contain provisions also allowing our lenders to make margin calls upon the occurrence of adverse changes in the capital markets or as a result of interest rate or spread fluctuations, subject to minimum thresholds, among other factors. As of September 30, 2024, we have not received any margin calls under any of our repurchase agreements. Financing Risk We finance our business through a variety of means, including the syndication of non-consolidated senior interests, notes payable, borrowings under our repurchase and participation facilities, the syndication of pari passu portions of our loans, the syndication of senior participations in our originated senior loans, and our secured term loan. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of financing in addition to these methods of financing. Weakness or volatility in the debt capital markets, the CRE and mortgage markets, changes in regulatory requirements, geopolitical volatility, and fluctuation in interest rates and the resulting market disruptions therefrom could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders or potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, increase the costs of or reduce the advance rate on existing financing or otherwise offer unattractive terms for that financing. In addition, we may seek to finance our business through the issuance of our common stock or other equity or equity-related instruments, though there is no assurance that such financing will be available on a timely basis with attractive terms, or at all. Counterparty Risk The nature of our business requires us to hold cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions, as well as obtain financing from various financial institutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under various contractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements with high credit-quality institutions. Our relationships with our lenders subject us to counterparty risks including the risk that a counterparty is unable to fund undrawn credit capacity, particularly if such counterparty enters bankruptcy, among other detrimental effects. We seek to manage this risk by diversifying our financing sources across counterparties and financing types and generally obtaining financing from high credit quality institutions. The nature of our loans and other investments also exposes us to the risk that our borrowers are unable to execute their business plans, and as a result do not make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates, as well as the impact of our borrowers tenants not making scheduled rent payments when contractually due. We seek to manage this risk through a comprehensive credit analysis prior to making an investment and rigorous monitoring of our borrowers progress in executing their business plans as well as market conditions that may affect the underlying collateral, through our asset management process. Each loan is structured with various lender protections that are designed to discourage and deter fraudulent behavior and other bad acts by borrowers, as well as require borrowers to adhere to their stated business plans while the loan is outstanding. Such protections may include, without limitation: cash management accounts, bad boy carveout guarantees, completion guarantees, guarantor minimum net worth and liquidity requirements, partial or full recourse to sponsors and/or guarantors, approval rights over major decisions, and performance tests throughout the loan term. Prepayment Risk Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid prior to initial maturity, which may require us to identify new investment opportunities to deploy such capital at a similar rate of return in order to avoid an overall reduction in our net interest income. We may structure our loans with spread maintenance, minimum multiples and make-whole provisions to protect against early repayment. Typically, investments are structured with the equivalent of 12 to 24 months spread maintenance or a minimum level of income that an investment is contractually obligated to return. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of deferred income, including origination fees and exit fees, which increases interest income earned on the asset during the period of repayment. Conversely, 

 54 

if capital that is repaid is not subsequently redeployed into investment opportunities generating a similar return, future periods may experience reduced net interest income. Repayment / Extension Risk Loans are generally expected to be repaid at maturity, unless the borrower repays early or meets contractual conditions to qualify for a maturity extension. The granting of these extensions may cause a loan s term to extend beyond the term of its related secured financing. Higher interest rates recently imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve may lead to an increase in the number of our borrowers who exercise or request additional extension options, or who may become unwilling or unable to make contractual payments when due. Some of our borrowers may experience delays in the execution of their business plans or changes in market conditions which may impact the performance of the underlying collateral asset, borrower, or sponsor. Accordingly, this may result in the borrower not meeting certain extension conditions such as minimum debt yield, maximum LTV, and/or the ability of the borrower to purchase replacement interest rate caps. Higher interest rates may also increase the number of our borrowers who may default because, among other things, they may not be able to find replacement financing for our loan. Furthermore, there may be certain instances where, for loans which have been modified, we may not be able to maintain the associated financing on its existing terms. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and in some situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. Currency Risk To date, we have made no loans and hold no assets or liabilities denominated or payable in foreign currencies, although we may do so in the future. We may in the future hold assets denominated or payable in foreign currencies, which would expose us to foreign currency risk. As a result, a change in foreign currency exchange rates may have a positive or an adverse impact on the valuation of our assets, as well as our income and dividends. Any such changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the measurement of such assets or income for the purposes of our REIT tests and may affect the amounts available for payment of dividends to our stockholders. Although not required, if applicable, we may hedge any currency exposures. However, such currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments and/or unequal, inaccurate or unavailability of hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Real Estate Risk The market values of loans secured directly or indirectly by CRE assets are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the interest rate environment; persistent inflation; increases in remote work trends; natural disasters or pandemics; national, regional, local and foreign economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); changes in social conditions; regional or local real estate conditions; geopolitical volatility, changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; changes to building or similar codes and government regulatory requirements (such as rent control and zoning laws); and changes in real property tax rates. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the loan collateral and the potential proceeds available and to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. We may realize losses related to foreclosures or to the restructuring of the loans in our investment portfolio on terms that may be more favorable to borrowers than those underwritten at origination. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting, loan structuring, financing structuring and asset management processes.

Item 4. Control s and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
