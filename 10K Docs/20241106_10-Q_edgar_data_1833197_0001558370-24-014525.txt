 Overview We are the largest designer, manufacturer, and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. We hold the leading position in North America in every product category in which we compete. It is our view that we are the most sought-after brand in the pool industry and the only pool company that has established a direct relationship with the homeowner. We are Latham, The Pool Company. With an operating history that spans over 65 years, we offer the industry s broadest portfolio of pools and related products, including in-ground swimming pools, pool liners, and pool covers. We have a heritage of innovation. In an industry that has traditionally marketed on a business-to-business basis (pool manufacturer to dealer), we pioneered the first direct-to-homeowner digital and social marketing strategy that has transformed the homeowner s purchase journey. Through this marketing strategy, we are able to create demand for our pools and to provide high quality, purchase-ready consumer leads to our dealer partners. Partnership with our dealers is integral to our collective success, and we have enjoyed long-tenured relationships averaging over 14 years. We support our dealer network with business development tools, co-branded marketing programs, and in-house training, as well as an operations platform consisting of approximately 1,850 employees across 30 locations. The full resources of our company are dedicated to designing and manufacturing high-quality pool products, with the homeowner in mind, and positioning ourselves as a value-added partner to our dealers. We conduct our business as one operating and reportable segment that designs, manufactures, and markets in-ground swimming pools, pool liners, and pool covers.

 Business Update Ongoing macroeconomic softness has impacted and is expected to continue to impact consumer spending and demand. As anticipated, this resulted in a decline in new in-ground residential pool installations in the first nine months of 2024. Within our in-ground pool product line, fiberglass pools continue to show strength relative to packaged pools. We continue to make progress executing our strategy to drive adoption and awareness of fiberglass pools and automatic safety covers and gain additional operating efficiencies through value engineering and lean manufacturing initiatives. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital investments, with the focus on the completion of previously announced projects such as our recent multi-year capital plan to invest in our facilities, technology and systems. Notably, this involves continued investment in our sales, marketing, engineering and research and development efforts that are designed to accelerate conversion to fiberglass pool products and ongoing digital transformation programs. As previously disclosed, we have responded to economic uncertainty by implementing cost reduction programs and lean manufacturing initiatives that structurally reduce our cost basis, while maintaining capacity. We believe that Latham s financial model has changed structurally, which has increased our underlying earnings capabilities amid an industry recovery. And we are increasing our investments in sales and marketing and product development initiatives to ensure that we capture an incremental share of in-ground pool sales once volumes rebound. Strategic Acquisition Strategic transactions continue to be part of our growth strategy. On August 2, 2024, we completed a stock acquisition (the Coverstar Central Acquisition of Coverstar Central, our exclusive dealer of automatic safety covers in 29 states mainly in the center of the U.S. Coverstar Central has been our trusted partner since 2006, and this acquisition represents a valuable strategic opportunity that we expect to benefit from in multiple ways. First, the vertical integration of our automatic safety cover product line in the acquired geographies is expected to increase margins. Second, as one company with a fully integrated sales and marketing strategy, we expect to accelerate the sales growth of this product line. Finally, we see opportunities to leverage Coverstar Central s long-standing relationships with pool builders in its markets to increase the awareness of, and conversion to, fiberglass pools. We believe the Coverstar Central Acquisition will be immediately accretive to our net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 and enhance our gross margins in the long-term. The cash purchase price was 64.0 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction was fully funded with cash on hand. Key Performance Indicators Net Sales We derive our revenue from the design, manufacture, and sale of in-ground swimming pools, pool covers, and pool liners. We sell fiberglass pools, which are one-piece manufactured fiberglass pools that are ready to be installed in a consumer s backyard, and custom vinyl pools, which are manufactured pools that are made out of non-corrosive steel, aluminum, or composite polymer frame, on top of which a vinyl liner is installed. We sell liners for the interior surface of vinyl pools (including pools that were not manufactured by us). We also sell all-season covers, which are winterizing mesh or solid pool covers that protect pools against debris and cold or inclement weather, and automatic safety covers for pools that can be operated with a switch. Our sales are made through one-step and two-step business-to-business distribution channels. In our one-step distribution channel, we sell our products directly to dealers who, in turn, sell our products to consumers. In our two-step distribution channel, we sell our products to distributors who warehouse our products and sell them on to dealers, who ultimately sell our products to consumers. Each product shipped is considered to be one performance obligation. With the exception of our extended service warranties and our custom product contracts, we recognize our revenue when control of our promised goods is transferred to our customers (dealer in one-step distribution channel or distributor in two-step distribution channel), either upon shipment or arrival at our customer s destination depending upon the terms of the purchase order. Sales are recognized net of any estimated rebates, returns, allowances, cash discounts, or other sales incentives. Revenue that is derived from our extended service warranties, which are separately priced and sold, is recognized over the term of the contracts. Revenue from custom products is recognized over time utilizing an input

 method that compares the cost of cumulative work-in-process to date to the most current estimates for the entire cost of the performance obligation. Gross Margin Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Gross margin depends upon several factors, such as the prices we charge buyers, changes in prices of raw materials, the volume and relative sales mix among product lines, and plant performance, among other factors. Gross margin is also impacted by the costs of distribution and occupancy costs, which can vary. Our gross profit is primarily variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales. The components of our cost of sales may not be comparable to the components of cost of sales or similar measures of other companies. As a result, our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key metrics used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are also frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, when considered alongside other GAAP measures. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to utilize as a significant performance metric in our incentive compensation plans, and to compare our performance against that of other companies using similar measures. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin solely as supplemental disclosures because we believe they allow for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, such as (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, net, (iii) income tax (benefit) expense, (iv) loss (gain) on sale and disposal of property and equipment, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, (vii) unrealized (gains) losses on foreign currency transactions, (viii) strategic initiative costs, (ix) acquisition and integration related costs, (x) the Odessa fire and other such unusual events and (xi) other. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in the future, and any such modification may be material. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin at all or may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently and accordingly, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies, which reduces the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as tools for comparison. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and the limitations on their use, and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA. Net Sales Net sales were 150.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 160.8 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 10.3 million, or 6.4 , decrease in net sales was because of a 9.5 million decrease in sales volume and a 0.8 million decrease from lower pricing. The sales volume decrease was primarily driven by continued soft industry conditions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. The decrease in net sales of 10.3 million across our product lines consisted of a decrease 8.1 million for in-ground swimming pools and 2.5 million for liners, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase for covers aided by the Coverstar Central acquisition. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin Cost of sales was 101.8 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 112.6 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased by 2.5 , to 32.4 of net sales for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 29.9 of net sales for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 10.8 million, or 9.6 , decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of the decrease in sales volume which in turn was partially offset by the impact of production efficiencies resulting from lean manufacturing and value engineering programs and lower material costs. The 2.5 increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of production efficiencies resulting from lean manufacturing and value engineering programs and procurement improvements that resulted in lower material costs and the acquisition of Coverstar Central.

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Selling, general, and administrative expense was 28.3 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 23.4 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 4.9 million, or 20.9 , increase in selling, general, and administrative expense was primarily driven by increased spending on sales and marketing to further strengthen our position ahead of a market turnaround, performance-based compensation and the acquisition of Coverstar Central, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Amortization Amortization was 7.0 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 6.6 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Our effective tax rate was (0.7) for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 52.1 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for both the fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and foreign income. Net Income Net income was 5.9 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 6.2 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 0.3 million, or 4.2 , decrease in net income was primarily because of the factors described above. Net Income Margin Net income margin was 3.9 for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 3.8 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 0.1 increase in net income margin was driven by the factors described above. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was 29.8 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, compared to 36.1 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 6.3 million, or 17.3 , decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily because of the decrease in cost of sales and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net sales, as well as the other factors described above.

 Net Sales Net sales were 421.2 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 475.6 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023. The 54.4 million, or 11.4 , decrease in net sales was because of a 51.7 million decrease in sales volume and a 2.7 million decrease from lower pricing. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by continued macroeconomic weakness and consisted of a decrease of 36.5 million for in-ground swimming pools, 9.1 million for liners and 8.8 million for covers. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin Cost of sales was 288.9 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 343.9 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased by 3.7 , to 31.4 of net sales for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 27.7 of net sales for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023. The 55.0 million, or 16.0 , decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of the decrease in sales volume, the impact of production efficiencies resulting from lean manufacturing and value engineering programs and lower material costs, partially offset by the acquisition of Coverstar Central. The 3.7 increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of previously announced restructuring programs, the impact of production efficiencies from lean manufacturing and value engineering programs, cost control, material deflation in line with expectations and supplier optimization. Deflation and supplier optimization partially offset the price decrease mentioned above. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Selling, general, and administrative expense was 81.2 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 86.7 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023.

Earnings from Equity Method Investment Earnings from our equity method investment in Premier Pools Spa were 2.8 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 2.5 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023, due to the financial performance of Premier Pools Spa. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was 0.9 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 8.6 million for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 7.6 for the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared to 140.7 for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for both the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and foreign income.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have their limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin: do not reflect every expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; do not reflect changes in our working capital needs; do not reflect the interest expense, or the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our outstanding debt; do not reflect income tax (benefit) expense, and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, tax expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate; do not reflect non-cash stock-based compensation, which will remain a key element of our overall compensation package; and do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. 
 Although depreciation and amortization are eliminated in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any costs of such replacements.

 Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our GAAP results, while using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as supplements to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. The following table provides a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Historically, we have funded working capital requirements, capital expenditures, payments related to acquisitions, and debt service requirements with internally generated cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, and the issuance of shares of our common stock. Our primary cash needs are to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, any acquisitions, or investments we may undertake, and any share repurchases we may make. As of September 28, 2024, we had 59.9 million of cash, 282.8 million of outstanding indebtedness and an additional 75.0 million of borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. On August 2, 2024, we completed the Coverstar Central Acquisition. The cash purchase price was 64.0 million, net of cash acquired. The Coverstar Central Acquisition was fully funded with cash on hand. While our existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities have generally been sufficient to fund our general corporate and working capital needs, our use of significant existing cash on hand to fund the Coverstar Central Acquisition may require us in the future to utilize a portion of our borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of inventory, payroll, rent, facility costs and other selling, general, and administrative costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the fiscal year, driven primarily by seasonality and the timing of raw material purchases. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to investments in lean manufacturing and value engineering, including production capacity, storage, and delivery equipment. We are in the midst of a multi-year capital plan to invest in our facilities, technology, and systems. We believe that our existing cash, cash generated from operations and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements over the next 12 months, as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. However, there can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current stockholders. Our Indebtedness On February 23, 2022, Latham Pool Products, Inc. Latham Pool Products ), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement (the Credit Agreement with Barclays Bank PLC, which provides a senior secured multicurrency revolving line of credit in an initial principal amount of 75.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility and a U.S. Dollar senior secured term loan (the Term Loan in an initial principal amount of 325.0 million. On such date, proceeds under the Credit Agreement were used to repay and replace 294.0 million under, and terminate, the previous credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan. Revolving Credit Facility The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized to finance ongoing general corporate and working capital needs and permits Latham Pool Products to borrow loans in U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros and Australian Dollars. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on February 23, 2027. Loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility denominated in U.S. Dollars and Canadian Dollars bear interest, at the borrower s option, at a rate per annum based on Term SOFR or CDO (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement), as applicable, plus a margin of 3.50 , or at a rate per annum based on the Base Rate or the Canadian Prime Rate (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin of 2.50 . Loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility denominated in Euros or Australian Dollars bear interest based on EURIBOR or the AUD Rate (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement), respectively, plus a margin of 3.50 . A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is due and payable quarterly in arrears, and initially was 0.375 per annum and thereafter accrues at a rate per annum ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 , depending on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Facility is not subject to amortization.

 We are also required to meet certain financial covenants, including maintaining specific liquidity measurements. There are also negative covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, consolidate, or merge with other entities, enter into transactions with affiliates, make prepayments with respect to certain indebtedness, make dividend payments, loans, or advances to the Company, declare dividends and make restricted payments and other distributions. As of September 28, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and 75.0 million was available for future borrowing. Term Loan The Term Loan matures on February 23, 2029. Loans outstanding under the Term Loan bear interest, at the borrower s option, at a rate per annum based on Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 3.75 to 4.00 , depending on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, or based on the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 2.75 to 3.00 , depending on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. Loans under the Term Loan are subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments equal to 0.25 of the initial principal amount of the Term Loan. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to that certain security agreement, which was executed in connection with the Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the guarantors tangible and intangible assets, including, but not limited to, their accounts receivables, equipment, intellectual property, inventory, cash and cash equivalents, deposit accounts and security accounts. The Credit Agreement also restricts payments and other distributions unless certain conditions are met, which could restrict our ability to pay dividends. As of September 28, 2024, we had 282.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan. Share Repurchase Program On May 10, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the Repurchase Program ), which authorizes us to repurchase up to 100 million of our shares of common stock by May 2025. We may effect these repurchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated purchases or other acquisitions. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our outstanding shares under the Repurchase Program and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on market conditions, our stock price, alternative uses of capital, the terms of our debt instruments and other factors. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, 77.0 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to our Repurchase Program. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 

Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 55,150 88,123 Net cash used in investing activities (77,907) (28,273) Net cash used in financing activities (20,198) (12,874) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 54 (1,489) Net (decrease) increase in cash (42,901) 45,487 Operating Activities During the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, operating activities provided 55.2 million of cash. Net income, after adjustments for non-cash items, provided cash of 60.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities was further driven by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, which used 5.2 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the

Table of Contents 
 three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 consisted primarily of a 35.6 million increase in trade receivables, a 6.6 million increase in income tax receivable, a 2.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a 0.6 million increase in other long-term liabilities, partially offset by a 25.5 million decrease in inventories, a 10.4 million increase in accounts payable, a 3.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and a 0.6 million decrease in other assets. The change in trade receivables was primarily driven by the timing of net sales, the change in inventories was driven by efforts to meet a reduced demand outlook while maintaining lead times and service levels and the changes in accounts payable were primarily driven by volume of purchases and timing of payments. During the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023, operating activities provided 88.1 million of cash. Net loss, after adjustments for non-cash items, provided cash of 56.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities was further driven by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, which provided 32.1 million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of a 61.7 million decrease in inventories, a 3.0 million increase in other long-term liabilities and a 2.1 million increase in accounts payable partially offset by a 28.7 million increase in trade receivables, a 4.3 million increase in other assets, a 1.5 million increase in income tax receivable, a 0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a 0.2 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The change in trade receivables was primarily driven by the timing of net sales, and the decrease in inventories was primarily driven by efforts to meet demand outlook while maintaining lead times and service levels. The changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable were primarily driven by volume of purchases and timing of payments Investing Activities During the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, investing activities used 77.9 million of cash, consisting of our acquisition of Coverstar Central for cash consideration of 64.0 million, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property and equipment for 13.9 million. The purchase of property and equipment was primarily to expand capacity for production and diversify offerings, especially for fiberglass pools, the majority of which relates to finishing up carryover projects from the prior fiscal year. During the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023, investing activities used 28.3 million of cash, consisting of purchases of property and equipment for 28.3 million. The purchase of property and equipment was primarily to expand capacity for production, especially for fiberglass pools. Financing Activities During the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, financing activities used 20.2 million of cash, primarily consisting of repayments on long-term debt borrowings of 19.6 million and repayments of finance lease obligations of 0.6 million. During the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023, financing activities used 12.9 million of cash, primarily consisting of repayments on revolving credit facilities of 48.0 million, repayments on long-term debt borrowings of 12.4 million, and repayments of finance lease obligations of 0.4 million, partially offset by borrowings on revolving credit facilities of 48.0 million. Contractual Obligations There have been no material changes, outside of the ordinary course of business, to our contractual obligations during the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 from those described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations in our Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Throughout the preparation of these financial statements, we have made estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below and under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report and Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates are based on historical results, trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from estimates.

 Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have selected the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing. We may assess our goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach, or step zero, to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment requires significant judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity s operating environment, its industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel, and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If management concludes, based on assessment of relevant events, facts, and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is greater than its carrying value, no further impairment testing is required. If our assessment of qualitative factors indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is performed. We may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with step zero. The quantitative analysis requires comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, there is an impairment of goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded. We calculate the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit less the carrying value, including goodwill. The maximum goodwill impairment is the carrying value of the goodwill. The qualitative factors we assessed as part of our annual impairment testing included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other entity specific events. In addition, we considered our market capitalization based on quoted market prices of our securities on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, adjusted for the effect of a control premium as contemplated by ASC 350. Based on the results of the quantitative assessment performed for our one reporting unit, we determined that goodwill was not impaired at October 1, 2023. However, if factors exist that could indicate an impairment in the future, including a sustained decrease in our stock price, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our business or with an existing or forecasted financial transaction. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through variable rate debt instruments and denominate some of our transactions in foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities. During the three fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the information included under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report.

 Interest Rate Risk We entered into an additional interest rate swap that was executed on March 10, 2023. The swap has an effective date of May 18, 2023 and a termination date of May 18, 2026. Under the terms of the swap, we fixed our SOFR borrowing rate on a notional amount of 161.0 million. The interest rate swap is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes. An increase or decrease of 1 in the effective interest rate, giving effect related to interest rate swaps, as of September 28, 2024, would cause an increase or decrease to annual interest expense, net of approximately 1.3 million. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 28, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Starting in the second quarter of 2024, as part of a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ERP system, the Company began utilizing certain aspects of the new ERP system. Eventually, this ERP system will replace the existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to its management team. The Company does not believe the changes implemented to date represent a material change in internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements related to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations and businesses, including, among others, contract and employment claims, personal injury claims, intellectual property claims, product liability claims and warranty claims. Currently, there are no claims or proceedings against us that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, no material legal proceedings were terminated, settled, or otherwise resolved during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024. However, the results of any current or future litigation cannot be

Table of Contents 
 predicted with certainty and, regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant costs and experience a diversion of management resources as a result of litigation. Item 1A. Risk Factors We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report, the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors set forth in the Annual Report and other subsequent reports we file or furnish with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, any of which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied. For similar reasons, our past results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and trends. You also should be aware that these risk factors and other information do not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may affect us. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time, and we anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. In addition, these risks do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, merger, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may undertake. Any of these known or emerging factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On May 10, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to 100.0 million of our shares of common stock by May 2025. We may effect these repurchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated purchases or other acquisitions. We are not obligated to repurchase any of our shares of our common stock under the program and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on market conditions, our stock price, alternative uses of capital, the terms of our debt instruments and other factors. As of September 28, 2024, 77.0 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to the repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Directors and Section 16 Officers During the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, none of the Company s directors or Section 16 officers or (i) any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or (ii) any trading arrangement.
