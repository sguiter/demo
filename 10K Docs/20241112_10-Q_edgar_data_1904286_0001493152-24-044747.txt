per share, is referred to as the Common Stock and the
Company s preferred stock, par value per share, is referred to as the Preferred Stock. 

Based
on the Company s discoveries and pre-clinical studies to date, the Company has decided to advance MIRA-55 as its lead compound
for the Company s oral pharmaceutical marijuana drug candidate while still retaining its rights to MIRA1a. As such, the Company
has decided not to move MIRA1a forward. 

million, and has used approximately million of cash in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Historically,
the Company has been primarily engaged in developing MIRA-55 and, more recently, has also been focusing on the development of Ketamir-2.
During these activities, the Company sustained substantial losses. The Company s ability to fund ongoing operations and future
pre-clinical and clinical trials required for FDA approval is dependent on the Company s ability to obtain significant additional
external funding in the near term. Since inception, the Company financed its operations through the sale of Common Stock, and related
party financings. The Company maintains an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of shares of common stock
under various types of equity offerings, including shares of common stock under our ATM equity program (Note 6). The Company expects
to be able to fund operations through the fourth quarter of 2025, with the cash on hand. However, the Company has the ability to issue
common stock under its shelf registration statement to assist in liquidity needs. 

The
Company expects to continue to generate losses in the foreseeable future. The Company s liquidity needs will be determined largely
by the budgeted operational expenditures incurred in regard to the progression of its product candidates. The Company does not have sufficient
cash and cash equivalents as of the date of filing this Report to support its operations for at least the 12 months following the date
the financial statements are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern through 12 months after the date the accompanying financial statements are issued.. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern 

million from MIRALOGX to fund the development of licensed products under the
License Agreement (the Loan ). 

Together
with any Advance Request, the Company shall deliver to the Lender a budget for the requested Advance (the Budget ). The
Budget may only include costs directly associated with preparing an Investigational New Drug IND application for Ketamir-2,
exclusive of personnel costs. Any Advances made by MIRALOGX to the Company pursuant to this Loan may be repaid by the Company (together
with any and all interest accrued thereon) at any time without penalty or premium in accordance with the terms hereof. Amounts repaid
under the Loan may not be reborrowed 

The
Loan Agreement has a one-year term, and all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest must be repaid in full on November
15, 2024. Interest on the amounts borrowed under the Loan Agreement accrues at an annual fixed rate of . The Company may prepay all
or a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest under the Loan Agreement at any time without a prepayment fee.
The Company has not borrowed any funds from the MIRALOGX loan as of September 30, 2024. 

Bay
Shore Trust 

In
April 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note and Loan Agreement with the Bay Shore Trust. Under this Promissory Note and Loan
Agreement (the Bay Shore Note ), the Company had the right to borrow up to an aggregate of million from the Bay Shore
Trust at any time up to the second anniversary of the issuance of the Bay Shore Note or, if earlier, upon the completion of the Company s
IPO. The Bay Shore Note accrued interest at a rate equal per annum, simple interest, during the first year that the note was outstanding. 

On
July 20, 2023, the Company entered into a conversion agreement with the Bay Shore Trust under which the Bay Shore Trust had converted,
at the time of the IPO, million of the outstanding principal balance of the Bay Shore Note into shares of Common Stock at a conversion
price equal to the price of the Common Stock sold to the public in the IPO, which resulted in the issuance of shares of Common
Stock to Bay Shore Trust. On August 14, 2023, the Company paid million in full to Bay Shore Trust, which was the amount due. The
Company also paid accrued interest of million. The remaining amount of million in accrued interest due to Bay Shore Trust
has been settled as of September 30 th , 2024. 

million for costs of shared management resources. 

Shared
management- Historically, the Company has shared management with related parties on an as-needed basis, to collaborate and pool resources
efficiently. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million in costs related to this arrangement which
is recorded in general and administrative expenses. Further, as of September 30, 2024, the Company is no longer sharing management with
related parties. 

Shared
lease costs - On April 1, 2023 the Company entered into an Agreement For Shared Lease Costs with MIRALOGX, LLC, (the Shared
Agreement who is a related party for the jet usage. Under the Shared Agreement, the Company agrees to make monthly contributions
or payments in accordance with its monthly use of shared aircraft toward rent payments. However, the Company has not used the aircraft
after the termination of the lease on March 31, 2023 and there are no minimum payments due without usage.

Variable

costs related to the aircraft include usage expenses, which includes pilot expenses, jet fuel and general flight expenses.

Total Lease Cost 

. On
September 24, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to amend the shelf registration statement to update the maximum amount
eligible to be sold under the ATM Agreement to million. As of September 30, 2024, under the ATM Agreement, the Company has sold 
shares of Common Stock at an average price per share of and received net proceeds of approximately million, after deducting
commissions and other fees of million. 

Stock-based
compensation 

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected
volatility, expected dividends, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected price volatility is based on the historical
volatilities of a peer group as the Company does not have a multi-year trading history for its shares. Industry peers consist of several
public companies in the biotech industry similar to the Company in size, stage of life cycle and product indications. The Company intends
to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information
regarding the volatility of the Company s own stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified
companies are no longer similar to the Company, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would
be utilized in the calculation. 

Expected
term of options granted is derived using the simplified method which computes expected term as the average of the sum of
the vesting term plus contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The
Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a total of options to purchase Common Stock, with an aggregate fair market value
of approximately million were granted to the members of the Company s Board of Directors, executive officers and consultants
of the Company. The options have exercise prices ranging from to and a term of years from the grant date. These option
vest over various terms ranging from immediate vesting upon grant to the one year anniversary of the grant date.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s
actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a
result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company s
other filings with the SEC. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements below. 

As
used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise indicated,
the terms the Company , we , us , our and similar terminology refer to MIRA Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. 

Background
of the Company 

We
are a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical development company with two neuroscience programs targeting a broad range of neurologic and
neuropsychiatric disorders. We hold exclusive license rights in the U.S., Canada and Mexico for Ketamir-2 , a novel, patent pending
oral ketamine analog under pre-clinical investigation to potentially deliver ultra-rapid antidepressant effects, providing hope for individuals
battling NP, TRD, MDSI and potentially PTSD. 

Additionally,
our novel oral pharmaceutical marijuana molecule, MIRA-55 , is being studied for its potential to alleviate neuropathic pain, as
well as anxiety and cognitive decline, symptoms commonly associated with early-stage dementia. MIRA-55, if approved by the FDA, could
mark a significant advancement in addressing various neuropsychiatric, inflammatory, and neurologic diseases and disorders. 

The
DEA s scientific review of Ketamir-2 and MIRA-55 concluded that neither would be considered a controlled substance or listed chemical
under the CSA and its governing regulations. 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in September 2020 and commenced substantive operations, including our pharmaceutical
development program, in late 2020. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

See
Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a summary of significant accounting
policies and information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the three months ended September 30 ,
2024 compared to the three months ended September 30 , 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 1.1 million in research and development
expenses, which were primarily related to initial payments for pre-clinical research projects. We incurred 1.0 million in research and
development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023, relating to initial payment for toxicology study costs. Research
and development expenses include pre-clinical, toxicology and consultant expenses. 

10 

General
and Administrative Expenses . We incurred 1.0 million and 2.1 million in general and administrative expenses during the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses are composed primarily of compensation,
insurance, professional fees, stock-based compensation, administration and other related costs. The decrease is primarily due to stock-based
compensation, debt issuance costs, and compensation related to the IPO efforts of the executive team that occurred in 2023 and is not
reoccurring. 

Interest
income (expense), net . We earned 0.04 million in interest income (expense), net during the three months ended September 30, 2024
and incurred (0.43) million interest income (expense), net during the three months September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest income
in during 2024 related primarily to money market account interest whereas interest expense during 2023 included 0.44 million of debt
issuance costs and 0.02 million of interest income. 

For
the nine months ended September 30 ,
2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30 , 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 2.4 million in research and development expenses
which were primarily related to initial payments for pre-clinical research projects. We incurred 1.2 million in research and development
expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, relating to initial payments for several toxicology projects. Research and
development expenses include pre-clinical, toxicology and consultant expenses and we expect our 2024 costs to be consistent going forward. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. We incurred general and administrative expenses of 3.1 million and 3.8 million during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses consists of payroll, consulting fees,
IT-related costs, legal and accounting costs, office and rent expenses, investor relations and stock-based compensation expenses. The
decrease is due primarily to stock-based compensation, debt issuance costs, and compensation related to the IPO efforts of the executive
team that occurred in 2023. We would expect our 2024 costs to be consistent going forward. 

Related
Party Travel Costs . We incurred no in related party travel costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5
million in September 30, 2023. The related party travel costs incurred in 2023 consisted of a lease and use of an airplane with an entity
under common control. The airplane lease was terminated in March 2023 and no further costs are expected to be incurred. 

Interest
income (expense), net . We earned 0.13 million in interest income (expense), net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and incurred 0.73 million in interest income (expense), net during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest
expense during 2023 included 0.74 million of debt issuance costs and 0.02 million of interest income. Whereas in 2024 the Company earned
 0.13 million in interest income from to money market accounts. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception in September 2020, we have financed our operations primarily through an unsecured line of credit with a major shareholder
and an affiliated company, through a private placement of shares of our common stock that occurred during the fourth quarter 2021 and
during 2022, by the proceeds from our completed initial public offering in August 2023 and through the proceeds of an ATM offering during
the third quarter of 2024. We intend to finance our clinical development programs and working capital needs from existing cash, and potentially
new sources of debt and equity financing. We may enter into new licensing and commercial partnership agreements. 

Historically,
we have been primarily engaged in developing MIRA-55 and, more recently, have also been focusing on the development of Ketamir-2. During
these activities, we have sustained substantial losses. Our ability to fund ongoing operations and future pre-clinical and clinical trials
required for FDA approval is dependent on our ability to obtain significant additional external funding in the near term. We expect to
be able to fund operations through the fourth quarter of 2025, with the issuance of common stock under our shelf registration as described
in Note 7 of the accompanying financial statements. 

11 

On
August 12, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The terms of any offering under the shelf
registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the
SEC prior to completion of any such offering. 

We
expect to continue to generate losses in the foreseeable future. Our liquidity needs will be determined largely by the budgeted operational
expenditure incurred in regard to the progression of our product candidates. We do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents as of
the date of filing this Report to support our operations for at least 12 months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern through 12 months after the date the financial statements included in this Report are issued.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and therefore are not required to provide the information
under this item per Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K. 

12 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer)
(the Certifying Officers ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s
management, including its principal executive and principal accounting officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Certifying officers have concluded, based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Report that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met. Management is in process of implementing
plans to remediate the ineffectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures through enhancements to its internal control environment
as more fully described below. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
2024, the Company has designed and implemented new and enhanced controls to strengthen the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting, including hiring additional experienced accounting personnel, among other enhancements. Management believes these enhancements
will be sufficient to remediate previously identified material weaknesses. However, the new and enhanced controls have not operated for
a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Other
than as described above, there were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, 
 will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, 
 target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential , or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. In particular, statements
about the markets in which we operate, including growth of our various markets, and our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives,
prospects, assumptions, or future events or performance contained in this quarterly report under the headings Risk Factors, 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business 
are forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and
projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements
are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These and other important
factors, including those discussed in this quarterly report under the headings Risk Factors, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business, may cause our actual results,
performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements, or could affect our share price. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially
from those expressed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 

our use of the net proceeds from our offerings; 

13 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidates; 

our ability to successfully commercialize and market our product candidates, if approved; 

our ability to contract with third-party suppliers, manufacturers and other service providers and their ability to perform adequately; 

the potential market size, opportunity, and growth potential for our product candidates, if approved; 

our ability to obtain additional funding for our operations and development activities; 

the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

the initiation, timing, progress and results of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and our research and development programs; 

the timing of anticipated regulatory filings; 

the timing of availability of data from our clinical trials; 

our future expenses, capital requirements, need for additional financing, and the period over which we believe that the net proceeds
from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements; 

our ability to retain the continued service of our key professionals and to identify, hire and retain additional qualified professionals; 

our ability to advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials; 

our ability to recruit and enroll suitable patients in our clinical trials; 

the timing or likelihood of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development objectives; 

the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved; 

the rate and degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved; 

the implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business, product candidates, and technology; 

the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates and technology; 

developments relating to our competitors and our industry; 

the development of major public health concerns, including the novel coronavirus outbreak or other pandemics arising globally, and the
future impact of it and COVID-19 on our clinical trials, business operations and funding requirements; and 

other risks and factors listed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this quarterly report. 

14 

Given
the risks and uncertainties set forth in this quarterly report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report are not guarantees of future performance and our actual
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially
from the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and events in the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly
report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. 

Any
forward-looking statement that we make in this quarterly report speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by federal
securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this quarterly report. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions,
administrative actions, investigations, or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

We
anticipate that we will expend significant financial and managerial resources in the defense of our intellectual property rights in the
future if we believe that our rights have been violated. We also anticipate that we will expend significant financial and managerial
resources to defend against claims that our products and services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various
risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary
materially from recent results or our anticipated future results. 

We
expect to rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including
failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements or our pre-clinical protocols. 

We
currently rely on contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct our pre-clinical trials, as we currently do not plan to independently
conduct pre-clinical trials of any of our product candidates. Our agreements with these CROs, and other third parties might terminate
for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we were ever to need to enter into alternative arrangements
or if we were to need to change a CRO for an ongoing pre-clinical trial, we might experience delays in our pre-clinical development activities 

Geopolitical
events and global economic conditions, such as the Israel-Hamas war may impact our third parties that we engage to supply any materials
or to manufacture any products for our preclinical tests and clinical trials, which increases the risk of potential delay of development
efforts, as applicable. 

If
the third parties that we engage to supply any materials or to manufacture any products for our preclinical tests and clinical trials
should cease to continue to do so for any reason, including due to the effects of global economic conditions, including the Israel-Hamas
war, we likely would experience delays in advancing these tests and trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers or manufacturers
and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate
supplies of our product, or the substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product, and compete
effectively. 

15 

Our
current and anticipated dependence upon third-party suppliers may adversely affect our ability to develop our product, and product candidates
and could delay our clinical trials and development programs as well as marketing and commercialization efforts, and otherwise harm our
operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
