theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), as a basis for allocating resources and assessing performance. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the Company s theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has reportable segment.

Deferred revenue, short-term portion 

The Company estimates approximately million of the deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of December 31, 2023 was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For certain admission products, the Company estimated timing of redemption using average historical redemption rates. International Agreements In May 2023, SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, the first SeaWorld branded park outside the United States, opened on Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates (the "Middle East Project"). The first-of-its-kind marine life themed park was built through a partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC. As part of this partnership, the Company receives sales based royalties, certain incentive fees and other service based payments. Additionally, the Company provided certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. Revenue and expenses associated with the above items (collectively the Middle East Agreements began to be recognized when substantially all the services had been performed which occurred when SeaWorld Abu Dhabi opened in May 2023. The Company also received additional funds, some of which were advanced, from its partner related to agreed-upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by the Company on behalf of the Middle East Project (the Middle East Services Agreements ). Revenue and expenses associated with the Middle East Services Agreements were recognized upon completion of the respective performance obligations and have no further obligations as of December 31, 2023.

Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards 

Diluted earnings per share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock awards). Unvested restricted stock awards are eligible to receive dividends, if any; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of formerly restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding.

 and anti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were approximately and anti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. The Company s outstanding performance-vesting restricted awards of approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. 

 and , respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates over these periods differ from the effective statutory federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes and limits on certain compensation deductibility, partially offset by a tax benefit related to equity-based compensation which vested during the period. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit from deferred tax assets, tax positions are reviewed at least quarterly by assessing future expected taxable income from all sources. Realization of deferred tax assets, primarily arising from net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards. Based on its analysis, the Company believes that some of its deferred tax assets may not be realized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s valuation allowance consisted of approximately million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision (benefit) in the applicable period. The Inflation Reduction Act IRA of 2022 was signed into law on August 16, 2022. This legislation includes a corporate alternative minimum tax and a excise tax on stock repurchases among its key tax provisions effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company accrued approximately million for an expected excise tax related to shares repurchases made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest above primarily relates to interest associated with the Company s senior notes issued in August 2021, for which interest is paid bi-annually in February and August. As of December 31, 2023 , accrued interest above also includes interest associated with the Company s first-priority senior secured notes issued in April 2020, which were fully redeemed in May 2024, for which interest was paid bi-annually in November and May.

The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes were scheduled to mature on and had interest payment dates of May 1 and November 1. See additional discussion regarding the full redemption of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes in the preceding Refinancing Transactions section. Restrictive Covenants The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the Debt Agreements ), contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company, SEA and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) make dividend payments on or make other distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) sell certain assets; (v) create or permit to exist dividend and/or payment restrictions affecting their restricted subsidiaries; (vi) create liens on assets; (vii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions and are based, in part on the Company s ability to satisfy certain tests and engage in certain transactions based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from Adjusted EBITDA due to certain adjustments permitted under the relevant agreements, including but not limited to estimated cost savings, recruiting and retention costs, public company compliance costs, litigation and arbitration costs and other costs and adjustments as permitted under the Debt Agreements. The Debt Agreements contain certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Debt Agreements will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Debt Agreements and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the Debt Agreements. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company, subject to a testing threshold, comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum net first lien leverage ratio of to . The testing threshold will be satisfied (and therefore the covenant must be complied with at the end of such quarter) if the aggregate amount of funded loans and issued letters of credit (excluding up to million of undrawn letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit that are cash collateralized) under the Revolving Credit Facility on such date exceeds an amount equal to of the then-outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved million shares of common stock for issuance under its Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Incentive Plan ), of which approximately million shares are available for future issuance as of September 30, 2024. Bonus Performance Restricted Units During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted approximately performance-vesting restricted units (the Bonus Performance Restricted Units in accordance with its annual bonus plan for 2024 (the 2024 Bonus Plan ). The 2024 Bonus Plan provides for bonus awards payable in cash and in performance-vesting restricted units (the Bonus Performance Restricted Units and is based upon the Company s achievement of specified performance goals, as defined by the 2024 Bonus Plan, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2024 Fiscal 2024 ). The total number of units eligible to vest into shares of stock is based on the level of achievement of the targets for Fiscal 2024 which ranges from (if below threshold performance), to (if at target performance) with opportunities to earn above 100 when achievement is above the target performance for certain metrics. The Company had an annual bonus plan for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 Fiscal 2023 ), under which certain employees were eligible to vest in Bonus Performance Restricted Units based upon the Company s achievement of certain performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2023. Based on the Company s actual Fiscal 2023 results, a portion of these Bonus Performance Restricted Units vested and were converted into approximately shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the remaining unvested units forfeited in accordance with their terms. Long-term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted long-term incentive plan awards for 2024 (the 2024 Long-Term Incentive Grant which were comprised of approximately nonqualified stock options (the Long-Term Incentive Options and approximately performance-vesting restricted units (the Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units (collectively, the Long-Term Incentive Awards ).

 (if below threshold performance) up to (for maximum performance). Upon achievement of at least the threshold performance goals, 50 of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50 subject to a one-year performance test period. Performance for the test period must meet or exceed the prior year s performance before up to the remaining of the units can be earned. Other During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a portion of the previously granted long-term incentive performance restricted units under the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan vested based on the Company s actual Fiscal 2023 results. The remainder of the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan awards were forfeited in accordance with their terms. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period, if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting changes for performance-vesting restricted awards in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded, if any, over the requisite service period had the new percentage been applied from inception, will be recorded as a cumulative catch-up or reduction at such subsequent date. 

 shares of common stock were issued in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, which includes shares of treasury stock held by the Company (see Share Repurchase Programs discussion which follows) but excludes unvested restricted stock awards held by certain participants in the Company s equity compensation plans or members of the Board (see Note 9 Equity-Based Compensation). Share Repurchase Programs In August 2022, the Board approved a new million share repurchase program (the Former Share Repurchase Program of which approximately million remained available as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares for an aggregate total of approximately million, leaving approximately million remaining under the Former Share Repurchase Program as of September 30, 2024. In March 2024, the Company announced that its Stockholders and Board of Directors approved a new million share repurchase program (the "Share Repurchase Program"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares for an aggregate total of approximately million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 through November 6, 2024, the Company repurchased shares for an aggregate total of approximately million, leaving approximately million remaining under the Share Repurchase Program as of November 6, 2024. Collectively, under the 2022 Former Share Repurchase Program and 2024 Share Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased shares for an aggregate total of approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Under the Former Share Repurchase Program and Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Former Share Repurchase Program and Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Company s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including legal requirements, share ownership thresholds, debt covenant restrictions, future tax implications and alternative investment opportunities.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 References to our theme parks or parks in the discussion that follows includes all of our separately gated parks. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Introduction 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should also be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, and the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Business Overview 
 We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 13 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States and in the United Arab Emirates. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. 
 Recent Developments 
 Current Operating Environment 
 Our Board has formed a number of committees and holds certain meetings and operational review sessions on a frequent basis designed to provide further assistance from Board members with expertise in certain areas by providing enhanced oversight over the operations of the Company. As a result, in the current operating environment, certain members of our Board, including our Chairman of the Board, are actively involved in overseeing certain key operating activities and decisions. 
 While conditions have improved in some markets and for various positions, the current condition of the overall labor market and the challenging current operating environment have led to turnover and hiring challenges for some positions and/or markets which could impact operations and the guest experience. 
 Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual passes (which generally expire after a 12-month term), season passes (including our fun card products and, collectively with annual passes, referred to as passes or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Revenue from these admissions products are generally recognized based on attendance. Certain pass products are purchased through monthly installment arrangements which allow guests to pay over the product s initial commitment period. Once the initial commitment period is reached, some of these products transition to a month-to-month basis providing these guests access to specific parks on a monthly basis with related revenue recognized monthly, while others can renew for a full commitment period. 
 22 

Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: 
 Admission Per Capita. We calculate admission per capita as total admissions revenue divided by total attendance. Admission per capita is primarily driven by ticket pricing, the admissions product mix (including the impact of pass visitation rates), and the park attendance mix, among other factors. The admissions product mix, also referred to as the attendance or visitation mix, is defined as the mix of attendance by ticket category such as single day, multi-day, annual/season passes or complimentary tickets/passes and can be impacted by the mix of guests, as domestic and international guests generally purchase higher admission per capita ticket products than local guests. A higher mix of attendance from complimentary tickets/passes will lower admissions per capita. Pass visitation rates are the number of visits per pass. A higher number of visits per pass, including complimentary passes, would yield a lower admissions per capita as the revenue is recognized over more visits. The park attendance mix is defined as the mix of theme parks visited and can impact admission per capita based on the theme park s respective pricing which, on average, is lower for our water parks compared to our other theme parks. 

In-Park Per Capita Spending. We calculate in-park per capita spending as total food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, merchandise, retail, parking, other in-park products and service fees, and other miscellaneous revenue, including online transaction fees and revenue from our international agreements, not necessarily generated in our parks, which is not significant in the periods presented. In-park per capita spending is primarily driven by pricing, product offerings, the mix of guests (as domestic and international guests typically generate higher in-park per capita spending than local guests or pass holders), guest penetration levels (percentage of guests purchasing) and the mix of in-park spending, among other factors. 

Total revenue per capita, admissions per capita and in-park per capita spending are key performance metrics that we use to assess the operating performance of our parks on a per attendee basis and to make strategic operating decisions. We believe the presentation of these performance metrics is useful and relevant for investors as it provides investors the ability to review operating performance in the same manner as our management and provides investors with a consistent methodology to analyze revenue between periods on a per attendee basis. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used similar per-capita related performance metrics to evaluate companies in the industry. 
 See further discussion in the Results of Operations section which follows and in Note 1 Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Attendance 
 The level of attendance in our theme parks is generally a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, marketing and sales efforts, awareness and type of ticket and park offerings, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence, the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. The external perceptions of our brands and reputation have at times impacted relationships with some of our business partners, including certain ticket resellers that have terminated relationships with us and other zoological-themed attractions. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Historically, the principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, driven partly by staffing levels, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities, property taxes and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include fixed operating costs, competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, park operating hours, new parks and/or incremental operating days, new and/or enhanced events, attendance levels, supply chain issues, and inflationary pressures, among other factors. The mix of products sold compared to the prior year period can also impact our costs as retail products generally have a higher cost of sales component than our food and beverage or other in-park offerings. 
 We have a dedicated team of employees and consultants focused on reducing costs and improving operating margins and streamlining our labor structure to better align with our strategic business objectives. We have spent significant time reviewing our operations and have identified meaningful cost savings opportunities, including technology initiatives, which we believe will further strengthen our business and, in some instances, improve guest experiences. 
 See the Current Operating Environment section for further details. For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. 
 23 

Seasonality 
 The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because four of our theme parks were historically only open for a portion of the year. As a result, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues were historically generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incurred a net loss in the first quarter. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our eight theme parks which have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks and/or start dates could also impact attendance patterns. Any changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our historically seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. 
 See Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC.

Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.8 million, or 0.9 , to 297.0 million as compared to 299.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was a result of a decrease in attendance, partially offset by an increase in admission per capita. Total attendance for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 100 thousand guests, or 1.4 , compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease in attendance was primarily due to a negative calendar shift and meaningfully worse weather, including related to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, during peak visitation periods, compared to the prior year quarter. Admission per capita increased by 0.19 to 42.24 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 42.05 in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the net impact of the park mix, partially offset by lower pricing on certain promotional admission products compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Food, merchandise and other revenue. Food, merchandise and other revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million, or 0.2 , to 248.9 million as compared to 248.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of an increase in in-park per capita spending, partially offset by a decrease in attendance, as discussed above. In-park per capita spending increased by 1.6 to 35.42 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 34.85 in the third quarter of 2023. In park per capita spending improved primarily due to pricing initiatives compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.2 million, or 0.5 , to 40.6 million as compared to 40.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 million, or 0.7 , to 207.3 million as compared to 205.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs and a 2.6 million increase in third-party consulting costs associated with nonrecurring strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash fixed asset write-offs compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.3 million, or 7.3 , to 55.4 million as compared to 59.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a 6.6 million decrease in third-party consulting costs, including approximately 4.2 million of nonrecurring costs for strategic initiatives, partially offset by an increase in marketing related costs compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.4 million, or 6.1 , to 41.6 million as compared to 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to new asset additions, partially offset by the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million, or 7.1 , to 39.7 million as compared to 37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to the net impact of the Refinancing Transactions which included a higher average outstanding balance on our variable debt, partially offset by a lower average outstanding balance on our fixed debt. See Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 41.6 million compared to 42.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 25.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily impacted due to state income taxes and limits on certain compensation deductibility.

 Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.8 million, or 0.9 , to 726.8 million as compared to 733.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was a result of a decrease in admissions per capita, partially offset by an increase in attendance. Total attendance for the first nine months of 2024 increased by approximately 20 thousand guests, or 0.1 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase in attendance was primarily due to an increase in demand, partially offset by the impact of significantly worse weather and hurricanes, particularly at our Florida parks, including during peak visitation periods compared to the first nine months of 2023. Admission per capita decreased by 1.0 to 43.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower pricing on certain promotional admission products compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Food, merchandise and other revenue. Food, merchandise and other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.1 million, or 1.7 , to 614.2 million as compared to 604.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in in-park per capita spending and an increase in attendance, as discussed above. In-park per capita spending increased by 1.5 to 36.85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In park per capita spending improved primarily due to pricing initiatives compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million, or 0.5 , to 102.3 million as compared to 101.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 11.8 million, or 2.1 , to 562.4 million as compared to 574.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to a decrease in non-cash fixed asset write-offs and a decrease in nonrecurring legal costs and contractual liabilities resulting from the previously disclosed temporary COVID-19 park closures compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 26 

Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.1 million, or 5.2 , to 167.0 million as compared to 176.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a 17.9 million decrease in third-party consulting costs, including approximately 14.3 million of nonrecurring costs for strategic initiatives, and a decrease in labor-related costs, partially offset by an increase in marketing related costs compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.6 million, or 5.8 , to 121.0 million as compared to 114.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to new asset additions, partially offset by the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.4 million, or 6.7 , to 117.8 million as compared to 110.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to the net impact of the Refinancing Transactions which included a higher average outstanding balance on our variable debt and write-offs of discounts and debt issuance costs, partially offset by a lower average outstanding balance on our fixed debt. See Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to a write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts resulting from the Refinancing Transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 67.6 million compared to 65.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 25.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily impacted by state income taxes and limits on certain compensation deductibility, partially offset by a tax benefit related to equity-based compensation which vested during the period. See Note 4 Income Taxes in our notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Generally, our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash typically include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), share repurchases and/or other return of capital to stockholders, when permitted. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 0.6. We typically have operated with a working capital ratio of near 1.0 due to a significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that result in limited inventory balances. We believe our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facility, will allow us to meet our liquidity needs. 
 As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we or our affiliates, may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. 
 Share Repurchases 
 See Note 10 Stockholders Deficit in our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our share repurchase programs. 
 Other 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, debt service obligations and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months.

The change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily impacted by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 222.2 million largely related to future attractions. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 234.2 million of capital expenditures. 
 The following table presents detail of our capital expenditures for the periods indicated. Certain amounts relating to prior period results were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of the prior period.

 The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. Historically, we generally expect to fund our capital expenditures through our operating cash flow. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily results from 445.3 million used to repurchase shares, repayments of 238.2 million on long-term debt and 8.6 million for payments of tax withholdings on equity-based compensation through shares withheld, partially offset by 379.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of debt . Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 results primarily from share repurchases of 17.9 million, repayments of 9.0 million on our long-term debt, and payment of tax withholdings on equity-based compensation through shares withheld of 6.6 million 
 Our Indebtedness 
 We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. As of September 30, 2024, our indebtedness consisted of senior secured credit facilities and 5.25 senior notes (the Senior Notes ). 
 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 SeaWorld Parks Entertainment, Inc. SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, as amended and restated pursuant to a credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated August 25, 2021 (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ). 
 28 

As of September 30, 2024, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of 1.542 billion in Term B-2 Loans which will mature in August 2028, along with a 700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which had no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and will mature on the earlier of (x) August 23, 2029 and (y) May 26, 2028, if at least 225,000,000 of Term B-2 Loans (or any debt refinancing, refunding or replacing any Term B-2 Loans that mature on or prior to November 22, 2029) are outstanding on the date that is 91 days prior to the Term B-2 Loans maturity date of August 25, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, SEA had approximately 17.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately 682.5 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, SEA had outstanding 725.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due on August 15, 2029. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants in our credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. 
 See Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details related to our long-term debt and restrictive covenants. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus (i) income tax provision, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) interest expense, consent fees and similar financing costs, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) equity-based compensation expense, (vi) certain non-cash charges/credits including those related to asset disposals and self-insurance reserve adjustments, (vii) certain business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs, (viii) merger, acquisition, integration and certain investment costs, and (ix) other nonrecurring costs including incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar unusual events. 
 Under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the Debt Agreements ), our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing certain indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Debt Agreements Covenant Adjusted EBITDA ). 
 Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus certain other items as defined in the Debt Agreements, including estimated cost savings among other adjustments. Cost savings represent annualized estimated savings expected to be realized over the following 24 month period related to certain specified actions including restructurings and cost savings initiatives, net of actual benefits realized during the last twelve months. Other adjustments include (i) recruiting and retention costs, (ii) public company compliance costs, (iii) litigation and arbitration costs, and (iv) other costs and adjustments as permitted by the Debt Agreements. 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company s underlying operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. In addition, we believe the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Debt Agreements. See Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details relating to our restrictive covenants. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of income or loss from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation.

 (g)	Reflects the impact of expenses, net of insurance recoveries and adjustments, incurred primarily related to certain matters, which we are permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. 
 30 

(h)	Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items as described above. 
 (i)	Our Debt Agreements permit the calculation of certain covenants to be based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings we expect to realize over the following 24-month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Debt Agreements and does not impact our reported GAAP net income. 
 (j)	The Debt Agreements permit our calculation of certain covenants to be based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for certain costs as permitted by the Debt Agreements including recruiting and retention expenses, public company compliance costs and litigation and arbitration costs, if any. 
 (k)	Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Debt Agreements as Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings among other adjustments as described in footnotes (i) and (j) above. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K other than the debt and interest obligations pursuant to the Refinancing Transactions (see Note 6 Long-Term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details). As a result, our total long-term debt obligations as of September 30, 2024, not including any possible prepayments, are as follows for the remainder of 2024, 2025-2026, 2027-2028, and thereafter, respectively (in thousands): 3,885; 31,080; 1,507,333; and 725,000. Our estimated future interest payments based on interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024 are as follows for the remainder of 2024, 2025-2026, 2027-2028, and thereafter, respectively (in thousands): 38,975; 308,027; 266,657; and 26,894. Includes amounts attributable to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes calculated as of September 30, 2024 using certain assumptions and excluding any possible principal prepayments. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting estimates associated with these policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on February 29, 2024 .

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Inflation 
 The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. The costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, other costs, such as the costs of fuel, construction, repairs and maintenance, labor, freight, utilities and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures. For further discussion, see the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. 
 31 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 
 Prior to 2021, we previously managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fixed a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. We have no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We presently manage interest rate risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding. At September 30, 2024, approximately 1.5 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately 700.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in Adjusted Term SOFR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 22.4 million. Assuming no revolving credit borrowings, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in Adjusted Term SOFR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 15.4 million. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), require public companies, including us, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures by our management as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The cash compensation and equity grants described in this Policy will be paid or made, as applicable, automatically and without further action of the Board, to each Outside Director. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Policy will have the meaning given such terms in the Company s 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan ).
