CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks known to us, significant uncertainties, and other factors
which may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. 

Some
of the statements used in this report constitute forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs, projections and
predictions about future events. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements
that refer to plans, intentions, objectives, goals, targets, strategies, hopes, beliefs, projections, prospects, expectations or other
characterizations of future events or performance, and assumptions underlying the foregoing. The words may, could, 
 should, would, will, project, intend, continue, believe, 
 anticipate, estimate, forecast, expect, plan, potential, 
 opportunity, scheduled, goal, target, and future, variations of
such words, and other comparable terminology and similar expressions and references to future periods are often, but not always, used
to identify forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the
following: 

our
 prospects, including our future business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, gross margins, profitability, cash
 flows, cash position, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, backlog of orders and revenue, our targeted growth
 rate, our goals for future revenues and earnings, and our expectations about realizing the revenues in our backlog and in our sales
 pipeline; 

the
 effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations of current and future economic, business, market and regulatory
 conditions, including the current economic and market conditions and their effects on our customers and their capital spending and
 ability to finance purchases of our products, services, technologies and systems; 

the
 effects of fluctuations in sales on our business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, margins, profitability, cash
 flows, capital expenditures, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations; 

our
 products, services, technologies, and systems, including their quality and performance in absolute terms and as compared to competitive
 alternatives, their benefits to our customers and their ability to meet our customers requirements, and our ability to successfully
 develop and market new products, services, technologies and systems; 

our
 markets, including our market position and our market share; 

our
 ability to successfully develop, operate, grow and diversify our operations and businesses; 

our
 business plans, strategies, goals and objectives, and our ability to successfully achieve them; 

the
 sufficiency of our capital resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, availability of borrowings
 under our credit and financing arrangements and other capital resources, to meet our future working capital, capital expenditure,
 lease and debt service and business growth needs; 

the
 value of our assets and businesses, including the revenues, profits and cash flows they are capable of delivering in the future; 

the
 effects on our business operations, financial results, and prospects of business acquisitions, combinations, sales, alliances, ventures
 and other similar business transactions and relationships; 

industry
 trends and customer preferences and the demand for our products, services, technologies and systems; and 

the
 nature and intensity of our competition, and our ability to successfully compete in our markets. 

These
statements are necessarily subjective, are based upon our current plans, intentions, objectives, goals, strategies, beliefs, projections
and expectations, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results,
performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements described
in or implied by such statements. Actual results may differ materially from expected results described in our forward-looking statements,
including with respect to correct measurement and identification of factors affecting our business or the extent of their likely impact,
the accuracy and completeness of the publicly available information with respect to the factors upon which our business strategy is based,
or the success of our business. Furthermore, industry forecasts are likely to be inaccurate, especially over long periods of time. 

Forward-looking
statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether,
or the times by which, our performance or results may be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the
time those statements are made and management s belief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking
statements. Important factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results to differ materially
from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed under the caption Risk
Factors in our prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

of the Safe-Pro
USA Members units, representing of Safe-Pro USA s issued and outstanding member interests (the Safe Pro USA Member
Interests ). On June 7, 2022, the Company closed the Exchange Agreement and acquired of the Safe-Pro USA Member Interests.
The Safe-Pro USA Member Interests were exchanged for shares of the Company s Series A preferred stock. Safe-Pro USA is
a premier manufacturer and seller of high-performance ballistics solutions, including ballistic protective equipment, consisting of explosive
ordinance disposal and unexploded ordinance disposal products, ballistic vests, body armor, helmets, ballistic blankets, and more. 

On
August 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the Acquisition Agreement with (i) Airborne Response
Corp. Airborne Response ), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on September 7, 2016 under the
name of Airborne Response, LLC. and (ii) the shareholders of Airborne Response. On March 21, 2022, Airborne Response, LLC changed its
name to Airborne Response Corp. and converted from a limited liability company to a corporation. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement,
the Company acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of Airborne Response in exchange for Series B preferred stock
of the Company. Airborne Response is a provider of mission critical aerial intelligence solutions using uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS),
more commonly known as drones, to its customers. Airborne Response delivers a full range of drone-based, aerial services
including site surveys/mapping, infrastructure inspection, data capture, analytics and processing powered by machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) to provide customers with comprehensive data-driven insights and reporting. 

On
March 9, 2023 (the Closing Date ), the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with (i) Safe Pro AI LLC Safe Pro AI ), organized under the state of New York on February 22, 2021, under the name of Demining
Development LLC. and (ii) the members of Safe Pro AI. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired of the member
interests of Safe Pro AI in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock, which shares vested on September
9, 2023 and remaining shares were to vest as follows: shares twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date, on the eighteen-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, and on the twenty-four-month anniversary of the Closing Date. On December 31, 2023, the Company s
board of directors approved the vesting of the remaining shares. Safe Pro AI owns certain software technologies that enable the
rapid, automated processing of aerial and ground-based imagery making it an ideal solution for several applications including demining
and in law enforcement and security. These shares were valued at , or per share, on the measurement date based on recent
sales of units of common stock and warrants. Other than owning certain technologies, Safe Pro AI had no operations and no employees and
was not considered a business. Pursuant to ASU 2017-01 and ASC 805, the Company analyzed the Exchange Agreement and the business of Safe
Pro AI to determine if the Company acquired a business or acquired assets. Based on this analysis, it was determined that the Company
acquired assets. No goodwill was recorded since the Exchange Agreement was accounted for as an asset purchase. In accordance with ASC
805, the fair value of the assets acquired is based on either the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets
acquired, whichever is more clearly evident, and thus, more reliably measurable. The Company used the fair value of the common
shares issued of as the fair value of the assets acquired since this value was more clearly evident, and thus, more reliably
measurable than the fair value of the software technologies acquired.

The
Company s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial
markets, including conditions that are outside of its control, including the impact of health and safety concerns, such as the war in
Ukraine and the Middle East. The most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit
markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for the
Company s products and services and its ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak
or declining economy could strain the Company s domestic and international customers, possibly resulting in delays in customer
payments. Any of the foregoing could harm the Company s business and it cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic
climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact the Company s business.

Business
Overview 

We
were incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 15, 2021. Safe Pro Group Inc. is the parent company of Airborne Response Corp.
and Safe-Pro USA, LLC, which were both incorporated in Florida, in 2016 and 2008, respectively. On March 9, 2023, Safe Pro Group Inc.
acquired Safe Pro AI LLC (formerly known as Demining Development LLC), a privately held
developer of Artificial Intelligence AI and Machine Learning ML software technology for processing of
drone-based imagery and data. We are a company focused on innovative security and protection solutions, specifically, advanced artificial
intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) software technology for the creation of robust datasets sourced from the analysis of aerial imagery,
bullet and blast resistant personal protection equipment and providing mission-critical aerial managed services. 

Through
a layered approach to the development and integration of advanced technologies in artificial intelligence, drone-based remote sensing
technologies and services, and personal protective gear, Safe Pro Group seeks to provide government, NGOs and enterprises with innovative
solutions designed to respond to evolving threats. 

Recent
Developments 

On
August 29, 2024, we consummated our initial public offering IPO ), pursuant to which we sold 1,020,000 shares of
common stock at an offering price of 5.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the
 Underwriting Agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc., as representative of the underwriters listed on Schedule I
thereto (the Underwriters ). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we issued a common stock purchase warrant to the
Underwriter for the purchase of 51,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 6.25, subject to adjustments (the
 Warrant ). The Warrant will be exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the period
commencing on March 1, 2025 and ending on August 28, 2029 and may be exercised on a cashless basis under certain circumstances. In
connection with the IPO, (i) our outstanding Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock were converted into an aggregate
of 2,810,000 shares of common stock; (ii) 480,000 shares of common stock was issued to certain executives pursuant to their
respective employment agreements, and (iii) 252,666 shares of common stock was issued upon conversion of convertible notes and
accrued interest. 

In
connection with the IPO, we sold 1,020,000 shares of common for gross proceeds of 5,100,000 and received net proceeds of 4,179,500,
after fees and expenses of 920,500. The Underwriters did not exercise the option to purchase up to an additional 153,000 shares of common
stock from the Company. 

Principle
of Consolidation 

Our
consolidated financial statements included in this report include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries: Airborne Response Corp.,
Safe-Pro USA LLC, and Safe Pro AI LLC from their respective dates of acquisition. 

Segment
Information 

The
Company uses the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the
internal organization and reporting used by the Company s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing
performance as the source for determining the Company s reportable segments. The Company s chief operating decision maker
is the chief executive officer of the Company, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance for the entire Company. During the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company operated in three reportable
business segments which consisted of (1) the business of Safe-Pro USA, (2) the business of Airborne Response, and (3) the business of
Safe Pro AI. The Company s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products. They are managed separately
based on the fundamental differences in their operations and locations.

Significant
Components of Our Results of Operations 

Revenues.
 Our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of our products, which consist primarily of personal protective gear PPE and ballistic protective equipment including Explosive Ordnance Disposal EOD and blast and fragmentation resistant vests
and body armor, as well as aerial managed services (drones) for the inspection of customer s critical infrastructure including
radio towers and power grids. At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in the contract with customers and identify
a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, we consider all products and services promised in the contract
regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing of satisfaction of the performance
obligation is not subject to significant judgment. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange
for transferring goods and services. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue
recognition criteria have been met. 

Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit. Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including changes
in our supply chain and the evolving product mix. The margin profile of our current products and future products will vary depending
on operating performance, features, materials, manufacturer and supply chain. Gross margin will vary as a function of changes in pricing
due to competitive pressure, our third-party manufacturing, labor costs for services and depreciation for our drone related fixed assets,
our production costs, which includes depreciation related costs for manufacturing equipment, costs of shipping and logistics, provision
for excess and obsolete inventory and other factors. We expect our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period depending on the
interplay of these various factors. 

Operating
Expenses. We classify our operating expenses as salary, wages and payroll taxes, research and development, professional fees,
selling, general, administrative, non-production and services related depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we separate depreciation
and amortization expense into its own category. 

Salary,
Wages and Payroll Taxes. Salaries are representative of officer and stock-based compensation and administrative personnel costs.
Wages consist primarily of manufacturing wages. The salary and wages associated payroll tax is reflected here as well. 

Research
and Development expenses consist of costs associated with personnel and contractor fees associated with the design and development
of our products, product certification, travel, recruiting and information technology. We generally recognize research and development
expenses as incurred. Development costs incurred prior to establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. We expect
our research and development costs to continue to increase as we develop new products and modify existing products to meet the changes
within our markets. 

Professional
Fees primarily represent certain costs for legal, audit, accounting, public company expense, investor relations, consulting fees
and share-based compensation. 

Selling,
General and Administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our training programs, trade shows, marketing programs,
promotional materials, demonstration equipment, commissions payable, national and local regulatory approvals of our products, travel,
entertainment, recruiting, operating supplies such as, computer equipment, drones, EOD testing supplies; and facilities and other supporting
overhead costs. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, as we ramp
up our sales and marketing expansion efforts to correspond with our increased production efforts, relating to our personal protective
gear, the availability of additional AI-powered image processing solutions and new drone-based services such as Drone as a Responder
(DaaR). 

33 

Depreciation
and Amortization expense consists of depreciation related to computer and related office equipment, as well as amortization related
to finite-lived intangibles. 

Interest
Expense is comprised of interest expense associated with our secured notes payable and convertible notes. The amortization of
debt discounts is also recorded as part of interest expense. 

Provision
for Income Taxes. Current and deferred income tax expense or benefit in any given period will depend upon a number of events
and circumstances, one of which is the income tax net income or loss from operations for the period which is usually different from the
U.S. GAAP net income or loss, for the period due to differences in tax laws and timing differences. Management assesses our deferred
tax assets in each reporting period, and if it is determined that it is not more likely than not to be realized, we will record a change
in our valuation allowance in that period.

Net
Revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues generated were 330,756 and 163,547, an increase of 167,209
or 102.2 . Comparable sales for Safe-Pro USA were 98,637 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 58,590 for the
same period in 2023, an increase of 40,047 or 68.4 . Comparable sales for Airborne Response were 227,745 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 as compared to 104,957 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 122,788 or 117.0 . Safe Pro AI had sales of 4,375,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which related to the launch of Spotlight AI on July 1, 2024. The increase in revenue was
attributable to an increase in recurring revenue from existing customers. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues generated were 1,281,399 and 640,062, an increase of 641,337 or 100.2 .
Comparable sales for Safe-Pro USA were 751,031 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 519,728 for the same period
in 2023, an increase of 231,303 or 44.5 . Comparable sales for Airborne Response were 525,992 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to 120,334 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 405,658 or 337.1 . Safe Pro AI had sales of 4,375, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, which related to the launch of Spotlight AI on July 1, 2024. The increase in revenue was attributable
to two additional customers, which represented 44.7 of the total sales and an increase in recurring revenue from existing customers
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Cost
of Revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues increased to 196,523 compared to 101,011,
an increase of 95,422, or 94.4 . Gross profit margins were 40.6 and 38.2 , respectively. The increase in gross profit margins for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 were due to increased sales of manufactured product which has a higher gross profit. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue increased to 839,098, as compared to 406,896, for the same period in the prior year,
an increase of 432,202 or 106.2 . Gross profit margins were 34.5 and 36.4 , respectively. The decrease in margin was attributable to
an increase in sales for two new customers that represented 44.7 of our total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which
was for non-manufactured product which has a lower gross profit margin. We expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase during
fiscal 2024 and beyond, as we expand our operations and begin generating additional revenues under our current business. However, we
are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases. 

35 

Operating
Expenses. Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3,676,307 and 740,664, an increase

an increase of 4,068,221 or 191.5 . Factors resulting in the increase are described more fully below. 

Salaries,
wages and payroll taxes. Total salaries, wages and payroll taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2,745,525
and 339,210, an increase of 2,406,315 or 709.4 . Total salaries, wages and payroll taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 were 3,571,310 and 911,537, an increase of 2,659,773 or 291.8 . The increases were primarily attributable stock-based compensation
of 2,200,000 and 464,199, pursuant to new employment agreements, in preparation for the Company s initial public offering. 

Research
and Development expenses were 0 and 91,537, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of
 91,537 or 100.0 . Research and Development expenses were 85,937 and 243,972, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, a decrease of 158,035 or -64.8 . The decrease is primarily attributable to the second quarter capitalization of development
costs of 172,596 for the Company s advanced artificial intelligence AI -powered object detection and data analysis
and reporting tools for hyper-scalable, cloud-based processing of drone imagery, which was put in service on July 1, 2024. 

Professional
fees were 430,698 and 175,246 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 255,452 or
145.8 . The increase for the quarter is due to stock based compensation of 200,000. Professional fees were 1,508,908 and 541,736 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 967,172 or 178.5 . The increase for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was attributable to; an increase in non-cash expenses for share-based compensation of 603,000, audit
related expenses of 251,675, investor relations of 53,372, public company expense of 27,125, director fees 12,789, other professional
fees of 29,889, associated with the preparation of the Company s initial public offering, offset by a decrease of legal fees of
 10,678. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were 418,366 and 89,142 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
an increase of 329,224 or 369.3 . Selling, general and administrative expenses were 853,077 and 290,014 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 563,063 or 194.2 . The increases for the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, are indicative of the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of 563,063 which is primarily attributable
to increases in: advertising of 107,592, related to social media branding, employee benefits of 51,366, related to amended employment
agreements, franchise taxes of 24,654, other selling, general and administrative costs of 22,866, variable costs which fluctuates to
an increase in sales of 212,628 and D O insurance of 17,708, offset by product costs incurred in the prior year of 30,531. 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses were 81,718 and 45,529 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase
of 36,189, or 79.5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization costs were 172,834 and 136,586
respectively, an increase of 36,248, or 26.5 . The increase relates to the implementation of Spotlight AI on July 1, 2024, which resulted
in its amortization with a useful life of five years of 36,000 at September 30, 2024. 

We
expect our expenses in each of these areas to continue to increase during fiscal 2024 and beyond as we expand our operations and begin
generating additional revenues for our current business. However, we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases. 

Total
Other (Income) Expense. Our total other expenses were 143,382 compared to 1,566, during the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 respectively, an increase of 141,816 or 9055.9 . Our total other expenses were 294,474 compared to 3,580, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 290,894 or 8125.5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the increase is primarily attributed to an increase in interest expense related to convertible debt of 300,470, offset by an increase
in interest income of 9,576 and an increase in interest expense of, from the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 151,898, which
was further offset by an increase in interest income of 10,082. 

Net
Loss . We recorded a net loss of 3,685,456 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 679,784, for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a net loss of 6,044,239 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to a net loss of 1,894,259, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is a result of the factors as described above.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting policies are
more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes. In preparing our consolidated financial
statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in
the Notes. We consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements
because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting
estimates are described in the following paragraphs. Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. 

Besides
estimates that meet the critical accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience
and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances
change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem critical. 

Accounts
receivable and other receivables 

The
Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses on January 1, 2023. The Company recognizes an allowance
for losses on accounts receivable and other receivables in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries under the
current expected credit loss method. The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging,
and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts or other accounts considered at risk
or uncollectible. The bad debt expense associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and other receivables
is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

38 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle
by applying the following steps: 

Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

 Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

 Step
3: Determine the transaction price. 

 Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

 Step
5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
Company offers a warranty on its manufactured products. The Company considered the need to make an accrual for warranty expenses that
may be incurred. Historically, the Company has incurred no warranty expense and accordingly, the Company believes that no warranty expense
accrual is deemed necessary. 

Safe-Pro
USA 

The
Company recognizes revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Performance obligations are determined through a review
of customer contracts and may differ between customers depending upon contract terms. 

For
a Bangladesh customer for which Safe-Pro USA historically derived a significant portion of its revenue the Company has identified two
performance obligations: 

1) 
 The
 sale and delivery of safety equipment, ballistic and bomb vests, helmets, and other equipment. 

2) 
 Training
 and final inspections related to the sale of the equipment. 

The
Company estimated the allocation of the transaction price to each of the above performance obligations since it does not have evidence
of standalone selling process, which is summarized as follows: 

Performance Obligation 1 - Historically, the Company has received 80 of the contract price upon shipment and presentation of required
documents. 

Performance Obligation 2 - The remaining 20 of the contract price shall be authorized and received after 1) post-shipment inspection
is performed, functionality testing is performed, and approval of the testing is granted. The 20 is triggered after testing and training.
Local training with the contracted items consists of 1) use and care training, 2) engineering, repair, maintenance, and 3) inventory
management. Historically, the remaining 20 has not been collected. Although the Company believes this 20 will ultimately be collected,
due to the historical non-payment of this 20 , the Company will not record such revenue until such time as collection is probable and
all training and inspections are completed. 

In
connection with the revenue associated with the significant customer discussed above, the Company shall pay a commission of approximately
10 of amounts collected to local agents that assist with the facilitation of training, shipment, and documentation. 

Revenue
from other Safe-Pro USA customers is generally recognized at the time of shipment, which is the time that the Company satisfies its performance
obligations. 

Revenue
from product sales is recognized when the related goods are shipped whereas revenue from training and inspection activities is recognized
when the services are completed and payment is probable. Discounts in multiple elements sold as a single arrangement are allocated proportionately
to the individual elements based on the fair value charged when the element is sold separately. 

39 

Airborne
Response 

Airborne
Response recognizes revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Performance obligations are determined through a review
of customer contracts and may differ between customers depending upon contract terms. Revenues from services are recognized at a point
in time when Airborne Response completes services pursuant to its agreements with clients and collectability is probable. 

Safe
Pro AI 

Safe
Pro AI will sell subscriptions to its customers for the use of its software under a software as a service subscription model SaaS ),
which will allow for the rapid, automated processing of aerial and ground-based imagery uploaded by customers, making it an ideal solution
for a number of applications including demining, in law enforcement and security. The Company s SaaS offerings shall be sold under
a prepaid or postpaid, usage-based pricing system pursuant to a tiers model, allowing customers to choose the subscription level to be
charged based upon their intended usage. The subscription tiers will utilize declining prices as the volume grows. Under this model,
customers are charged an upfront fee based upon the number of gigapixels of aerial images uploaded into the system for processing. For
customer convenience, Safe Pro AI will initially charge data processing fees on a per hectare basis (1 hectare = 1,000 square meters).
Under prepaid pay-as-you-go plans, revenues related to contracts that do not include a specified contract period are recognized upon
usage by the customer and satisfaction of the Company s performance obligation. These usage-based revenues are constrained to the
amount the Company expects to be entitled to and receive in exchange for providing access to its platform. If professional services are
deemed to be distinct, revenue is recognized as services are performed. The Company does not view the signing of the contract or the
provision of initial setup services as discrete earnings events that are distinct. 

Goodwill
and intangible assets 

The
Company s business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount
of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that the Company may incur in future periods. 

Intangible
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization for finite-lived assets, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life, less any impairment charges. 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill is
not subject to amortization but is subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill
by reporting unit at least annually, or when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. To test
goodwill impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value
of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Company would not be required to quantitatively determine the fair value of goodwill
unless it determines, based on the qualitative assessment there are indicators of impairment. Under the quantitative test of goodwill,
the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the
fair value, then the goodwill is impaired by the excess amount. The Company performs its annual testing for goodwill during the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit. 

Intangibles
assets, net consists of contractual employment agreements, customer relationships and acquired capitalized internal-use software. All
intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of an intangible asset
is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. The Company periodically evaluates
both finite and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment upon occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate
the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company
recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value. 

Stock-based
compensation 

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which
requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services
in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and
non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize
forfeitures as they occur as permitted under the FASB s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-09 Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment. 

40 

Business
acquisitions 

The
Company accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting where the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are recognized based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature
and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation
methodology, projected revenue, expenses, and cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, and estimates of terminal
values. Business acquisitions are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. 

Asset
Acquisitions 

The
Company evaluates acquisitions pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, to determine whether the acquisition should
be classified as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Acquisitions for which substantially all of the fair value of
the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets are accounted for
as an asset acquisition. For asset acquisitions, the Company allocates the purchase price of these acquired assets on a relative fair
value basis and capitalizes direct acquisition related costs as part of the purchase price. Acquisition costs that do not meet the criteria
to be capitalized are expensed as incurred and presented in general and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of operations,
if any. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by
this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the appropriate time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer,
who serves as our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures due to management identifying material weaknesses in internal controls over financials
reporting related to (i) inventory control management; and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. Therefore,
our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible or economically feasible. However, to the extent
possible, we are implementing procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
will be performed by separate individuals. 

Notwithstanding
this conclusion, we believe that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report fairly present our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby in all material respects. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as set forth in the following sentence, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we engaged a third-party inventory control management consultant to assist us
in implementing an inventory control management system. Additionally, we have designed and implemented new internal policies and procedures
to address a prior material weakness related to revenue recognition cut-offs.

PART
II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of
business. The Company is not currently involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation, and to the best of our knowledge, no governmental
authority is contemplating any proceeding to which the Company is a party or to which any of the Company s properties is subject,
which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating
results. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors.

addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section entitled
 Risk Factors in our Prospectus, which is incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in the Prospectus are not
the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes to our
risk factors from those set forth in our Prospectus.
