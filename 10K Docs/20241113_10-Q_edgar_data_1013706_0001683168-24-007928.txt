 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

By Order dated May 8, 2020
(the Class Certification Order ), the Court denied class certification in the Pressley case, denied class certification with
respect to the breach of contract and alleged unpaid usage claims, granted class certification as to the New York Labor Law causes of
action asserted by Vretman, Palomares and Trotter, and declined to rule on Wilhelmina s motions for summary judgment, denying them
without prejudice to be re-filed at a later date. Currently the parties are engaging in merits discovery. 

The Company believes the claims
asserted in the Shanklin Litigation and Pressley Litigation are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend the actions.
Nonetheless, an adverse outcome in either case is at least reasonably possible. However, the Company is presently unable to reasonably
estimate the amount or range of possible loss in either case. Therefore, no amount has been accrued as of September 30, 2024 related to
these matters. 

In addition to the legal proceedings
disclosed herein, the Company is also engaged in various legal proceedings that are routine in nature and incidental to its business.
None of these routine proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, are believed likely, in the Company's opinion, to have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or its results of operations.

shares of its outstanding common stock. During 2013, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the Company s share repurchase
authority to enable it to repurchase up to an aggregate of 
 shares of common stock. In 2016, the Board of Directors increased by an additional 
 shares the number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be repurchased under its stock repurchase program to
an aggregate of 
 shares, and on November 8, 2024, an additional 750,000 shares of common stock were newly authorized for repurchase resulting in
a total of 2,250,000 total shares authorized under the plan with approximately 935,000 shares of common stock remaining for repurchase.
The shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices the Company
deems appropriate. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or
suspended at any time at the Company s discretion. 

From 2012 through September
30, 2024, the Company had repurchased shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share, for a total
of approximately million in repurchases under the stock repurchase program. During the first nine months of 2024, shares were
repurchased under the stock repurchase program.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following is a discussion
of the interim unaudited consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the Company and its subsidiaries for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company,
the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report, and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements relating to the Company and its subsidiaries

the interest rate environment, governmental regulation and supervision, seasonality, changes in industry practices, one-time events and
other factors described herein and in other filings made by the Company with the SEC. Should any one or more of these

OVERVIEW 

The primary business of
Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in New York City. The Company s
predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the oldest, best known and
largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding, Wilhelmina has grown to include operations located
in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model
and talent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and other
talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media and catalog
companies. 

Trends and Opportunities 

The Company expects that the
combination of Wilhelmina s main operating base in New York City, the industry s capital, with the depth and breadth of its
talent pool and client roster and its diversification across various talent management segments, together with its geographical reach,
should make Wilhelmina s operations more resilient to industry changes and economic swings than those of many of the smaller firms
operating in the industry. 

With total annual advertising
expenditures on major media (newspapers, magazines, television, cinema, outdoor and Internet) estimated to have exceeded 280 billion
in recent years, North America is the world s largest advertising market. For the fashion talent management industry,
including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet, magazines, and outdoor are of particular relevance. 

In recent periods, traditional
retail clients in the fashion and beauty industry have had increased competition from digital, social, and new media, reducing their budgets
for advertising and model talent. Wilhelmina reviews the mix of talent and resources available to best operate in this changing environment. 

11 

Although Wilhelmina has a
large and diverse client base, it is not immune to global economic conditions. The Company closely monitors economic conditions, client
spending, and other industry factors and continually evaluates opportunities to increase its market share and further expand its geographic
reach. There can be no assurance as to the effects on Wilhelmina of current or future economic circumstances, client spending
patterns, client creditworthiness and other developments and whether, or to what extent, Wilhelmina s efforts to respond to them
will be effective. 

Strategy 

Management s long-term
strategy is to increase value to shareholders through the following initiatives: 

increase Wilhelmina s brand awareness among advertisers and potential talent; 

expand
the women s high end fashion board; 

expand
the Aperture division s representation in commercials, film, and television; 

expand
celebrity and social media influencer representation; 

expand
the Wilhelmina network through strategic geographic market development; and 

promote
model search contests and events and partner on media projects (television, film, books, etc.). 

The Company makes use of digital
technology to effectively connect with clients and talent, utilizing video conferencing and other digital tools to best position our team
to identify opportunities to grow the careers of the talent we represent and expand our business. The Company has made significant investments
in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, to support our clients and talent. 

Key Financial Indicators 

In addition to net income,
the key financial indicators that the Company reviews to monitor its business are revenues, operating expenses, and cash flows. 

The Company analyzes revenue
by reviewing the mix of revenues generated by the different boards, each a specific division of the fashion model management
operations which specializes by the type of model it represents, by geographic locations and from significant clients. Within its
fashion model management business, Wilhelmina s primary source of service revenue is from model fees and service charges paid by
the client for bookings directly negotiated by the Company. The Company also receives commissions paid on bookings by third-party agencies.
See Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition. 

Wilhelmina provides professional
services. Therefore, salary and service costs represent the largest part of the Company s operating expenses. Salary and service
costs are comprised of payroll and related costs and travel, meals and entertainment T E to deliver the Company s
services and to enable new business development activities.

Service Revenues 

The Company s service
revenues fluctuate in response to its clients willingness to spend on advertising and the Company s ability to have the desired
talent available. The 2.2 increase for the three months and the 0.9 decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same periods in 2023, were mainly driven by higher commissions from core model bookings in the second and third quarters of 2024.
However, this growth did not fully offset the lower commissions experienced in the first quarter of 2024. 

License Fees and Other Income 

License fees and other income
include franchise revenues from independently owned model agencies that use the Wilhelmina trademark and various services provided by
the Company. License fees were unchanged for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Salaries and Service Costs 

Salaries and service costs
consist of payroll related costs and T E required to deliver the Company s services to its clients and talents. The 9.0 
and 4.7 increases in salaries and service costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to personnel hires and payroll changes to better align Wilhelmina staffing
with the needs of each office and geographical region. 

Office and General Expenses 

Office and general expenses
consist of office and equipment rents, legal expenses, advertising and promotion, insurance expenses, administration and technology cost. The
increase in office and general expenses of 7.0 for the three ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three ended September 30,
2023, were primarily due to increased legal expense, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, insurance, and computer and office
expenses. The decrease in office and general expenses of 12.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to decreased legal, bad debt, computer and office expenses, partially offset by increased
bank fees and model apartment expenses. 

Amortization and Depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation
expense is incurred with respect to certain assets, including computer hardware, software, office equipment, furniture, and finance leases. Amortization
and depreciation expense decreased by 18.2 and 17.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreased depreciation of capitalized furniture and leasehold assets at the Company s
new New York City office. Fixed asset purchases (mostly related to technology and computer equipment) totaled approximately 10 thousand
and 26 thousand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32 thousand and 141 thousand for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Corporate Overhead 

Corporate overhead
expenses include director and executive officer compensation, legal, audit and professional fees, corporate office rent and travel.
Corporate overhead decreased by 31.0 and 11.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased audit costs incurred with the change of auditors in Q2 of the
previous year, directors fees with fewer Board of Director members, and lower corporate travel costs in the current year, partially
offset by increased legal costs. 

14 

Operating Income and Loss and Operating Margin 

Operating income was 0.3
million and 0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.5 million and 0.8 million in the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, operating margin decreased to 7.3 and 6.0 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 10.4 and 6.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were primarily
the result of the higher increase in operating expenses than net revenue in the third quarter of 2024. 

Foreign Currency Exchange 

The Company realized 4 thousand
and 18 thousand loss from foreign currency exchange during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 18 thousand gain
and 61 thousand loss from foreign currency exchange during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Foreign currency gain
and loss is due to fluctuations in currencies from Great Britain, Europe, and Latin America. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense is primarily
attributable to interest on finance leases. Interest expense was 3 and 8 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 0 thousand and 1 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest Income 

Interest expense is primarily
attributable to interest from short term investments. Interest income was 90 and 263 thousand for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 0 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income before Income Taxes 

Income before income taxes
decreased to 0.4 million and increased to 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of
 0.5 million and 0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower pre-tax income in the third quarter of
2024 and nine months of 2023 was primarily due to lower operating income. 

Income Taxes 

Generally, the Company s combined effective tax rate is high
relative to reported net income (loss) as a result of the expiration of stock options, amortization expense, and income being attributable
to certain states in which it operates. The Company operates in three states, which have relatively high corporate tax rates: California,
New York, and Florida. In addition, foreign taxes in the United Kingdom related to our London office are not deductible for U.S. federal
tax purposes. The Company had income tax expense of 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively compared to 0.1 million and 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Net Income and Loss 

The Company had a net income
of 310 thousand and 648 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 359 thousand
and 504 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in operating income. The increase in
net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to interest
income from short-term investments. 

15 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s cash balance
increased to 6.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million at December 31, 2023. The cash balances increased as a result of 0.3
million net cash provided by operating activities, 0.1 million net cash used in investing activities, 0 million cash used in financing
activities, and 138 thousand positive effect of exchange rate on cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net cash provided by operating
activities of 0.3 million was primarily the result of net income and increases in deferred income taxes, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, and a decrease in operating right of use assets, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in
operating lease liabilities. The 0.1 million cash used in investing activities was attributable to purchases of short term investments
and property and equipment, including furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, software and computer equipment, offset by maturities
of short term investments. 

The Company s primary
liquidity needs are for working capital associated with performing services under its client contracts. Generally, the Company incurs
significant operating expenses with payment terms shorter than its average collections on billings. Based on budgeted and year-to-date
cash flow information, management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its projected operational expenses and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and beyond. 

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial
Measures 

The Company reports its financial
results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's
financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. The Company considers Gross Billings, EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important measures of performance because they are key operating metrics of the Company's
business. These metrics are used by management in its planning and budgeting processes, to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating
results and provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results, and to
provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company s financial and operating results against other
companies within the Company's industry. 

Gross Billings represents
the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for services performed. The Company calculates Gross Billings
as total revenue plus model costs, which includes amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly
to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those paid for photography. The Company calculates
EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates Adjusted
EBITDA as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring items that
the Company may include from time to time. The Company calculates Pre-Corporate EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate
overhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws compliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public
company costs. 

Non-GAAP financial measures
should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact
the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual
and future financial condition and performance. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ
significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented
herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Wilhelmina and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

17 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company has adopted the
requirements of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ASC
606 ). ASC 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in
an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. 

Our revenues are derived primarily
from fashion model bookings and representation of social media influencers and actors for commercials, film, and television. Our
performance obligations are primarily satisfied at a point in time when the talent has completed the contractual requirements. 

A contract s transaction
price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
The performance obligations for most of the Company s core modeling bookings are satisfied on the day of the event, and the day
rate total fee is agreed in advance when the customer books the model for a particular date. For contracts with multiple performance
obligations, we allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone
selling price. 

We report service revenues
on a net basis, which represents gross amounts billed net of amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted
directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those paid for photography. The Company
typically enters into contractual agreements with models under which the Company is obligated to pay talent upon collection of fees from
the customer. 

Although service revenues
are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers, inclusive of model costs.
As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue. 

Amounts billed that have not
yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue within accrued expenses and the related talent costs
are recorded as contract liability. 

Share Based Compensation 

Share-based compensation expense
is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized
on a straight line basis as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The determination of
the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the estimated volatility over the expected term of the
awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. 

Income Taxes 

We are subject to income taxes in the United States, the United Kingdom,
and numerous US state and local jurisdictions. 

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax
credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which they can be used. Unused tax loss carry-forwards are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is established if
it is doubtful we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry-forwards. 

18 

In determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, we take
into account whether additional taxes, interest, or penalties may be due. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our
income taxes, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax
outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such
determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts 

Accounts receivable are accounted
for at net realizable value, do not bear interest and are short-term in nature. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts receivable. Based on management s assessment, the
Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance. Balances that remain
outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to
accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral. 

Although service revenues
are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers inclusive
of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue. 

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing 

The Company performs impairment
testing at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss
is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The Company sometimes utilizes an
independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-03, effective January 1,
2020, only a one-step quantitative impairment test is performed, whereby a goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of
a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill. 

Whenever events or circumstances
change, entities have the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment. If impairment is
deemed more likely than not, management would perform the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required.
In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying
amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit s
fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the identification of
macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, Company specific events and share price trends,
an assessment of whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such
impact. 

The Company evaluates indefinite
lived trademark and trade name intangible assets for impairment using the relief from royalty method. This valuation approach requires
that the Company make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value, including projections of future revenues, royalty rates, tax rates,
discount rates, and other relevant variables. The projections in this model are updated annually and will change over time based on historical
performance and changing business conditions. If the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized
for the excess amount.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information it is required to disclose in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
