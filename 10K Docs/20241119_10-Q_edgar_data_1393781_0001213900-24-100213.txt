of this information is to provide management s recap of the past year, and to give an understanding of management s current
outlook for the near future. This section is meant to be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on

Overview 

QIND is a Nevada Corporation
that is majority-owned by ILUS. ILUS functions as QIND s parent company, and as such it concentrates on providing strategic

Factors Affecting Our Performance 

The primary factors affecting our results of operations
include but are not limited to: 

General Macro Economic Conditions 

Our business is impacted by
the global economic environment, employment levels, consumer confidence, government, and municipal spending. Global instability in securities
markets and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are among other factors that can impact our financial performance. In particular, changes
in the U.S. economic climate can impact the demand of our product range. The Industrial and Manufacturing sectors are impacted by
the overall economic environment as addressed in the risk factors. Tenders can be withdrawn and lead times for the manufacturing can be
affected which can result in cancellation of orders if not delivered on time. 

Recent Developments

into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement with the shareholders of Al Shola Al Modea Gas Distribution LLC ASG or Al
Shola Gas to acquire a 51 interest in ASG. The Closing of the transaction took place when both parties signed the definitive

Directors of the Company approved the cancellation of the agreement with Quality International Co Ltd FZC signed on January 18, 2023,
and amended on July 27, 2023. The company is in the process of unwinding the remaining part of the transaction consisting of 2M buy-back
commitment, with management aiming to recover the investment or parts of it. However, if recovery proves unattainable, the investment
may need to be written off.

including regulatory approvals. The Parties have also agreed to several post-closing covenants, including actions related to shareholder

Planned Developments 

In the final quarter of 2024, the Company intends to allocate resources
to its operating subsidiary, Al Shola Gas, with the objectives of enhancing efficiency, driving increased sales, expanding into new territories,
and positively influencing our financial performance, supported by our parent company, Fusion Fuel Green PLC, which is listed on the NASDAQ
under the symbol HTOO. Furthermore, the Company plans to invest in new vehicles, specifically bobtail trucks, for Al Shola
Gas to augment their Bulk LPG supply capabilities, thereby enhancing our revenue stream. We anticipate that both our revenue and operating
expenses will experience an increase as we implement our expansion plan related to Al Shola Gas. This increase will primarily be attributed
to administrative and operating costs associated with our business activities. 

Results of Operation for the Three and Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenues 

We earned 2,662,050 
 5,979,256 in revenue for the Three and Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0 in revenue for the Three and Nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue is a result of revenue from our acquisition of Al Shola Gas consolidated from the second
quarter of 2024. In the third quarter, Al shola Gas, grew its revenue with 17 compared with the same quarter last year. We expect the
revenue to grow in the last three months of the year compared with Q3. The last quarter of the year has historically been the strongest
for our operating business Al Shola Gas. 

3 

Gross Profit 

We earned 1,080,762 
 3,649,260 in Gross Profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0 in Gross Profit for the Three and
Nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit increased to 40.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with Gross
Profit of 38.9 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross profit is attributable to a strategic shift in
our operating business, Al Shola Gas, to Bulk LPG with higher margins. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses increased
to 1,187,583 for the Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 825,608 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating
expenses increased to 2,098,762 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 900,0675 for the Nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Our operating expenses for
the Three and Nine month ended September 30, 2024, were mainly as a result of administrative and operating costs associated with
the business activities of our subsidiary Al Shola Gas, and increased costs associated with the intended uplist to NASDAQ including but
not limited to a reaudit of 2022 and 2023 fiscal years with our new independent auditor enabling a registration statement once uplisted. Our
operating expenses for the Three and Nine month ended September 30, 2023, were mainly the result of issuance of shares to our management 

We anticipate that our operating
expenses will increase as we undertake our control plan associated with operating business Al Shola Gas. The increase will be attributable
to administrative and operating costs associated with our business activities and the professional fees associated with our reporting
obligations. 

Non-Operating Expenses 

We had other non-operating
expenses of 140,833 for the Three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 129,336 for the Three months ended September 30, 2023.
Non-operating expenses increased to 306,684 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 174,574 for the Nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Our non-operating expenses
for the Three and Nine month ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were higher due to stock issued discount
and interest of debts. 

Our Interest on Convertible
notes for the three and Nine month ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 increased. The management plan to pay
off some or all of the notes with an intended uplist to NASDAQ. 

Non-Operating Income 

We had other non-operating
 income of 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared 0 for the same period ended 2023. We had other non-operating
 income of 427,554 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared 0 for the same period ended 2023. Our other income for
the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a result of reversal of interest payments on the loan agreements with Mahavir and Artelliq
in the first quarter which was unwound with cancellation of the agreement with Quality International. 

4 

Net Income/Net Loss 

We
incurred Net loss of 283,750 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 1,939,269 for
the Three months ended September 30, 2023. We earned Net Income of 271,383 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
a net loss of 3,606,026 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were mainly associated with
one off costs with the intended uplist to NASDAQ. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30,
2024, we had total current assets of 6,346,815 and total current liabilities of 10,123,134. We had a working capital deficit of
 3,776,319 as of September 30, 2024. This compares with a working capital deficit of 6,089,634 as of December 31, 2023. 

Operating activities provided
 (1,675,954) in cash for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with (2,792,079) used in cash for the Nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Investing activities used
 881,025 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 470,000 used in cash for the Nine months ended September
30, 2023. We expect our investing cash flow will grow upon uplist to a national exchange as result of investing in long-term assets for
the company s growth. 

Financing activities used
 1,014,064 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2,324,222 in cash provided for the same period ended
2023. Our financing cash flow for Q3 2024, were mainly the result of changes in retained earnings and minority interest, proceeds from
conversion notes and additional paid in capital from share issuances. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business. 

Management evaluated all relevant
conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated financial statements
are issued and determined. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to continue
to generate sufficient revenues and raise capital within one year from the date of filing. 

Over the next twelve months,
management plans to use borrowings and security sales to mitigate the effects of cash flow deficits; however, no assurance can be given
that debt or equity financing, if and when required, will be available. 

5 

Impact of Acquisitions 

Historically a significant
component of our growth has been through the acquisition of businesses in our targeted sectors. We typically incur upfront costs as we
incorporate and integrate acquired businesses into our operating philosophy and operational excellence. This includes consolidation of
supplies and raw materials, optimized logistics and production processes, and other restructuring and improvements initiatives. The benefits
of these integration efforts and upcoming planned acquisitions may not positively impact our financial results in the short term but has
historically been the case in the medium to long term. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In December 2001, the SEC
requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The
SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition
and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates
about the effect of inherently uncertain matters. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in the Notes of our unaudited financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Goodwill 

The Company continues to review
its goodwill for possible impairment or loss of value at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances
indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value. On September 30, 2024, we performed a goodwill
impairment evaluation. We performed a qualitative assessment of factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the goodwill
impairment test. Based on the results of the work performed, the Company has concluded that no impairment loss was warranted on September
30, 2024. Factors including non-renewal of a major contract or other substantial changes in business conditions could have a material
adverse effect on the valuation of goodwill in future periods and the resulting charge could be material to the future periods 
results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no significant off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In January 2017, the FASB
issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating
step two from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment
loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
ASU 2017-04 also clarifies that an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of
the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, for both interim and annual reporting periods. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of the
adoption of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements. 

6 

The Company has implemented
all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued
that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

A smaller reporting company
is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls

as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,

financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly

known as the Default Amount and all other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable, all
without demand, presentment or notice, all of which hereby are expressly waived, together with all costs, including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be entitled to exercise all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. 

3 

If the Borrower fails to pay the
Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the Holder shall have the right
at any time, to convert the balance owed pursuant to the note including the Default Amount into shares of common stock of the Company
as set forth herein. 

ARTICLE IV. CONVERSION RIGHTS 

4.1
 Conversion Right . At any time following an Event of Default, the Holder shall have the right, to convert all or any part of the
outstanding and unpaid amount of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the
Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed
or reclassified at the conversion price determined as provided herein (a Conversion ); provided , however , that
in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of
which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common
Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the
determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99 
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall
be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and
Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The beneficial ownership limitations on conversion
as set forth in the section may NOT be waived by the Holder . The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion
of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect
on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B(the Notice of Conversion ), delivered
to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 4.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or
e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York
time on such conversion date (the Conversion Date ); however, if the Notice of Conversion is sent after 6:00pm, New York,
New York time the Conversion Date shall be the next business day. The term Conversion Amount means, with respect to any
conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder s
option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,
 plus (3) at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses
(1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 4.4 hereof. 

4 

The Holder shall be entitled to deduct
 1,500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover Holder s deposit fees associated with each Notice of
Conversion. Any additional expenses incurred by Holder with respect to the Borrower s transfer agent, for the issuance of the Common
Stock into which this Note is convertible into, shall immediately and automatically be added to the balance of the Note at such time as
the expenses are incurred by Holder. 

4.2 Conversion
Price . The conversion price (the Conversion Price shall mean 65 multiplied by the lowest Trading Price for the Common
Stock during the ten (10) Trading Days prior to the Conversion Date (representing a discount rate of 35 (subject to equitable adjustments
by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization,
reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). Trading Price means, for any security as of any date,
the closing bid price on the OTCQB, OTCQX, Pink Sheets electronic quotation system or applicable trading market (the OTC as reported by a reliable reporting service Reporting Service designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTC
is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or
trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such security is available in any of the foregoing
manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the pink sheets .
If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the
fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which
the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. Trading Day shall
mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTC, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities
market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. 

4.3 Authorized
Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period that the Note is outstanding, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized
and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon
the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and
reserved four times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of
the Note in effect from time to time initially 12,614,836 shares) (the Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased
from time to time in accordance with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares
will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change
to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then
current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i)
acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged
with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Note. 

If, at any time the Borrower does not
maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under this Note. 

5 

4.4 Method of Conversion . 

(a) Mechanics
of Conversion . As set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, at any time following an Event of Default, the balance due pursuant to this Note
may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower
a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00
p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 4.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower (upon
payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder). 

(b) Surrender
of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal
amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and
the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require
physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. 

(c) Delivery
of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable
means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 4.4, the Borrower
shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt (the Deadline (and, solely in the case of conversion
of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.
Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to
reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect to the portion of this
Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets,
as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s
obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of
any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment
against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower
to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder
of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower
to the Holder in connection with such conversion. 

(d) Delivery
of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion,
provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer FAST program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to
cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of
Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian DWAC system. 

6 

(e) Failure to Deliver
Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual
damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not
delivered by the Deadline due to action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Holder 2,000 per day in
cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the Fail to Deliver Fee );
provided; however that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent;
and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such
Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or,
at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has
accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the
terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt
to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 4.4(e) are justified. 

4.5
 Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless:
(i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall
have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel
in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption
from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) Rule 144 ); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 4.5
and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). 

Any restrictive legend on certificates
representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder
a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel
from Holder s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect
that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted
by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note,
such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be
sold pursuant to an exemption from registration. In the event that the Company does not reasonably accept the opinion of counsel provided
by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration (such as Rule 144), it will be considered
an Event of Default pursuant to this Note. 

4.6 Effect of Certain Events . 

(a) Effect of Merger,
Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50 of the
voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into
any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall be deemed to be an Event of Default (as
defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a
condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article III). Person shall mean any
individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization. 

7 

(b) Adjustment
Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the
Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result
of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes
of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter
have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu
of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would
have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without
regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the
rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment
of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as
may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect
any transaction described in this Section 4.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days prior written notice
(but in any event at least five (5) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or
if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization
or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor
or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note. The above provisions shall similarly
apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(c) Adjustment
Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders
of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the
Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a
 Distribution ), then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record
for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the
Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common
Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution. 

ARTICLE V. MISCELLANEOUS 

5.1 Failure
or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further

also speculative. The Note offered hereby are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk and Lender should only purchase
these securities if Lender can afford to lose their entire investment.

and Standing . The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

b. Authorization .
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action,
and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
as to enforcement of remedies to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and compliance with the provisions hereof by the Company
does not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default (or an
event with which the giving of notice or passage of time, or both could result in a default) under, or result in the creation or imposition
of any lien pursuant to the terms of, the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company. 

c. Securities .

3.
 Representations, Warranties of Investor and Restrictions on Transfer 

a. Representations
and Warranties of Investor . The Investor represents and warrants to the Company with respect to the purchase of Securities under
this Agreement as follows: 

i. This
Agreement constitutes the Investor s valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms. 

ii. The
Investor is acquiring the Common Stock for its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for the resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ). The
Investor understands that the shares of Common Stock have not been registered under the Act or any applicable state securities laws by
reason of a specific exemption therefrom that depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent as expressed
herein. 

iii. The
Investor has discussed the Company and its plans, operations and financial condition with its officers and has received all such information
as the Investor deems necessary and appropriate to enable the Investor to evaluate the financial risk inherent in making an investment
in the Common Stock. The Investor has received satisfactory and complete information concerning the business and financial condition
of the Company in response to the Investor s inquiries. 

iv. The
Investor realizes that the acquisition of the Common Stock will be a highly speculative investment. The Investor is able, without impairing
the Investor s financial condition, to hold the Common Stock for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of the Investor s
investment. The Investor recognizes that the Company has only recently been organized and that it has a limited financial and operating
history and the investment in the Company involves substantial risks. The Investor understands all of the risks related to the acquisition
of the Common Stock. By virtue of the Investor s experience in evaluating and investing in private placement transactions of securities
in companies similar to the Company, the Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Investor s investment in the Company
and has the capacity to protect the Investor s own interests. 

v. The
Investor understands that the Common Stock must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Act or unless an exemption
from registration is otherwise available. Moreover, the Investor understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the
Common Stock. The Investor is aware of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act that permits limited resale of securities purchased in a private
placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Investor understands that the Common Stock will be imprinted with a
legend which prohibits the transfer of the Common Stock unless they are registered or such registration is not required in the opinion
of counsel for the Company. 

2 

b. Legends .
In addition to any legend imposed by state securities laws, each certificate representing the Common Stock shall be endorsed with the
following legends: 

THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ACT ), OR UNDER THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED
OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM.
INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME.
THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT
ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

The
Company need not register a transfer of Common Stock unless the conditions specified in the foregoing legends are satisfied. The Company
may also instruct its transfer agent not to register the transfer of any of the Common Stock unless the conditions specified in the foregoing
legends are satisfied. 

c. Removal
of Legends and Transfer Restrictions . The legend relating to the Act endorsed on a stock certificate pursuant to paragraph 4(b) of
this Agreement and the stop transfer instructions with respect to such Common Stock shall be removed and the Company shall issue a stock
certificate without such legend to the holder of such Common Stock if such Shares are registered under the Act and a prospectus meeting
the requirements of Section 10 of the Act is available, or if such holder provides to the Company an opinion of counsel for such holder
of the Shares or Note reasonably satisfactory to the Company or a no-action letter or interpretive opinion of the staff of the Commission
to the effect that a public sale, transfer or assignment of such Shares or Note may be made without registration and without compliance
with any restriction such as Rule 144. Any legend imposed by state securities laws will be removed if the state agency imposing such
legend has consented to its removal. 

4.
 Miscellaneous . 

a. Governing
Law . This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflict of law
provisions thereof.

The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the sale of the Common
Stock. 

c. Successors
and Assigns . Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon,
the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto. 

3 

d. Entire
Agreement . This Agreement embodies the entire understanding and agreement between each Investor and the Company and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. 

e. Notices,
etc. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be effective upon receipt and shall be in writing
and may be delivered in person, by telecopy, electronic mail, overnight delivery service or U.S. mail, addressed (a) if to an Investor,
at his or her address set forth opposite such Investors name on the last page of this Agreement, or at such other address as such Investor
shall have furnished the Company in writing, or (b) if to the Company, at the address of its principal office, or at such other address
as the Company shall have furnished to the Investor in writing. 

f. Titles
and Subtitles . The titles of the paragraphs and subparagraphs of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not
to be considered in construing this Agreement. 

g. Counterparts .
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. 

h. Amendments
and Waivers . Any term of this Agreement may be amended and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and the holders
of the Common Stock. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section shall be binding upon each holder of any securities
purchased under this Agreement at the time outstanding (including securities into which such securities are convertible), each future
holder of all such securities, and the Company.

WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the day and year first written above.
