of the voting rights of a subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in the combination and consolidation. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity. The Company reports consolidated net income (loss) inclusive of both the Company s and the noncontrolling interests share, as well as the amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to each of the Company and the noncontrolling interests. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former controlled subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value. If a subsidiary is consolidated upon the business acquisition of controlling interests by the Company, any previous noncontrolled equity investment in the subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income (loss) based on such fair value. The Company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in 50 or less owned companies that it does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the business venture. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has between and of the voting rights of a business venture but may exist when the Company s ownership percentage is less than 20 . In certain circumstances, the Company may have an economic interest in excess of 50 but may not control and consolidate the business venture. Conversely, the Company may have an economic interest less than 50 but may control and consolidate the business venture. The Company reports its investments in and advances to these business ventures in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments, at equity, and advances to 50 or less owned companies. The Company reports its share of earnings from investments in 50 or less owned companies in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss) as equity in earnings of 50 or less owned companies, net of tax. Certain reclassifications were made to previously reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to make them consistent with the current period presentation.

years. Equipment maintenance and repair costs and the costs of routine overhauls, drydockings and inspections performed on vessels and equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred. Expenditures that extend the useful life or improve the marketing and commercial characteristics of equipment as well as major renewals and improvements to other properties are capitalized. Certain interest costs incurred during the construction of equipment are capitalized as part of the assets carrying values and are amortized over such assets estimated useful lives. There was capitalized interest recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 t record impairment charges on any owned or leased-in vessels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges of million for leased-in anchor handling towing supply vessel AHTS to adjust for indicative future cash flows. There were no impairments of other owned or leased-in vessels. Impairment charges are included in gains (losses) on asset dispositions and impairments in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Estimated fair values for the Company owned vessels were established by independent appraisers based on researched market information, replacement cost information and other data. For vessel classes and individual vessels with indicators of impairment as of September 30, 2024, the Company estimated that their future undiscounted cash flows exceeded their current carrying values. However, the Company s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective as utilization and rates per day worked are uncertain, especially in light of the continued volatility in commodity prices as well as the timing and cost of reactivating cold-stacked vessels. If market conditions decline, changes in the Company s expectations on future cash flows may result in recognizing additional impairment charges related to its long-lived assets in future periods. For any vessel or vessel class that has indicators of impairment and is deemed not recoverable through future operations, the Company determines the fair value of the vessel or vessel class. If the fair value determination is less than the carrying value of the vessel or vessel class, an impairment is recognized to reduce

per share Warrants issued and outstanding during the relevant periods. The Warrants are included in the basic earnings/loss per share of Common Stock because the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are issuable for de minimis cash consideration and therefore not anti-dilutive. Diluted earnings/loss per share of Common Stock is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Warrants issued and outstanding plus the effect of other potentially dilutive securities through the application of the treasury stock method and the if-converted method that assumes all shares of Common Stock have been issued and outstanding during the relevant periods pursuant to the conversion of the New Convertible Notes unless anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , diluted loss per share of Common Stock excluded shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the New Convertible Notes as the effect of their inclusion in the computation would be anti-dilutive. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 diluted loss per share of Common Stock excluded and shares of restricted stock, respectively, and and shares of Common Stock, respectively, issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, as the effect of their inclusion in the computation would be anti-dilutive.

Economic Hedges. The Company may enter and settle forward currency exchange, option and future contracts with respect to various foreign currencies. These contracts enable the Company to buy currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates, which could offset possible consequences of changes in currency exchange rates with respect to the Company s business conducted outside of the U.S. The Company generally does not enter into contracts with forward settlement dates beyond 12 to 18 months. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a forward exchange contract related to the purchase of hybrid battery power systems, the purchase price for which is denominated in Norwegian Kroner. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized losses of million on this contract which were recognized in earnings. Cash Flow Hedges. The Company may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges. By entering into interest rate swap agreements, the Company can convert the variable interest component of certain of their outstanding borrowings to a fixed interest rate. The Company recognized losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Long-term debt, including current portion 

The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivables approximates fair value. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated based upon quoted market prices or by using discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated current rates for similar types of arrangements. Considerable judgment was required in developing certain of the estimates of fair value, and, accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. Property and equipment . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Company recognized impairment charges totaling million for one leased-in AHTS to adjust for indicative cash flows and the cost to return the vessel to its owner.

Of the unfunded capital commitments, million is payable during the remainder of 2024 and million is payable during 2025. The Company has indefinitely deferred an additional million of orders with respect to fast support vessel. In December 2015, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office issued a tax-deficiency notice to Seabulk Offshore do Brasil Ltda, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SEACOR Marine Seabulk Offshore do Brasil ), with respect to certain profit participation contributions (also known as PIS and social security financing contributions (also known as COFINS requirements alleged to be due from Seabulk Offshore do Brasil Deficiency Notice in respect of the period of January 2011 until December 2012. In January 2016, the Company administratively appealed the Deficiency Notice on the basis that, among other arguments, (i) such contributions were not applicable in the circumstances of a / cost allocation structure, and (ii) the tax

million based on a historical potential levy of R million (USD million and USD million, respectively, based on the exchange rate as of September 30, 2024). In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various other litigation matters including, among others, claims by third parties for alleged property damages and personal injuries. Management has used estimates in determining the Company s potential exposure to these matters and has recorded reserves in its financial statements related thereto where appropriate. It is possible that a change in the Company s estimates of that exposure could occur, but the Company does not expect that such changes in estimated costs would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension funds in the United Kingdom: the U.K Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund MNOPF and the U.K. Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund MNRPF ). The Company s participation in the MNOPF began with the acquisition of the Stirling group of companies (the Stirling Group in 2001 and relates to certain officers employed between 1978 and 2002 by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors. The Company s participation in the MNRPF also began with the acquisition of the Stirling Group in 2001 and relates to ratings employed by the Stirling Group and/or its predecessors through today. Both of these plans are in deficit positions and, depending upon the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience funding deficits that will require the Company to recognize payroll related operating expenses in the periods invoices are received. On October 19, 2021, the Company was informed by the MNRPF that two issues had been identified during a review of the MNRPF by the applicable trustee that would potentially give rise to material additional liabilities for the MNRPF.

 Overview 
 The Company provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide. As of September 30, 2024, the Company operated a diverse fleet of 55 support vessels, of which 54 were owned or leased-in and one was managed on behalf of an unaffiliated third party. The primary users of the Company s services are major integrated national and international oil companies, independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, oil field service and construction companies, as well as offshore wind farm operators and offshore wind farm installation and maintenance companies. 
 The Company operates and manages a diverse fleet of offshore support vessels that (i) deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations, including offshore wind farms, (ii) assist offshore operations for production and storage facilities, (iii) provide construction, well work-over, offshore wind farm installation and decommissioning support, (iv) carry and launch equipment used underwater in drilling and well installation, maintenance, inspection and repair and (v) handle anchors and mooring equipment for offshore rigs and platforms. Additionally, the Company s vessels provide emergency response services and accommodations for technicians and specialists. 
 The Company operates its fleet in four principal geographic regions: the United States U.S. ), primarily in the Gulf of Mexico; Africa and Europe; the Middle East and Asia; and Latin America, primarily in Mexico and Guyana. The Company s vessels are highly mobile and regularly and routinely move between countries within a geographic region. In addition, the Company s vessels are redeployed among geographic regions, subject to flag restrictions, as changes in market conditions dictate. 
 22 

Significant items affecting our results of operations 
 The number and type of vessels operated, their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of the Company s operating results and cash flows. Unless a vessel is cold-stacked, there is little reduction in daily running costs for the vessels and, consequently, operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization. The Company manages its fleet utilizing a global network of shore side support, administrative and finance personnel. 
 Offshore oil and natural gas market conditions are highly volatile. Oil prices experienced unprecedented volatility during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effects on the global economy, with the price per barrel going negative for a short period of time. Oil prices steadily increased since the lows hit at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and hit a multi-year high of 122 per barrel during 2022 primarily as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the related economic sanctions and economic uncertainty but subsequently decreased to pre-conflict levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, WTI oil prices reached a high of 87 per barrel and a low of 66 per barrel, ending the period at 68 per barrel. 
 While the Company has experienced difficult market conditions over the past few years due to low and volatile oil and natural gas prices and the focus of oil and natural gas producing companies on cost and capital spending budget reductions, the increases since the lows experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in oil and natural gas prices has led to an increase in utilization, day rates and customer inquiries about potential new charters. 
 The Company closely monitors the availability of vessels in the offshore support vessel market as the utilization and day rates of the Company s fleet is dependent on the supply and demand dynamics for its vessels. For example, low oil and natural gas prices and a corresponding decline in offshore exploration may reduce demand for the Company s vessels and in the past such declines have forced many operators in the industry to restructure, liquidate assets or consolidate with other operators. Additionally, the delivery of newly built offshore support vessels to the industry-wide fleet has in the past contributed to an oversupply of vessels in the market, thereby further decreasing the demand for the Company s existing offshore support vessel fleet. A combination of low customer exploration and drilling activity levels, and excess supply of offshore support vessels whether from laid up fleets or newly built vessels could, in isolation or together, have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Alternatively, increasing activity levels and a stable supply of offshore support vessels could support higher utilization and day rates and improved financial performance of the Company s business. 
 Certain macro drivers somewhat independent of oil and natural gas prices may support the Company s business, including: (i) underspending by oil and natural gas producers over the last five to ten years leading to pent up demand for maintenance and growth capital expenditures; (ii) improved extraction technologies; and (iii) the need for offshore wind farm support as the industry grows. While the Company expects that alternative forms of energy will continue to develop and add to the world s energy mix, especially as governments, supranational groups, institutional investors, and various other parties focus on climate change causes and concerns, the Company believes that for the foreseeable future demand for gasoline and oil will be sustained, as will demand for electricity from natural gas. Some alternative forms of energy such as offshore wind farms support some of the Company s operations and the Company expects such support to increase as development of these forms of renewable energy expands. 
 The Company adheres to a strategy of cold-stacking vessels (removing from active service) during periods of weak utilization in order to reduce the daily running costs of operating the fleet, primarily personnel, repairs and maintenance costs, as well as to defer some drydocking costs into future periods. The Company considers various factors in determining which vessels to cold-stack, including upcoming dates for regulatory vessel inspections and related docking requirements. The Company may maintain class certification on certain 
 23 

cold-stacked vessels, thereby incurring some drydocking costs while cold-stacked. Cold-stacked vessels are returned to active service when market conditions improve, or management anticipates improvement, typically leading to increased costs for drydocking, personnel, repair and maintenance in the periods immediately preceding the vessels return to active service. Depending on market conditions, vessels with similar characteristics and capabilities may be rotated between active service and cold-stack. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its cold-stacked vessels to determine if any should be designated as retired and removed from service based on the vessel s physical condition, the expected costs to reactivate and restore class certification, if any, and its viability to operate within current and projected market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, two of the Company s 54 owned and leased-in vessels were cold-stacked worldwide. 
 Recent Developments 
 At the Market Program 
 On November 1, 2023, SEACOR Marine entered into an at-the-market offering program ATM Program with B. Riley Securities, Inc., pursuant to which SEACOR Marine may sell up to 25.0 million of Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining capacity under the ATM Program was approximately 24.9 million.

Current Year Quarter compared with Prior Year Quarter 
 Operating Revenues . Charter revenues were 9.6 million lower in the Current Year Quarter compared with the Prior Year Quarter. Charter revenues were 7.7 million lower due to reduced utilization and day rates of the vessels included in the results of this region in both comparative periods (as applicable to each region, the Regional Core Fleet ), 1.6 million lower due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions and 0.3 million lower due to net asset dispositions. Other marine services were 4.3 million lower primarily due to business interruption insurance revenues recorded in the Prior Year Quarter and lower mobilization revenues and management fees in the Current Year Quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had two of ten owned vessels (one liftboat and one FSV) cold-stacked in this region compared with two of 13 vessels (one liftboat and one FSV) as of September 30, 2023.

Short and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements 
 The Company believes that a combination of cash balances on hand, cash generated from operating activities and access to the credit and capital markets, including the 24.9 million in remaining capacity under the ATM Program, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including to support its capital expenditures program, working capital needs, debt service requirements and covenant compliance over the short to long term. The Company continually evaluates possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. The Company s sources of liquidity may be impacted by the general condition of the markets in which it operates and the broader economy as a whole, which may limit its access to or the availability of the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms. Management continuously monitors the Company s liquidity and compliance with covenants in its credit facilities.

 With the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only a level of reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Current Year Quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
