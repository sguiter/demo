 The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to state and local taxes, a discrete shortfall tax expense related to stock compensation and a discrete tax expense associated with the recording of accrued penalties and interest on historical uncertain tax positions.

 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects to recognize of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations during October 2024.

 RSU 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted RSUs under its equity incentive plan. Each RSU provides the recipient with the right to receive a share of common stock subject to graded vesting terms based on service, which for the awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, generally requires approximately of service for members of the Company s board of directors and approximately of service for employees. The value of the RSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on the preceding trading day, in accordance with the Company s policy for valuing such awards. Compensation expense related to the RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period. 
 PSU 
 2024 Grants 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted PSUs (at target) under its equity incentive plan. The PSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provide the recipients with the right to receive shares of common stock dependent on of a Company-specific financial performance target and on the relative increase in the total shareholder return TSR goal the Performance measures ). The Performance measures are measured independently of each other, but achievement of both metrics is measured on the same performance period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 Performance period ). Depending on the Company s performance relative to the Performance measures, each PSU award recipient is eligible to receive a percentage of the target number of shares granted to the recipient, ranging from to . The PSUs, to the extent earned, will vest on the date the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors Compensation Committee certifies the achievement of the Performance measures for the Performance period, which will occur subsequent to the end of the Performance period and after the Company files its annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2026. 
 Achievement of the Company-specific financial performance target is measured based on the actual cumulative results across the Performance period. The TSR goal is based on the Company s actual TSR performance against companies in the S P 1500 Specialty Chemicals Index over the Performance period. The TSR goal, which determines how much of the of the PSUs granted during 2024 may be earned, is considered a market condition as opposed to a vesting condition. Because a market condition is not considered a vesting condition, it is reflected in the grant date fair value of the award and the associated compensation cost based on the fair value of the award is recognized over the Performance period, regardless of whether the Company actually achieves the market condition or the level of achievement, as long as service is provided by the recipient.

 Key Performance Indicators 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and that we use to evaluate our operating performance, for business planning purposes and to measure our performance relative to that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are presented as key performance indicators as we believe these financial measures will enhance a prospective investor s understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. EBITDA consists of net income attributable to continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items included in net income and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and (iii) depreciation, amortization and interest of our 50 share of the Zeolyst Joint Venture. Adjusted Net Income consists of net income adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense and (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items included in net income that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. 
 You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Net Income in isolation or as alternatives to the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income financial measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, you should be aware that we are likely to incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to GAAP net income are included in the results of operations discussion that follows for each of the respective periods. 
 Key Factors and Trends Affecting Operating Results and Financial Condition 
 Sales 
 Sales in our Ecoservices and Advanced Materials Catalysts segments are made on both a purchase order basis and pursuant to long-term contracts. Within the Zeolyst Joint Venture, included in our Advanced Materials Catalysts segment, we may also experience demand fluctuations based upon the timing of some of our customer s fixed bed catalyst replacements or the timing of sales of catalysts used in the production of sustainable fuels. 
 Our Ecoservices and Advanced Materials Catalysts segments continued to benefit from positive demand trends for our products and services in the majority of end uses we serve. For Ecoservices, strong domestic and export demand for refined products continued to support high refinery utilization rates, while more stringent gasoline standards and growing demand for premium gasoline to power higher-compression and turbo-charged engines continued to drive demand for alkylate and for our regeneration services. In addition, demand for virgin sulfuric acid across a wide range of industrial applications remained favorable. For our Advanced Materials Catalysts segment, global polyethylene demand remained positive, supporting our sales of polyethylene catalysts and catalysts supports. Within the Zeolyst Joint Venture, hydrocracking catalyst sales continued to reflect demand fluctuations driven by customer order timing associated by the timing of fixed bed catalyst replacement cycles and sales of niche-custom catalysts, which tend to be event driven, continued to reflect variability in customer order patterns. 
 With a current imbalance between the production capacity for renewable diesel and current demand, we continue to expect lower demand in the near to mid-term for catalyst sales into the production of renewable diesel. In addition, given various macro-economic conditions which have adversely impacted sales of heavy-duty diesel vehicles, we reduced our expectations for sales of emission control catalysts. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold consists of variable product costs, fixed manufacturing expenses, depreciation expense and freight expenses. Variable product costs include all raw materials, energy and packaging costs that are directly related to the manufacturing process. Fixed manufacturing expenses include all plant employment costs, manufacturing overhead and periodic maintenance costs. 
 The primary raw materials for our Ecoservices segment include spent sulfuric acid, sulfur, acids, bases (including sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda and certain metals. Spent sulfuric acid for our Ecoservices segment is supplied by customers for a nominal charge as part of their contracts. The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of products in our Advanced Materials Catalysts segment include sodium silicate and cesium hydroxide.

Table of Contents 

 Most of our Ecoservices contracts feature take-or-pay volume protection and/or quarterly price adjustments for commodity inputs, labor, the Chemical Engineering Index (U.S. chemical plant construction cost index) and natural gas. Over 80 of our Ecoservices segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 were under contracts featuring quarterly price adjustments. The price adjustments generally reflect actual costs for producing acid and tend to protect us from volatility in labor, fixed costs and raw material pricing. The take-or-pay volume protection allows us to cover fixed costs through intermittent, temporary production issues at customer refineries. 
 While natural gas is not a direct feedstock for any product, natural gas powered machinery and equipment are used to heat raw materials and create the chemical reactions necessary to produce end-products. We maintain multiple suppliers wherever possible and structure our customer contracts when possible to allow for the pass-through of raw material, labor and natural gas costs. 
 Joint Venture 
 We account for our investments in our equity joint ventures under the equity method. Our joint venture, the Zeolyst Joint Venture, manufactures high-performance, specialty, zeolite-based catalysts, used in emission control, refining and petrochemical industry applications and by the broader chemicals industry. Demand for the Zeolyst Joint Venture products fluctuates based upon the timing of our customer s fixed bed catalyst replacements. We share proportionally in the management of our joint venture with the other parties to such joint venture. 
 Seasonality 
 Our regeneration services product group, which is a part of our Ecoservices segment, typically experiences seasonal fluctuations as a result of higher demand for gasoline products in the summer months and lower demand in the winter months. These demand fluctuations generally result in higher sales and working capital requirements in the second and third quarter. 
 Foreign Currency 
 As a global business, we are subject to the impact of gains and losses on currency translations, which occur when the financial statements of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We operate in various geographies with approximately 5 of our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 6 for the year ended December 31, 2023 were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our condensed consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, sales or earnings generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales and earnings when translated to U.S. dollars. The foreign currency to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposure is the British pound. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Highlights 
 The following is a summary of our financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales 
 Sales increased 5.9 million to 179.2 million. The increase in sales was primarily due to the result of higher average selling prices for regeneration services and higher sales volume of virgin sulfuric acid. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gro ss profit increased 1.5 million to 54.7 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher average selling pricing and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income decreased by 0.4 million to 31.6 million. The decrease in operating income was due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit and lower other operating expenses, net.

 Average selling prices were higher primarily due to favorable contractual pricing in regeneration services. The increase in sales volume was primarily related to the increased demand for virgin sulfuric acid. 
 Advanced Materials Catalysts: Sales in Advanced Materials Catalysts for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 25.3 million, a decrease of 0.4 million, or 1.6 , compared to sales of 25.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million was primarily due to the timing of niche custom catalysts sales, partially offset by higher advanced silicas used for the production of polyethylene.

 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 54.7 million, an increase of 1.5 million, or 2.8 , compared to 53.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher average selling prices of 3.0 million, higher sales volume and mix of 3.3 million, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs of 4.8 million. 
 Average selling prices were higher primarily due to the favorable contractual pricing in regeneration services. The increase in sales volume was primarily related to higher demand for virgin sulfuric acid and higher advanced silicas used for the production of polyethylene. Higher manufacturing costs were driven by general inflation, higher planned maintenance costs and costs associated with our manufacturing plant reliability improvement program in Ecoservices. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 20.0 million, an increase of 3.1 million, compared to 16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in other compensation-related expenses of 3.7 million, offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in stock compensation due to fewer overall awards granted and outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 Other operating ex pense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million, a decrease of 1.2 million, compared to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other operating expense, net was primarily due to a decrease in net loss from asset disposals of 0.8 million compared to the prior year. 
 Equity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies 
 Equity in net income of affiliated comp anies for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a net loss of 0.9 million, compared to net income of 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to 5.6 million of lower earnings from the Zeolyst Joint Venture during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings from the Zeolyst Joint Venture was due to lower sales volume of catalysts used in the production of sustainable fuels and emission control applications, partially offset by higher sales of hydrocracking catalysts and custom catalysts. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net for the three month s ended September 30, 2024 was 11.3 million, a decrease of 0.5 million, as compared to 11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the period over period decrease in the interest rate spread on the term loan during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million, an increase of 0.2 million, as compared to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other expense, net primarily relates to lower other income of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange of 0.2 million mainly related to the remeasurement effects of monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currency. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.5 million, compared to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.0 , compared to 32.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s quarter over quarter effective income tax rate has fluctuated primarily due to a reduced discrete tax impact relative to pre-tax book income. The discrete tax items relate to a stock compensation shortfall, tax expense associated with the recording of accrued penalties and interest on historical uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit related to state tax refunds associated with prior tax years recorded during the current quarter. 
 The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to state and local taxes, a discrete shortfall tax expense related to stock compensation and a discrete tax expense associated with the recording of accrued penalties and interest associated with historical uncertain tax positions.

 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects to recognize 8,023 of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations during October 2024. 
 Net Income 
 For the foregoing reasons, net income was 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Summarized Adjusted EBITDA information is shown below in the following table: 
 Three months ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in millions, except percentages) Adjusted EBITDA: (1) 
 Ecoservices 55.1 54.7 0.4 0.7 Advanced Materials Catalysts (2) 
 10.9 16.4 (5.5) (33.5) Unallocated corporate expenses (6.2) (3.2) (3.0) (93.8) Total 59.8 67.9 (8.1) (11.9) 
 
 (1) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items as noted in the reconciliation below. Our management evaluates the performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow for periods presented and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as defined by other companies. 
 (2) The Adjusted EBITDA for the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment includes our 50 portion of the Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture. The Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture included in the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment was 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes 0.9 million of equity in net loss, excluding 0.6 million of amortization of investment in affiliate step-up plus 3.6 million of joint venture depreciation, amortization and interest. 
 The Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture included in the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment was 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which includes 4.7 million of equity in net income, excluding 1.6 million of amortization of investment in affiliate step-up plus 3.3 million of joint venture depreciation, amortization and interest. 
 Ecoservices: Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 55.1 million, an increase of 0.4 million, or 0.7 , compared to 54.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was a result of favorable contractual pricing for regeneration services and higher sales volume of virgin sulfuric acid, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs associated with inflation, increased planned maintenance costs and costs associated with the manufacturing plant reliability improvement program. 
 Advanced Materials Catalysts: Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.9 million, a decrease of 5.5 million, or 33.5 , compared to 16.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of lower sales volume within the Zeolyst Joint Venture associated with catalysts used in the production of sustainable fuels and emission control applications, partially offset by higher sales of hydrocracking catalysts and custom catalysts. In Advanced Silicas, favorable mix and increased sales of advanced silicas used for the production of polyethylene helped drive higher Adjusted EBITDA.

 0.5 0.3 Other (h) 
 (0.8) (0.4) Adjusted EBITDA 59.8 67.9 
 
 (a) We use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure to evaluate our financial results. Because our Advanced Materials Catalysts segment includes our 50 interest in the Zeolyst Joint Venture, we include an adjustment for our 50 proportionate share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense of the Zeolyst Joint Venture. 
 (b) Represents the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the equity affiliate investment in the Zeolyst Joint Venture as a result of the combination of the businesses of PQ Holdings Inc. and Eco Services Operations LLC in May 2016. We determined the fair value of the equity affiliate investment and the fair value step-up was then attributed to the underlying assets of the Zeolyst Joint Venture. Amortization is primarily related to the fair value adjustments associated with intangible assets, including customer relationships and technical know-how. 
 (c) When asset disposals occur, we remove the impact of net gain/loss of the disposed asset because such impact primarily reflects the non-cash write-off of long-lived assets no longer in use. 
 (d) Reflects the exclusion of the foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statements of income related to the remeasurement effects of monetary assets and liabilities, including non-permanent intercompany debt, denominated in foreign currency. 
 (e) Represents non-cash adjustments to the Company s LIFO reserves for certain inventories in the U.S. that are valued using the LIFO method, effectively reflecting the results as if these inventories were valued using the FIFO method, which we believe provides a means of comparison to other companies that may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories. 
 (f) Relates to certain transaction costs, including debt financing, due diligence and other costs related to transactions that are completed, pending or abandoned, that we believe are not representative of our ongoing business operations. 
 (g) Includes the impact of restructuring, integration and business optimization expenses, which are incremental costs that are not representative of our ongoing business operations. 
 (h) Other consists of adjustments for items that are not core to our ongoing business operations. These adjustments include environmental remediation and other legal costs, expenses for capital and franchise taxes, and defined benefit pension and postretirement plan (benefits) costs, for which our obligations are under plans that are frozen. Also included in this amount are adjustments to eliminate the benefit realized in cost of goods sold of the allocation of a portion of the contract manufacturing payments under the five-year agreement with the buyer of the Performance Chemicals business to the financing obligation under the failed sale-leaseback. Included in this line-item are rounding discrepancies that may arise from rounding from dollars (in thousands) to dollars (in millions).

 (1) We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted for non-operating income or expense and the impact of certain non-cash or other items that are included in net income that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is presented as a key performance indicator as we believe it will enhance a prospective investor s understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable with net income or Adjusted Net Income as defined by other companies. 
 (2) Refer to the Adjusted EBITDA notes above for more information with respect to each adjustment. 
 The adjustments to net income are shown net of applicable tax rates as determined by the calculation of our quarterly tax provision under interim financial reporting for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, except for equity-based compensation. The tax effect on equity-based compensation is derived by removing the tax effect of any equity-based compensation expense disallowed as a result of its inclusion within IRC Sec. 162(m) and adding the tax effect of equity-based stock compensation shortfall recorded as a discrete item.

The change in sales reflects higher sales volume of 36.4 million, offset by lower average selling prices of 30.4 million, inclusive of the negative impact associated with the pass-through of lower sulfur costs of approximately 7 million. 
 Sales volume was higher primarily due to increased virgin sulfuric acid and regeneration services sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which had the adverse impact of Winter Storm Elliott and extended maintenance turnaround activity at our facilities in 2023, as well as strong demand for regeneration services in the gulf coast in 2024. Average selling prices were lower primarily due to the pass-through of lower costs, including sulfur, natural gas, freight and other variable costs. 
 Advanced Materials Catalysts: Sales in Advanced Materials Catalysts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 73.1 million, a decrease of 1.8 million, or 2.4 , compared to sales of 74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of advanced silicas used for the production of polyethylene compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 147.6 million, a decrease of 3.0 million, or 2.0 , compared to 150.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by lower average selling prices of 23.0 million, exclusive of the approximately 7 million of pass-through of sulfur costs and unfavorable manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable variable costs and higher sales volume of 14.3 million. 
 Average selling prices were lower primarily due to the pass-through of lower costs, including sulfur, natural gas, electricity and other variable costs. The higher manufacturing costs were primarily driven by planned maintenance turnaround costs, general inflation and costs associated with the manufacturing plant reliability improvement program in Ecoservices. The increase in sales volume was primarily related to higher demand for both regeneration services and virgin sulfuric acid. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 64.3 million, an increase of 4.8 million, as compared to 59.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in other compensation-related expenses of 9.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation of 2.1 million, professional fees of 0.5 million and other expenses of 2.0 million. 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 Other operating expense, net for the nine months e nded September 30, 2024 was 9.9 million, a decrease of 7.3 million, compared to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Equity in Net Income of Affiliated Companies 
 Equity in net income of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 million, compared to 16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings from the Zeolyst Joint Venture was driven by lower sales of catalysts used in the production of sustainable fuels and emission control applications, partially offset by higher hydrocracking catalyst sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.6 million, an increase of 6.8 million, as compared to 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to the year over year increase in variable rates, which was partially offset by lower outstanding debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the benefits associated with our interest rate caps. 
 Debt Extinguishment Costs 
 Debt extinguishment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.6 million . On June 12, 2024, we amended our existing senior secured term loan facility to reduce the applicable interest rates and extend the maturity of the facility to June 2031. The Company evaluated the terms of the amendment in accordance with ASC 470-50 Debt - Modification and Extinguishment and determined that the amendment was primarily a modification of debt. As a result, we recorded 4.5 million of third-party financing fees as debt extinguishment costs in the condensed consolidated income statement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, previously unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount of 0.1 million associated with the existing senior secured term loan facility were written off as debt extinguishment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million, an increase of 0.5 million, as compared to 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other expense, net primarily consisted of an increase in foreign currency exchange of 0.6 million mainly related to the remeasurement effects of monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in foreign currency . 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.8 million, compared to 17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.9 , compared to 29.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was different from the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a reduced discrete tax impact relative to pre-tax book income. The discrete tax items relate to a stock compensation shortfall recognized discretely in the respective quarters, tax expense associated with the recording of accrued penalties and interest on historical uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit related to state tax refunds associated with prior tax years recorded during the current quarter. 
 The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to state and local taxes, a discrete shortfall tax expense related to stock compensation, a discrete tax expense associated with the recording of accrued penalties and interest on historical uncertain tax positions and recording a tax benefit related to tax refunds associated with prior years. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects to recognize 8,023 of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations during October 2024. 
 Net Income 
 For the foregoing reasons, n et income was 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items as noted in the reconciliation below. Our management evaluates the performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow for periods presented and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as defined by other companies. 
 (2) The Adjusted EBITDA for the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment includes our 50 portion of the Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture. The Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture included in the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment was 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which includes 2.5 million of equity in net income, excluding 3.2 million of amortization of investment in affiliate step-up plus 10.1 million of joint venture depreciation, amortization and interest. 
 The Adjusted EBITDA from the Zeolyst Joint Venture included in the Advanced Materials Catalysts segment was 31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which includes 16.4 million of equity in net income, excluding 4.8 million of amortization of investment in affiliate step-up plus 10.1 million of joint venture depreciation, amortization and interest. 
 
 Ecoservices: Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 146.3 million, a decrease of 5.3 million, or 3.5 , compared to 151.6 million for the nine mo nths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of higher turnaround and planned maintenance costs and unfavorable net pricing, reflecting the timing and contractual pass-through of certain costs including energy and other indexed costs. This was partially offset by higher sales volume of both virgin sulfuric acid and regeneration services. 
 
 Advanced Materials Catalysts: Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.8 million, a decrease of 17.9 million or 32.7 , compared to 54.7 million for the nine mo nths ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of lower sales volume within the Zeolyst Joint Venture associated with catalysts used in the production of sustainable fuels and emission control applications, partially offset by higher hydrocracking catalyst sales through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to prior year.

 (a) We use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure to evaluate our financial results. Because our Advanced Materials Catalysts segment includes our 50 interest in the Zeolyst Joint Venture, we include an adjustment for our 50 proportionate share of depreciation, amortization and interest expense of the Zeolyst Joint Venture. 
 (b) Represents the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the equity affiliate investment in the Zeolyst Joint Venture as a result of the combination of the businesses of PQ Holdings Inc. and Eco Services Operations LLC in May 2016. We determined the fair value of the equity affiliate investment and the fair value step-up was then attributed to the underlying assets of the Zeolyst Joint Venture. Amortization is primarily related to the fair value adjustments associated with intangible assets, including customer relationships and technical know-how. 
 (c) When asset disposals occur, we remove the impact of net gain/loss of the disposed asset because such impact primarily reflects the non-cash write-off of long-lived assets no longer in use. 
 (d) Reflects the exclusion of the foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statements of income related to the remeasurement effects of monetary assets and liabilities, including non-permanent intercompany debt, denominated in foreign currency. 
 (e) Represents non-cash adjustments to the Company s LIFO reserves for certain inventories in the U.S. that are valued using the LIFO method, effectively reflecting the results as if these inventories were valued using the FIFO method, which we believe provides a means of comparison to other companies that may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories.

 (g) Includes the impact of restructuring, integration and business optimization expenses, which are incremental costs that are not representative of our ongoing business operations. 
 (h) Other consists of adjustments for items that are not core to our ongoing business operations. These adjustments include environmental remediation and other legal costs, expenses for capital and franchise taxes, and defined benefit pension and postretirement plan (benefits) costs, for which our obligations are under plans that are frozen. Also included in this amount are adjustments to eliminate the benefit realized in cost of goods sold of the allocation of a portion of the contract manufacturing payments under the five-year agreement with the buyer of the Performance Chemicals business to the financing obligation under the failed sale-leaseback. Included in this line-item are rounding discrepancies that may arise from rounding from dollars (in thousands) to dollars (in millions).

 (1) We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted for non-operating income or expense and the impact of certain non-cash or other items that are included in net income that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is presented as a key performance indicator as we believe it will enhance a prospective investor s understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable with net income or Adjusted Net Income as defined by other companies. 
 (2) Refer to the Adjusted EBITDA notes above for more information with respect to each adjustment. 
 The adjustments to net income are shown net of applicable tax rates of 25.1 and 27.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, except for equity-based compensation. The tax effect on equity-based compensation is derived by removing the tax effect of any equity-based compensation expense disallowed as a result of its inclusion within IRC Sec. 162(m), and adding the tax effect of equity-based stock compensation shortfall recorded as a discrete item.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations, existing cash balances as well as funds available under our asset based lending revolving credit facility ABL Facility ). We expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources of funds. Our primary liquidity requirements include funding working capital requirements (primarily inventory and accounts receivable, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities), debt service requirements and capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures include both maintenance of business, which include spending on maintenance and health, safety and environmental initiatives as well as growth, which includes spending to drive organic sales growth and cost savings initiatives. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, combined with availability under our ABL Facility, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs for at least the next twelve months. We may also pursue strategic acquisition or divestiture opportunities, which may impact our future cash requirements. We may, from time to time, increase borrowings under our ABL Facility to meet our future cash needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 123.5 million and availability of 64.5 million under our ABL Facility, after giving effect to 3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, for a total available liquidity of 188.0 million. We did not have any revolving credit facility borrowings as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements. 
 Our ABL Facility has one financial covenant with two ratios to maintain. The first ratio compares the total ABL availability against a threshold: the greater of 10 of the line cap (which is defined as the lesser of our revolving loan commitments and the value of our assets) or 20.0 million. The greater of this threshold cannot be greater than the total availability of the ABL Facility. The second ratio compares the ABL Facility availability of the U.S. revolving credit facility against a 15.0 million threshold. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant under the ABL Facility. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility contain various restrictive covenants. Each limits the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness or liens, merge, consolidate or liquidate, dispose of certain property, make investments or declare or pay dividends, make optional payments, modify certain debt instruments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain sales and leasebacks and certain other non-financial restrictive covenants. During such time, the Company is required to maintain a fixed-charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the 2024 Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Included in our cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2024 was 18.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in foreign jurisdictions. Depending on foreign cash balances, we have certain flexibility to repatriate funds should the need arise. Should the need arise, we would repatriate the funds in the most tax efficient manner from those subsidiaries. Repatriation of foreign cash is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the time of cash distribution. However, foreign earnings may still be taxed for state income tax purposes, as well as subject to certain foreign withholding tax obligations, when cash amounts are distributed back to the U.S. 
 Our liquidity requirements include interest payments related to our debt structure. As reported, our cash interest paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 37.0 million and 28.5 million, respectively. Before any impact of hedges, a one percent change in assumed interest rates for our variable interest credit facilities would have an annual impact of approximately 8.7 million on interest expense. 
 We hedge the interest rate fluctuations on debt obligations through interest rate cap agreements. For more information about our interest rate cap agreements, refer to Note 12 Financial Instruments of our condensed consolidated financials statements included in Part 1, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited). 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements include 3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit on our ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024.

 Cash Flow 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 106.4 73.4 Investing activities (56.2) (53.6) Financing activities (15.1) (90.5) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1.9) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 35.1 (72.6) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 88.4 110.9 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 123.5 38.3 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 106.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash generated by operating activities, other than changes in working capital, was higher by 13.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to dividends received from the Zeolyst Joint Venture. The increase in cash from working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 19.5 million was favorable compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to favorable changes in receivables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by unfavorable changes in inventories, prepaids and other current assets and accounts payable. 
 The favorable change in receivables was driven by the timing of collection of sales. The favorable change in accrued liabilities mainly relates to the timing of payments for variable employee compensation liabilities and non-trade payables from related parties. The unfavorable change in inventory was primarily due to the timing of sales orders and inventory build. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was due to the timing of vendor payments. The unfavorable change in prepaid and other current assets primarily relates to the timing of prepaid expenses and non-trade receivables from related parties. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 56.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53.6 million during the same period in 2023. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of 51.7 million and 53.6 million to fund capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company paid 4.5 million to complete a minority equity investment in Pajarito during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 90.5 million during the same period in 2023. Net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the lower repurchases of the Company s common stock of 73.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Debt 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) 2024 Term Loan Facility 873.0 877.5 ABL Facility Total debt 873.0 877.5 Original issue discount (7.4) (6.2) Deferred financing costs (2.9) (3.4) Total debt, net of original issue discount and deferred financing costs 862.7 867.9 Less: current portion (8.7) (9.0) Total long-term debt, excluding current portion 854.0 858.9 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 873.0 million, excluding the original issue discount of 7.4 million and deferred financing costs of 2.9 million for our senior secured credit facilities. Our net debt as of September 30, 2024 was 749.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 123.5 million. We may seek, subject to market conditions and other factors, opportunities to repurchase, refinance or otherwise reprice our debt.

 Capital Expenditures 
 Maintenance capital expenditures include spending on maintenance of business, health, safety and environmental initiatives. Growth capital expenditures include spending to drive organic sales growth and cost savings initiatives. These capital expenditures represent our book capital expenditures for which the company has recorded, but not necessarily paid for the capital expenditures. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Maintenance capital expenditures 40.4 42.6 Growth capital expenditures 9.5 5.1 Total capital expenditures 49.9 47.7 
 Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain expansion growth initiatives during these periods. Maintenance capital expenditures were lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to extended turnaround activities and additional expenditures incurred related to Winter Storm Elliott impacting our manufacturing facilities in 2023. Growth capital expenditures were higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the planned expansion of the Kansas City, Kansas silica catalyst production facility. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP and our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 While there has been no material change in our critical accounting policies and use of estimates from those described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we continually evaluate our critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. The Company completes its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if triggering events indicate a possible impairment. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using both a market approach and an income, or discounted cash flow, approach. As of October 1, 2023, the date of the Company s most recent quantitative assessments, the fair values of each of the Company s reporting units and the fair values of the Company s indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks exceeded their respective carrying values. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company s reporting units or intangible assets below their respective carrying values. 
 Although the estimated fair value of the Advanced Materials Catalysts reporting unit exceeded its carrying value on October 1, 2023 by over 30 , the Company has experienced unfavorable effects on current operations resulting from certain macroeconomic and industry factors in specific end uses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prolonged unfavorable effects could adversely impact the estimated fair value of the Advanced Materials Catalysts reporting unit in future periods and may result in impairment charges. 
 Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their effect on us.

Table of Contents 

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Our major market risk exposure is potential losses arising from changing rates and prices regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. The audit committee of our board of directors regularly reviews foreign exchange and interest rate activity, and monitors compliance with our hedging policy. We do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes, and we limit our hedging activity to the underlying economic exposure. 
 There have been no material changes in the foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk or credit risk discussed in Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, a s of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or which are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal claims and proceedings incidental to the normal conduct of business, relating to such matters as personal injury, product liability and warranty claims, waste disposal practices, release of chemicals into the environment and other matters that may arise in the ordinary course of our business. We currently believe that there is no litigation pending that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a discussion of our risk factors. There have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 229.6 million was available for share repurchases under the program. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or executive officers , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, each as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
