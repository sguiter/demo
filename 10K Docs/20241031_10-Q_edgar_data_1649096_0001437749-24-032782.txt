 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (In thousands, except for share and per share data and as noted) 

 (Unaudited) 

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Clipper Realty Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or we and subsidiaries have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading when read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Note that any references to square footage and unit count are outside the scope of our Independent registered public accounting firm s review. 

The financial information presented reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the interim periods presented. These results are not necessarily indicative of a full year s results of operations.

The operations of Clipper Realty Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are carried on primarily through Clipper Realty L.P., the Company s operating partnership subsidiary (the "Operating Partnership ). The Company has elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code ). The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership is the sole managing member of the limited liability companies (the "LLCs that comprised the predecessor of the Company (the "Predecessor ). 

At September 30, 2024, the Company s interest, through the Operating Partnership, in the LLCs that own the properties generally entitles it to of the aggregate cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the LLCs. 

The Company determined that the Operating Partnership and the LLCs are variable interest entities VIEs and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs represented substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities. 

In accordance with ASU 2018-01, "Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business, the Company evaluates each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate to determine if the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and needs to be accounted for as a business combination. If either of the following criteria is met, the integrated set of assets and activities acquired would not qualify as a business: 

Substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets or 

The integrated set of assets and activities is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e., revenue generated before and after the transaction). 

An acquired process is considered substantive if: 

The process includes an organized workforce (or includes an acquired contract that provides access to an organized workforce) that is skilled, knowledgeable and experienced in performing the process: 

The process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay or 

The process is considered unique or scarce. 

Generally, the Company expects that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings and related intangible assets) or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. 

Upon acquisition of real estate, the Company assesses the fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, in-place leases and any other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities. The Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. In estimating fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Company assesses and considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs, net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 

The Company records acquired above-market and below-market lease values initially based on the present value, using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired based on the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed renewal options for the below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values (if any) that are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A property s value is impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded and measured by the amount of the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset. In the event that the Company obtains proceeds through an insurance policy due to impairment, the proceeds are offset against the write-down in calculating gain/loss on disposal of assets. Management of the Company does not believe that any of its properties within the portfolio are impaired as of September 30, 2024. 

For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the assets less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the assets. Properties classified as real estate held-for-sale generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held-for-sale is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value less cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held-for-sale properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations and replacements related to held-for-sale properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held-for-sale. 

If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balances of the related intangibles are written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized to expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). 

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

- 

Tenant improvements 

Shorter of useful life or lease term 

Furniture, fixtures and equipment (in years) 

- 

The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction to base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. 

and , respectively, for residential receivables not deemed probable of collection and recognized revenue of and , respectively, for a reassessment of collectability of residential receivables previously not deemed probable of collection. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company charged revenue in the amount of and , respectively, for residential receivables not deemed probable of collection and recognized revenue of and , respectively, for a reassessment of collectability of residential receivables previously not deemed probable of collection. 

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 842, rental revenue for commercial leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Deferred rents receivable represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with lease agreements. Rental income attributable to residential leases and parking is recognized as earned, which is not materially different from the straight-line basis. Leases entered by residents for apartment units are generally for one-year terms, renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. 

Reimbursements for operating expenses due from tenants pursuant to their lease agreements are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. These costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance costs and other recoverable costs and are recorded as part of commercial rental income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there was million and million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under share incentive plans. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation expense will be recorded is approximately three and a half years. 

In March 2024, the Company granted employees and non-employee directors and LTIP units, respectively, with a weighted-average grant date value of per unit. The grants vesting period range from up to one year for those granted to the non-employee directors and from one to years to those granted to employees as 2023 bonus and long-term incentive compensation. 

In March 2023, the Company granted employees and non-employee directors and LTIP units, respectively, with a weighted-average grant date value of per unit. The grants vesting period range from up to one year for those granted to the non-employee directors and from one to years to those granted to employees as 2022 bonus and long-term incentive compensation.

of the REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains) to its stockholders, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to matters such as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it is generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate-level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and any applicable alternative minimum tax. In addition, the Company may not be able to re-elect as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. The entities comprising the Predecessor are limited liability companies and are treated as pass-through entities for income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal, state or local income or franchise taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and, as such, does not have any uncertain tax positions that, if successfully challenged, could result in a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. The prior three years income tax returns are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service. 

Class B LLC units outstanding is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. The net loss allocable to such units is reflected as non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On November 27, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 to require the disclosure of segment expenses if they are (i) significant to the segment, (ii) regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), and (iii) included in each reported measure of a segment s profit or loss. Public entities will be required to provide this disclosure quarterly. In addition, this ASU requires an annual disclosure of the CODM s title and a description of how the CODM uses the segment s profit/loss measure to assess segment performance and to allocate resources. Compliance with these and certain other disclosure requirements will be required for our annual report on Form 10-K for the year 2024, and for subsequent quarterly and annual reports, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our current disclosures.

As of February 23, 2024, the City of New York notified the Company of its intention to terminate its lease for square feet of office space located at 240-250 Livingston Street effective August 23, 2025. The Lease generally provides for rent payments in the amount of through the end of the term. Additionally, the Company and the City of New York are negotiating the terms of a five-year extension of its current square foot lease at 141 Livingston Street that expires in December of 2025.

The financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, security deposits and notes payable. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and security deposits reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the notes payable are as follows:

million, the court agreed with the Company s legal arguments that rendered the overcharge liability lower than it could have been, and therefore the Company did not appeal the ruling. On June 23, 2022, the court ruled that the plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys fees incurred through February 28, 2022, in the amount of million. The only remaining outstanding issues of which the Company is aware relate to the proper form of rent-stabilized renewal leases for the six plaintiffs who remain as tenants in the building. The parties are seeking judicial intervention to resolve this remaining issue. On July 17, 2023, a hearing was held at which the Judicial Hearing Officer JHO determined five (5) of the tenant s lease renewal amounts, term and form. The amount of the lease renewal concerning the sixth plaintiff was made on August 28, 2023. On June 14, 2024, the Court amended its August 28, 2023 decision, holding that no renewal lease had been entered into by one of the remaining tenants who claimed to have entered into a renewal lease at a preferential rent. On July 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the June 14, 2024 decision. Renewal leases for certain of the remaining tenants are outstanding. 

On November 18, 2019, the same law firm which filed the Kuzmich case filed a second action involving a separate group of 26 tenants (captioned Crowe et al v 50 Murray Street Acquisition LLC, Supreme Court, New York County, Index No. 161227/19), which action advances essentially the same claims as in Kuzmich. The Company s deadline to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint in Crowe had been extended to June 30, 2020; on such date, the Company filed its answer to the complaint. Pursuant to the court s rules, on July 16, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint; the sole difference as compared to the initial complaint is that seven new plaintiffs-tenants were added to the caption; there were no substantive changes to the complaint s allegations. On August 5, 2020, the Company filed its answer to the amended complaint. The case was placed on the court s calendar and was next scheduled for a discovery conference on November 16, 2022. Counsel for the parties have been engaged in and are continuing settlement discussions. On November 16, 2022, the court held a compliance conference and ordered the plaintiffs to provide rent overcharge calculations in response to proposed calculations previously provided by the Company. On July 12, 2023, the court referred this matter to a JHO to determine the outstanding issues. A hearing before the JHO was held in September 2023 in which the Company and Plaintiffs produced their rent overcharge calculations. In addition, on November 28, 2023, the Court denied the motion for use and occupancy against one of the tenants based on a technical error in Plaintiffs amended complaint. The Plaintiff has filed with the Court to correct its error. At this time all parties are continuing to engage in settlement discussions and discussions with the JHO seeking to resolve differences between their rent calculations. 

On March 9, 2021, the same law firm which filed the Kuzmich and Crowe cases filed a third action involving another tenant (captioned Horn v 50 Murray Street Acquisition LLC, Supreme Court, New York County, Index No. 152415/21), which action advances the same claims as in Kuzmich and Crowe. The Company filed its answer to the complaint on May 21, 2021. A preliminary conference was held in December 2023 to discuss the calculations for the Horn lease renewal. The parties are currently attempting to settle this matter before the same JHO as in the hearing for the Kuzmich and Crowe matters. 

As a result of the March 4 and May 9, 2022 decisions which established the probability and ability to reasonably compute amounts owed to tenants for all the cases, the Company recorded a charge for litigation settlement and other of million in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 comprising rent overcharges, interest and legal costs of plaintiff s counsel. The Company paid million to the plaintiffs related to the Kuzmich case during the year ended December 31, 2022 and million related to the Crowe case during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. 

In addition to the above, the Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with its business. Management believes, based in part upon consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

The New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services is currently engaged in an audit of the Company s operating expense escalation charges for the period of June 2014 to December 2018. Based on the preliminary results of the audit the Company believes it has adequate reserves to cover any adverse conclusions. 

Commitments 

On June 29, 2023, the Company entered into the Article 11 Agreement. Under this agreement, the Company has entered into a Housing Repair and Maintenance Letter Agreement in which the Company has agreed to perform certain capital improvements to Flatbush Gardens over the next 3 years. The current estimate is that the costs of that work will be an amount up to . The Company expects those costs to be offset by the savings provided by a real estate tax exemption and enhanced payments for tenants receiving government assistance. Through September 30, 2024 the Company spent approximately on capital improvements required under the HRMLA. 

The Company is obligated to provide parking availability through August 2025 under a lease with a tenant at the 250 Livingston Street property; the current cost to the Company is approximately per year.

Revenue .

Revenue . Residential rental income increased to 76,752 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 72,529 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in rental rates and leased occupancy at all properties partially offset by higher bad debt expense. For example, base rent per square foot increased at the Tribeca House property to 82.39 (99.8 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2024, from 78.22 (98.2 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2023, the Flatbush Gardens property to 29.07 (98.6 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2024, from 26.62 (98.6 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2023 and the 1010 Pacific Street property to 62.67 (96.6 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2024, from 58.20 (93.2 leased occupancy) at September 30, 2023. 

25

Commercial rental income increased to 28,974 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 28,845 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher property tax reimbursement income at our Livingston office properties, partially offset by lower rents at our Tribeca House and slightly higher bad debt expense. 

Property operating expenses . Property operating expenses include property-level costs such as compensation costs for property-level personnel, repairs and maintenance, supplies, utilities and landscaping. Property operating expenses increased to 25,417 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 22,353 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher apartment repairs costs at Flatbush Gardens to prepare units for leasing, higher payroll costs at Flatbush Gardens due to the living wage requirement from the Article 11 transaction, higher utilities and water and sewer cost and higher tenant legal costs slightly offset by lower supplies expense. 

Real estate taxes and insurance . Real estate taxes and insurance expenses decreased to 22,212 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 24,373 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the real estate tax exemption at Flatbush Gardens that began July 1, 2023, partially offset by increased real estate taxes at the remainder of the portfolio and higher insurance costs across the portfolio. 

General and administrative . General and administrative expenses increased to 10,050 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 9,831 for the September months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher payroll expenses, partially offset by lower accounting fees in the period ended September 30, 2024 due to higher fees that were incurred in the period ended September 30, 2023 in relation to the separation from our prior auditor. 

Transaction pursuit costs . Transaction pursuit costs primarily reflect costs incurred in respect of the entry into the Article 11 Agreement during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 21,226 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 20,524 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the additions to real estate across the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net, increased to 31,474 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 31,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased interest at the 10 West 65th Street as a result of the interest rate changing from fixed to a floating rate in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

Loss on modification/extinguishment of debt. Loss on the extinguishment of debt consists of costs related to the early termination of our construction loan at 1010 Pacific. Additionally, we accelerated the remaining unamortized loan costs from the prior loan. 

Net loss . As a result of the foregoing, net loss decreased to 4,653 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 11,272 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,258 million indebtedness, net of unamortized issuance costs, secured by our properties, 18.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, and 17.5 million of restricted cash. See Note 4, Notes Payable of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company s property-level debt. 

Our short-term liquidity needs will primarily be to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance, interest and scheduled debt principal payments, general and administrative expenses, and distributions to stockholders and unit holders. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to stockholders on an annual basis. 

In connection with the notice of termination of the City of New York lease at our 250 Livingston Street property and pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement described in Note 4, our available cash will be impacted by the establishment of a cash management account for the benefit of the Lender, which the Company expects to establish shortly, into which the Company will be obligated to deposit all revenue generated by the property. Additionally, the Company and the City of New York are negotiating the terms of a five-year extension of its current lease at 141 Livingston Street upon its termination in December of 2025. There can be no assurance that the negotiations will conclude with an agreement. Should the lease not be extended for a minimum of five years, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage note, the Company will be required to either fund an escrow account in the amount of 10,000 payable in equal monthly payments over the 18 months after lease expiration or deliver to the lender a letter of credit in the amount of 10,000. The loan servicer has, we believe, erroneously interpreted the loan agreement to require that the monthly payments begin July 2024 and we continue to discuss this issue with the servicer. 

On October 28, 2024 we received notice that as of October 7, 2024 the servicing of the mortgage note was transferred to a special servicer Special Servicer due to, they contend, our failure to make certain required payments under the loan, including, but not limited to, the reserve monthly deposit. The Special Servicer has demanded that we pay 2,222 of reserve payments into an escrow account immediately and continued monthly payments of 555 for an additional 14 months, 1,166 of default interest and late charges through October 7, 2024, and an additional 10 per diem interest for each day thereafter. We contend the Special Servicer has misinterpreted the terms of the loan agreement requiring monthly reserve payments beginning on July 7, 2024, and that the Company has no obligation to make reserve payments at this time under the terms of the loan agreement. We continue to discuss this issue with the Special Servicer. 

Our principal long-term liquidity needs will primarily be to fund additional property acquisitions, major renovations and upgrading projects, leasehold improvements at the 250 Livingston property upon identification of a new tenant following move-out of the existing City of New York tenant, and debt payments at maturity and funding a 10,000 escrow and other payments discussed above, related to the 141 Livingston Street property if the Company we and the City of New York are unable to agree to terms of the lease extension and we and the Special Servicer are unable to agree on the terms of the loan agreement related to such property. 

We generally expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements by using by cash on hand, as well as cash provided by operations, sales of certain properties, long-term secured or unsecured debt offerings and/or funds from public or private equity offerings. However, we cannot provide assurance that this will be the case. Our ability to secure additional debt will depend on a number of factors, including our cash flow from operations, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will depend on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. 

26

We believe that our current cash flows from operations and cash on hand coupled with sales of certain properties, long-term secured or unsecured debt offerings and/or funds from public or private equity offerings, will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations, satisfy our contractual obligations and make distributions to our stockholders and the members of our LLC subsidiaries for at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness in the future on favorable terms or at all. 

Distributions 

In order to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must currently distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders. On August 1, 2024 the company declared dividends and distributions on our common shares, Class B LLC units and LTIP units totaling 4.4 million paid on August 22, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid dividends and distributions on our common shares, Class B LLC units and LTIP units totaling 4.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively.

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was 21,337 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17,130 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating cash flows in the period ended September 30, 2024 from September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in revenues net of slightly higher expenses. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 57,097 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27,783 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher capital spending for the Dean Street development of 34,689 and higher capital spending at Flatbush Gardens of 5,857, partially offset by decreased spending at 1010 Pacific Street of 9,759. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 35,629 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash was provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by 50,300 borrowings related to the Dean Street property, partially offset by 1,483 of amortization payments and dividend and distributions of 13,189. Cash was provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, by 40,617 refinancing the 1010 Pacific Street and Dean Street property loans, partially offset by scheduled debt amortization payments, 9,921 of loan extinguishment and issuance costs, and 13,044 of dividends and distributions. 

Income Taxes 

No provision has been made for income taxes since all of the Company s operations are held in pass-through entities and accordingly the income or loss of the Company is included in the individual income tax returns of the partners or members. 

We elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our first taxable three months ended March 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. We believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify and be taxed as a REIT and we intend to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 

Inflation 

Inflation has recently become a factor in the United States economy and has increased the cost of acquiring, developing, replacing and operating properties. A substantial portion of our interest costs relating to operating properties are fixed through 2027. Leases at our residential rental properties, which comprise approximately 74 of our revenue, are short-term in nature and permit rent increases to recover increased costs, and our longer-term commercial and retail leases generally allow us to recover some increased operating costs. 

27

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we disclose and discuss funds from operations FFO ), adjusted funds from operations AFFO ), adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and net operating income NOI ), all of which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. 

While management and the investment community in general believe that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors, neither FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, nor NOI should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income from operations as an indication of our performance. We believe that to understand our performance further, FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and NOI should be compared with our reported net income (loss) or income from operations and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. 

Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations 

FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment adjustments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by NAREIT. 

AFFO is defined by us as FFO excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles incurred in property acquisitions, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization costs incurred in originating debt, interest rate cap mark-to-market adjustments, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, loss on modification/extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, gain on termination of lease and certain litigation-related expenses, less recurring capital spending. 

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. FFO is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income. We consider FFO useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance. We further consider AFFO useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations computed in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to net income (loss) as reliable measures of our operating performance; nor should you consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity. 

Neither FFO nor AFFO measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Further, FFO and AFFO as disclosed by other REITs might not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and AFFO. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the Company s FFO and AFFO for the periods presented to net loss, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization 

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before allocation to non-controlling interests, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of identifiable intangibles, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, interest expense (net), acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, loss on modification/extinguishment of debt and certain litigation-related expenses, less gain on involuntary conversion and gain on termination of lease. 

We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income (loss). We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful financial measure of our core operating performance. 

However, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Adjusted EBITDA, and accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other REITs.

Net Operating Income 

We believe that NOI is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as income from operations plus real estate depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition and other costs, transaction pursuit costs, amortization of identifiable intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, less gain on termination of lease. We believe that this measure is widely recognized and provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income (loss). We use NOI to evaluate our performance because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our company by measuring the core operations of property performance and capturing trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. NOI is also a widely used metric in valuation of properties. 

However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of NOI for the periods presented to income from operations, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that there have been no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

29

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our future income, cash flows and fair value relevant to our financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Based upon the nature of our operations, the principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control, contribute to interest rate risk. 

A one percent change in interest rates on our 132.0 million of variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024, would impact annual net loss by approximately 1.3 million. 

At September 30, 2024, there were no interest rate caps for the Company s outstanding debt. 

The fair value of the Company s notes payable was approximately 1,196.7 million and 1,160.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, and summarized, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 

We continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The risk factors disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, set forth information relating to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and operating results. Such risk factors continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results, and there have been no material changes to those risk factors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. except for the following updates: 

We depend on certain agencies of the City of New York, as a single government tenant in our office buildings, which could cause an adverse effect on us, including our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow when these agencies opt to early terminate or opt not to renew their leases. 

Our rental revenue depends on entering into leases with and collecting rents from tenants. As of September 30, 2024, Kings County Court, the Human Resources Administration, and the Department of Environmental Protection, all of which are agencies of the City of New York, leased an aggregate of 548,580 rentable square feet of commercial space at our commercial office properties at 141 Livingston Street and 250 Livingston Street, representing approximately 22 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

As of February 23, 2024, The City of New York, a municipal corporation acting through the Department of Citywide Administrative Services NYC ), notified us of its intention to terminate its lease at 250 Livingston Street effective August 23, 2025. The lease generally provides for rent payments in the amount of 15.4 million per annum. The Company may be unable to replace NYC as a tenant or unable to replace them with other commercial tenants at comparable rent rates, may incur substantial costs to improve the vacated space or may have to offer significant inducements to fill the space, all of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In connection with the termination of the 250 Livingston lease, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement related to 125 million building mortgage, we expect to establish shortly a cash management account for the benefit of the lender, into which we will be obligated to deposit all revenue generated by the building at 250 Livingston Street. All amounts remaining in such cash management account after the lender s allocations set forth in the loan agreement will be disbursed to us once the tenant cure conditions are satisfied under the loan agreement. If we are unable to replace the NYC lease at comparable rents, we may not be able to cure the conditions listed in the loan agreement. If the excess cash is not released to us, it could impact our available cash to fund corporate operations and pay dividends and distributions to our stockholders. 

If NYC were to decide not to renew the 141 Livingston Street lease which expires December 27, 2025, which is the stated termination date pursuant to the terms of the lease, we would be at risk of not being able to replace the NYC as a tenant, leasing the space below the current rates, incurring costs to improve the space or offer other inducements to fill the space, all of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If we are not able to extend or replace the NYC lease at our 141 Livingston property for a minimum of a five year term, we will be required to either fund an escrow account in the amount of 10,000 payable in equal monthly payments over the 18 months after lease expiration or deliver to the lender a letter of credit in the amount of 10,000. 

In addition, on October 28, 2024 we received notice that as of October 7, 2024 the servicing of the mortgage note was transferred to a special servicer Special Servicer due to, they contend, our failure to make certain required payments under the loan, including, but not limited to, the reserve monthly deposit. The Special Servicer has demanded that we pay 2,222 of reserve payments into an escrow account immediately and continued monthly payments of 555 for an additional 14 months, 1,166 of default interest and late charges through October 7, 2024, and an additional 10 per diem interest for each day thereafter. We contend the Special Servicer has misinterpreted the terms of the loan agreement requiring monthly reserve payments beginning on July 7, 2024, and that the Company has no obligation to make reserve payments at this time under the terms of the loan agreement. We continue to discuss this issue with the Special Servicer.
