 Amortizing intangible assets Customer relationships and intellectual property During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we reorganized our reporting units in the Refrigerated Frozen and Grocery Snacks segments. This required us to reassign assets and liabilities between the reporting units, assess whether there were indicators of impairment for the impacted reporting units, and evaluate other assets in the reporting units for impairment, including indefinite-lived intangibles (brand names and trademarks). The fair value of our reporting units is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow method. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using the "relief from royalty" methodology. Both the relief from royalty methodology and the discounted cash flow method require us to estimate the future cash flows as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for a reporting unit over a discrete period (typically five years) and a terminal period (considering expected long-term growth rates and trends). We used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate that ranged between to in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates in areas such as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows, discount rates, or terminal growth rates could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value. As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized impairment charges in SG A expenses of million within our Grocery Snacks and Refrigerated Frozen segments for certain brands that continued to have lower than expected sales and profit margins. There were impairments to goodwill. Amortizing intangible assets carry a remaining weighted average life of approximately . Amortization expense was million and million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, and million and million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024, respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 24, 2024, amortization expense is estimated to average million for each of the next five years. million gain in accumulated other comprehensive income that is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. The unamortized amount at November 24, 2024 was million. Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately.

In the first half of fiscal 2025, we granted million restricted stock units at a weighted average grant date price of per share unit and million performance shares at a weighted average grant date price of per share. Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals for the three -year performance periods ending in fiscal 2025 (the 2025 performance period and 2026 (the 2026 performance period are based on our net sales and diluted earnings per share EPS growth, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period, with each year of the performance period weighted one-third.

Dividend equivalents are paid on the portion of performance shares actually earned at our regular dividend rate in additional shares of common stock. Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

The effective tax rate in the first half of fiscal 2025 reflected the above-cited items, as well as a million deferred tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances booked against certain deferred tax assets. Recent interactions with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain elections that had previously been under IRS review make the realization of certain deferred tax assets likely. The realization of these deferred tax assets allows for both current and future tax deductions through 2036.

 million were recognized with associated tax benefit. We have previously made the assessment that the current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested or that we could not remit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of million on approximately million of cumulative earnings as of November 24, 2024.

For example, during fiscal 2024, a jury entered a verdict against the Company for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages in one of these lawsuits captioned Reese v. Conagra Brands, Inc., et al. Reese . We have appealed the judgment in the Reese lawsuit. These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety warnings of our cooking spray products and we have denied liability, however, we cannot predict with certainty the results of these proceedings. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for the litigation related to the cooking spray products based on information available to us at the time of our evaluation.

 Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, results reflected a slight decline in net sales, with an organic (excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange) increase in our Grocery Snacks segment and flat net sales in our Refrigerated Frozen segment that were more than offset by decreases in our Foodservice and International segments, in each case compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Overall gross profit was flat as the impacts of input cost inflation and unfavorable operating leverage were offset by productivity and lower transportation costs. Overall segment operating profit decreased in our Refrigerated Frozen and Foodservice segments, slightly offset by an increase in our Grocery Snacks and International segments. Corporate expenses were lower and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were higher primarily due to items impacting comparability, as discussed below. We recognized lower equity method investment earnings, lower interest expense, and lower income tax expense, in each case compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was lower than the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was affected by slightly lower net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Trends Impacting Our Business Our industry continues to be impacted by shifting consumer behavior, commodity cost fluctuations, exchange rate volatility, labor cost inflation, input cost inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other global macroeconomic challenges. During the first half of fiscal 2025, we experienced a moderate amount of input cost inflation and negative impacts from exchange rates, which we were able to partially offset through our on-going productivity initiatives. We expect consumer trends to continue to evolve and our volumes to improve over time, however, economic pressures on consumers, including the challenges of high inflation, may continue to negatively impact our volumes throughout fiscal 2025. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. Items Impacting Comparability Segment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in further detail in Note 8, Derivative Financial Instruments , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. We had 10.9 million of derivative gains and 11.2 million of derivative losses in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 9.6 million and 16.4 million of derivative gains in the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which were included in general corporate expenses and reflected as items impacting comparability.

 Net sales for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025 in our Grocery Snacks segment included an increase in price/mix of 0.9 and 0.4 , respectively, excluding the impact of acquisitions, when compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024. Price/mix was impacted by favorable brand mix and favorability in inflation-driven pricing, partially offset by an increase in strategic trade investments. Volume increased by 0.3 for the second quarter of 2025 when compared to the second quarter of 2024. Volume decreased by 0.7 for the first half of 2025 when compared to the first half of 2024, primarily due to the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions, partially offset by improved consumption trends in the current quarter. The acquisitions of Sweetwood Smoke Co. in August 2024 and an existing co-manufacturer of our cooking spray products in July 2024 contributed 10.9 million and 13.6 million to our Grocery Snacks segment net sales during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, respectively. Net sales for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025 in our Refrigerated Frozen segment reflected a decrease in price/mix of 1.9 and 3.7 , respectively, when compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in strategic trade investments. Volume increased by 1.9 and 1.1 for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, when compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024 due to improved consumption trends and strategic investments in certain brands. Additionally, we estimate that net sales during the first half of fiscal 2025 were impacted by approximately 24 million due to temporary manufacturing disruptions in our Hebrew National business during the key grilling season. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 in our International segment reflected a 3.8 decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a 2.4 decrease in volumes, and a 1.7 increase in price/mix, in each case compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The unfavorable foreign exchange rates were primarily due to the devaluation of the Mexican Peso relative to the US dollar and volume decreases were driven by lower consumption trends in our Canadian business. The second quarter of fiscal 2024 included 24.5 million of net sales related to our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited ATFL ), which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2025 in our International segment reflected a 3.6 decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a 3.1 increase in price/mix, and a 1.9 decrease in volumes, in each case compared to the first half of fiscal 2024. The unfavorable foreign exchange rates were primarily due to the devaluation of the Mexican Peso relative to the US dollar. The first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024 included 23.6 million and 48.5 million, respectively, of net sales related to ATFL. Net sales for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025 in our Foodservice segment reflected a decrease in volumes of 3.9 and 7.5 , respectively, excluding the impact of acquisitions, when compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024. The decrease in volumes was driven by the ongoing impact of lost business from the prior year and ongoing softness in restaurant traffic. Price/mix increased by 2.9 and 3.1 , compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2024, respectively, reflecting inflation-driven pricing and the value-over-volume strategy. Additionally, we estimate that net sales in our Foodservice segment during the first half of fiscal 2025 were impacted by approximately 3 million due to the temporary manufacturing disruptions in our Hebrew National business. SG A Expenses (includes general corporate expenses) SG A expenses totaled 444.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 46.0 million, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 17.8 and 26.5 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately (11.5) and 24.9 for the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 12, Income Taxes , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 1.57 and 1.26, respectively. The increase reflected higher net income in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal 2024. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts and other payables, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We strive to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Borrowing Facilities and Long-Term Debt At November 24, 2024, we had a revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of 2.0 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 2.5 billion with the consent of the lenders). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The Company may request the term of the Revolving Credit Facility be extended for additional one-year or two-year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of November 24, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of November 24, 2024, we had 849.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of borrowings outstanding during the first half of fiscal 2025 was 1.0 billion. We had 586.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of May 26, 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we prepaid the remaining outstanding 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured term loan (the Term Loan ). The repayment was primarily funded by operating cash flows. For additional information about our long-term debt balances, refer to Note 5, Debt and Revolving Credit Facility , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report and Note 3, Long-Term Debt , to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. The weighted average coupon interest rate of long-term debt obligations outstanding as of November 24, 2024 was approximately 4.9 .

 We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance long-term debt at maturity or otherwise, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, access to the capital markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility. We continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt; however, any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors, including financing options that may be available to us from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible. Our most restrictive debt agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded net debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0. Each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of November 24, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Equity and Dividends We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. Under our current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of 64.0 million. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The Company s total remaining share repurchase authorization as of November 24, 2024 was 852.6 million. On November 27, 2024, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its common stock of 0.35 per share to stockholders of record as of close of business on October 31, 2024. On December 12, 2024, we announced that our Board had authorized a quarterly dividend of 0.35 per share to be paid on February 27, 2025, to stockholders of record as of close of business on January 27, 2025. Contractual Obligations As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, discussed above, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and unconditional purchase obligations. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we entered into a warehousing service agreement with obligations totaling approximately 187 million over a term of 10 years. There were no other material changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. Capital Expenditures We continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 is approximately 450 million. Cash Flows During the first half of fiscal 2025, we used 41.6 million of cash, which was the net result of 754.2 million generated from operating activities, 366.0 million used in investing activities, 425.2 million used in financing activities, and a decrease of 4.6 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cash generated from operating activities totaled 754.2 million and 854.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows for the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower operating profits and lower dividend payments received from one of our equity method investments partially offset by the timing of payments of accounts payable and the accelerated receipt of our outstanding receivables. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we utilized certain customer payment term offerings to accelerate receipt on our outstanding receivables in exchange for a slightly higher prompt pay discount, which increased our cash flow from operations by approximately 155 million. Operating cash flows in the first half of fiscal 2025 also benefited from lower tax payments as a result of recent interactions with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS allowing for additional tax deductions.

 Cash used in investing activities totaled 366.0 million and 203.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Investing activities in the first half of fiscal 2025 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 215.4 million, and the purchases of an existing co-manufacturer and Sweetwood Smoke Co. for a total of 230.6 million, net of cash acquired, which were partially offset by net proceeds totaling 76.8 million from the sale of our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited ATFL ). Investing activities in the first half of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling 214.0 million. Cash used in financing activities totaled 425.2 million and 683.4 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2025 principally reflected repayments of long-term debt of 270.2 million, cash dividends paid of 335.1 million, and common stock repurchases of 64.0 million partially offset by net short-term borrowing issuances of 264.4 million. Financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2024 principally reflected repayments of long-term debt of 760.6 million, the issuance of long-term debt totaling 500.0 million, net short-term borrowing repayments of 81.2 million, and cash dividends paid of 324.7 million. Cash Held by International Subsidiaries The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 37.4 million at November 24, 2024 and 77.7 million at May 26, 2024, of which 28.3 million at November 24, 2024 and 66.7 million at May 26, 2024 was held in foreign countries. A deferred tax liability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Other undistributed foreign earnings are invested indefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those earnings. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For further discussion of our critical accounting estimates, please refer to the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting us are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. Other than the changes noted below, there have been no material changes in our market risk during the twenty-six weeks ended November 24, 2024. For additional information, refer to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. Commodity Market Risk We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, vegetable oils, pork, dairy products, and energy to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions. Interest Rate Risk We may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt. The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was 7.27 billion as of November 24, 2024. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt at November 24, 2024 was estimated at 7.12 billion. As of November 24, 2024, a 1 increase in the interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 340.6 million, while a 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 382.7 million. Foreign Currency Risk In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

 Effect of Hypothetical 10 Fluctuation The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and foreign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions): 

Fair Value Impact In Millions November 24, 2024 November 26, 2023 Energy commodities 2.1 1.9 Agriculture commodities 7.8 6.5 Foreign exchange 8.3 8.6 It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of November 24, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 24, 2024 and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended November 24, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
