The
timing of revenue recognition, billings and collections results in accounts receivables, unbilled receivables or contract assets and
contract liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Under typical payment terms for our contracts accounted for over time, amounts
are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual
milestones.

NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Under
ASC 606, payments received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to-date results in a contract liability. These contract liabilities
are not considered to represent a significant financing component of the contract because we believe these cash advances and deposits
are generally used to meet working capital demands which can be higher in the earlier stages of a contract. Also, advanced payments and
deposits provide us with some measure of assurance that the customer will perform on its obligations under the contract. 

Contract
assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from system sales under contracts and represents revenue recognized that exceeds
the amount billed to the customer. 

Contract
liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. The Company typically receives down payments upon
receipt of orders and progress payments as the system is manufactured. 

Contract
assets and contract liabilities are classified as current as these contracts in progress are expected to be substantially completed within
the next twelve months. 

Point
in time 

For
non-system sales of products and services, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the promised products or services
is transferred to the Company s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in
exchange for those products or services (the transaction price). A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct
product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

For
any system equipment sales where the equipment would have an alternative use or where the contract provisions of the contract preclude
the use of over time revenue recognition, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the equipment is transferred to
the customer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all system equipment sales were recorded over time by
using an input method except for one PVT200 system that was recorded at the point in time when the equipment was transferred to the customer
during the third quarter of 2024. There was one system equipment contract in 2023 where the revenue was to be recognized based on point
in time. This contract was modified during the three months ended September 30, 2023 such that the revenue under this contract will be
recognized over time using an input method based on the revised contract provisions. Revenues for the three months ended September 30,
2023 includes million of revenue that was deferred as of June 30, 2023 and recognized on the date of the contract modification.

months. Cash equivalents consisting of U.S. treasury bills were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. 

The
Company places most of its temporary cash investments in the United States with financial institutions, which from time to time may exceed
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. The amount at risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and million,
respectively. 

Accounts
receivable 

The
Company sells products and services to various companies across several industries in the ordinary course of business. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations to assess the probability of accounts receivable collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction
experience, evaluation of their credit history and review of the invoicing terms of the contract to determine the financial strength
of its customers. 

Accounts
receivables are presented net of an allowance for credit losses of approximately at both September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023. The allowance is based on prior experience and management s evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable. Measurement
of credit losses requires consideration of historical loss experience, including the need to adjust for changing business conditions,
and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates
and the financial health of specific customers. Future changes to the estimated allowance for credit losses could be material to our
results of operations and financial condition.

Executive
Summary 

We
have served the advanced materials markets with chemical vapor and thermal process equipment for over 40 years. CVD designs, develops,
and manufactures a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control, and other state-of-the-art equipment and process solutions
used to develop, produce and grow materials and coatings for commercial applications and research. To learn more about CVD s systems
and offerings, visit www.cvdequipment.com. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Revenue
 increased by 2.0 million or 31.4 for the third quarter as compared to the prior year period due to increases in revenues from aerospace
 contracts in progress, our SDC segment and final sales by our MesoScribe subsidiary partially offset by lower revenues of spare parts. 

Gross
 margin increased by 0.2 million or 14.8 in the third quarter as compared to the prior period quarter due to higher revenues and
 improved margins on contracts in process offset by a 1.0 million non-cash charge to reduce certain PVT inventory to net realizable
 value. 

Total
 bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were approximately 4.1 million as compared to 4.4 million in the prior year period. 

Total
 bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 21.0 million as compared to 15.8 million in the prior year period. 

Bookings
 in 2024 included a 10.0 million multisystem order from an industrial customer that will be used to deposit a silicon carbide protective
 coating on OEM components. 

Bookings
 in 2023 included 8.7 million of multiple systems orders from an aerospace customer and a battery nanomaterial production system
 of 1.8 million. 

During
 the first quarter of 2024, we received an order from an additional customer for our new PVT200 system that will be used to grow silicon
 carbide crystals for the manufacture of 200 mm wafers. This unit was shipped to the customer in the third quarter of 2024. 

Our
 backlog increased from 18.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 19.8 million at September 30, 2024. 

Cash
 balance at September 30, 2024 was 10.0 million as compared to 14.0 million at December 31, 2023 

Business
Update 

Our
core strategy is to focus on growth end markets in applications related to aerospace, the electrification of everything, 
and industrial applications. With respect to aerospace, our systems are being used by our customers to produce ceramic matrix composite
materials CMCs that will be used in next generation gas turbine jet engines with the objective of reducing jet fuel consumption
and to produce specialty coatings for advanced high temperature environments. 

22 

The
phrase electrification of everything refers to the shift from fossil fuels to the use of electricity to power devices,
buildings, electric vehicles EVs ), and many other applications. 

Our
current strategy yielded multisystem orders of PVT150 equipment in 2023 and 2022 that were delivered to one company that manufactures
silicon carbide wafers. Although we continue to invest in our vision for the electrification of everything, we have observed
lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates which may reduce demand for silicon carbide and impact sales of our
PVT systems. In addition, the recent global over capacity of 150 mm silicon carbide wafers has reduced the market for 150 mm silicon
carbide growth systems. 

In
February 2024, we received an order from an additional customer for our new PVT200 system used to grow silicon carbide crystals for the
manufacture of 200 mm wafers. This represents our second customer for our PVT equipment. This customer plans to evaluate our equipment
for potential additional purchases of PVT equipment. We shipped this unit to the customer in the third quarter of 2024. 

We
have also received orders from OneD Battery Materials in 2023, a company that is engaged in providing battery nanomaterials. 

Both
technologies are essential for the support of the EV market. These systems should provide us with standard product offerings to continue
to support the EV focused market as well as energy storage, power conversion and power transmission. We plan to evaluate opportunities
to expand our product offerings in the power electronics market to build off the introduction of the PVT150 and PVT200 systems. We are
also evaluating our ability to provide other equipment used in the manufacturing process of silicon carbide wafers. 

During
2022, we also received an order from an aerospace company for a production chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) system that will be used
to manufacture CMCs for gas turbine jet engines. In 2023, we received an order from the same aerospace company for an additional three
CVI systems and in November 2024 we received an order for an additional CVI system. 

In
February 2024, we received a multisystem order from an industrial customer for approximately 10.0 million that will be used for depositing
a silicon carbide protective coating on OEM components. 

We
have generally gained new customers through our industry reputation, as well as print advertising and trade show attendance. We have
increased the number of trade shows and industry conferences we attend. 

Historically,
our orders have fluctuated based on end user market conditions, adoption of our new products and acceptance of our products. The order
rate as well as other factors in our manufacturing process ultimately impacts the timing of revenue recognition, whether accounted for
over time or at a point in time. Accordingly, orders received from customers and the corresponding revenue recognized may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter. The sales cycle for our equipment is typically six months, but can range up to twelve to eighteen months, depending
on the application and product stage of the equipment. The order cycle to manufacture and test a system also will vary from six to eighteen
months for our CVD Equipment segment and two to twelve months for our SDC segment, depending on system complexity and magnitude of the
system.

Revenue 

Our
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.2 million compared to 6.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 31.4 . 

The
increase in revenue versus the prior year period was primarily attributable to higher revenue of 0.9 million from our CVD Equipment
segment, a 0.4 million increase in revenue from our SDC segment, and a 0.6 million increase from our CVD Materials segment.
Revenue from one aerospace customer for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented 29.1 of our total revenues and 42.0 
of CVD Equipment segment revenues. 

The
revenue contributed by the CVD Equipment segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 5.7 million represented 69.3 of overall
revenue as compared to 4.8 million or 76.3 of overall revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues
of 0.9 million or 18.5 resulted principally from increases in revenues from aerospace contracts in progress offset in part by lower
revenue for PVT150/200 systems and spare parts. 

There
were certain customer contracts in 2023 where the revenue was to be recognized at the point in time when the equipment is
transferred to the customer based on contract terms. These contracts were modified during the three months ended September 30, 2023
such that the revenue under these contracts is now being recognized over time using the input method. The Company and CVD Equipment
segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 include 0.8 million of revenue that was deferred as of June 30, 2023
and recognized on the date of the contract modification. 

The
revenue contributed by the SDC segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.0 million represented 22.6 of overall revenue
as compared to 1.6 million or 22.3 of overall revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for our SDC segment increased
by 0.4 million or 27.5 due to higher demand for gas delivery system products as compared to the prior period. 

25 

The
revenue contributed by the CVD Materials segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.6 represented 8.1 of our overall
revenue as compared to 0.1 million or 1.4 of overall revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.6 million
was due to the final sales to an aerospace company and MesoScribe ceased operations as of September 30, 2024. 

Our
order backlog at September 30, 2024 was approximately 19.8 million as compared to December 31, 2023 of 18.4 million. Our backlog at
September 30, 2024 consists of approximately 17.0 million related to remaining performance obligations of contracts in progress and
not yet started that will be recognized over time with the balance of approximately 2.8 million representing other orders received from
customers. Historically, our revenues and orders have fluctuated based on changes in order rate as well as other factors in our manufacturing
process that impact the timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, orders received from customers and revenue recognized may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.8 million, with a gross profit margin of 22.4 , compared to a gross profit
of 1.6 million and a gross profit margin of 25.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit of 0.2
million was primarily due to higher revenues as well as improved margins on CVD contracts in progress and final MesoScribe sales that
was partially offset by a 1.0 million non-cash charge to reduce certain PVT inventory to net realizable value. 

Research
and Development 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 0.6 million, or 7.9 of revenue as compared to
 0.7 million, or 11.3 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million or 8.5 . The decrease in
2024 was due to more engineering time being charged to cost of revenue based on contracts in progress. 

General
engineering support and expenses related to the development of more standardized products and value-added development of existing products
are reflected as part of research and development expense. General engineering support and expenses are charged to costs of revenue when
work is performed directly on a customer order. 

Selling 

Selling
expenses were 0.4 million or 5.2 of the revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.4 million or 7.0 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. There were no significant changes in selling expenses as compared to the prior period quarter. 

26 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.3 million or 16.1 of revenue compared to 1.4 million
or 23.3 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in 2024 was due principally to a reduction of employee
compensation and lower professional fees as compared to the prior year quarter. 

Gain
on Sale of Equipment 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 0.6 million on the sale of equipment related to our MesoScribe subsidiary
representing the sale price of 0.8 million less the costs of the equipment sold of 0.2 million. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net was 0.1 million and 0.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income
is principally interest income on treasury bills. Interest income was lower than the prior period due to less amounts invested and lower
interest rates. 

Income
Taxes 

We
continue to evaluate the potential utilization of our deferred tax asset, which has been fully reserved for, on a quarterly basis, by
reviewing our economic models, including projections of future operating results.

Revenue 

Our
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.5 million compared to 20.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 2.7 . 

The
decrease in revenue versus the prior year period was primarily attributable to lower revenues of 1.0 million from our CVD Equipment
segment and 0.3 million from our CVD Materials segment, offset in part by a 0.6 million increase in revenue from our SDC segment. Revenue
from one aerospace customer for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented 31.2 of our total revenues and 47.7 of CVD Equipment
segment revenues. 

The
revenue contributed by the CVD Equipment segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 12.7 million represented 65.2 of overall
revenue as compared to 13.8 million or 68.4 of overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues
of 1.0 million or 7.5 resulted principally from lower PVT150 systems and revenue from spares and parts offset by increases in revenues
from aerospace contracts in progress. 

The
revenue contributed by the SDC segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.3 million represented 30.6 of overall revenue
as compared to 5.7 million or 26.1 of overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for our SDC segment increased
by 0.6 million or 10.1 due to higher demand for gas delivery system products as compared to the prior period. 

The
revenue contributed by the CVD Materials segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.8 million represented 4.0 of our
overall revenue as compared to 1.1 million or 5.5 of overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of
 0.3 million was principally due to the disposition of Tantaline in May 2023 and the wind down of MesoScribe s operations. 

29 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.3 million, with a gross profit margin of 22.1 , compared to a gross profit
of 5.4 million and a gross profit margin of 27.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit of 1.1
million was primarily the result of lower revenue and lower gross margins on CVD Equipment contracts and a 1.0 million non-cash charge
to reduce certain PVT inventory to net realizable value partially offset by improved in gross margins on SDC revenues and final MesoScribe
sales. 

Research
and Development 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 2.1 million, or 10.6 of revenue as compared to 1.9
million, or 9.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.2 million or 10.2 . The increase in 2024 was the result
of lower costs allocated to cost of revenue and a recruitment fee for engineering staff. 

General
engineering support and expenses related to the development of more standardized products and value-added development of existing products
are reflected as part of research and development expense. General engineering support and expenses are charged to costs of goods sold
when work is performed directly on a customer order. 

Selling 

Selling
expenses were 1.3 million or 6.5 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.3 million or 6.4 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no significant changes in selling expenses as compared to the prior period. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.1 million or 20.8 of revenue compared to 4.4 million
or 22.1 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.4 million. The decrease in expenses was principally
due to lower salaries of 0.1 million due to sale of Tantaline, lower bonuses and commissions of 0.1 million and lower professional
fees of 0.1 million, offset by higher stock-based compensation expense of 0.1 million. 

Gain
on Sale of Equipment 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 0.6 million on the sale of equipment related to our MesoScribe subsidiary
representing the sale price of 0.8 million less the costs of the equipment sold of 0.2 million. 

Loss
on disposition of Tantaline 

This
item represents the net loss on the sale of our Tantaline subsidiary including professional fees. 

30 

Impairment
Charge 

This
item represents the loss on the impairment of certain assets of MesoScribe based on the decision to dispose of the subsidiary. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net was 0.4 million and 0.5 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Other income is principally interest income on treasury bills. The reduction in other income, net was due to foreign exchange gain
recorded and interest income on the employee retention credit received in 2023. 

Income
Taxes 

We
continue to evaluate the potential utilization of our deferred tax asset, which has been fully reserved for, on a quarterly basis, by
reviewing our economic models, including projections of future operating results. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, aggregate working capital was 13.3 million as compared to aggregate working capital of 14.3 million at December
31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 10.0 million and 14.0 million, respectively. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.7 million. This decrease was principally due to
the net loss of 2.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 3.2 million, reduction in contract liabilities of 1.6 million offset
by a reduction in inventory of 0.6 million and non-cash items of 2.5 million including a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
of 1.0 million.. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of capital expenditures of 0.2 million related
to purchases of equipment, building improvements and software. 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of repayments of 0.1 million for an equipment
loan. 

We
believe that our cash and cash equivalent positions and our projected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working
capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months from the filing of this Form 10-Q. We will continue to assess
our operations and take actions anticipated to maintain our operating cash to support the working capital needs.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company s consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We
believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following
accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgments, estimates and assumptions and are considered critical accounting estimates. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
design, manufacture, and sell custom chemical vapor deposition equipment through contractual agreements. These system sales require us
to deliver functioning equipment that is generally completed within two to eighteen months from commencement of order acceptance. We
recognize revenue over time by using an input method based on costs incurred as it depicts our progress toward satisfaction of the performance
obligation. Under this method, revenue arising from fixed price contracts is recognized as work is performed based on the ratio of costs
incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations. 

Incurred
costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies,
tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Contract material costs are included in incurred costs when the project materials have been purchased
or moved to work-in-process as required by the project s engineering design. Cost based input methods of revenue recognition require
us to make estimates of costs to complete the projects. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions
related to the costs to complete the projects, including materials, labor, and other system costs. If the estimated total costs on any
contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known and
can be reasonably estimated. 

32 

There
exist many inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues, expenses and progress toward completion, particularly on larger or
longer-term contracts. Changes in estimates of the total sales, related costs, and progress toward completion on such contracts may significantly
impact the estimated gross margins, or losses may need to be recognized in future periods. Any such resulting changes in margins or contract
losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. 

Inventory
Valuation 

Inventories
(raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods) are valued at the lower of cost (determined on the first-in, first-out method) or
net realizable value. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirement is written down to
its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. The Company evaluates usage requirements by analyzing historical usage, anticipated
demand, alternative uses of materials, and other qualitative factors. Unanticipated changes in demand for the Company s products
may require a write down of inventory, which would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. Any such charge
could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. 

Long-Lived
Assets 

Long-lived
assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances arise, an estimate of the future undiscounted
cash flows produced by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine
if impairment exists pursuant to the requirements of ASC 360-10-35, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. If the
asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured on the excess of it carrying value over its fair value. Assets to
be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or net realizable value. In the future, if we determine that our long-lived
assets are impaired, we would be required to recognize a charge in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such
charge could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedure s 

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 13d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, (the Exchange Act )). As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, under the direction
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report ). 

Based
on that review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, along with others in our management, have determined
that as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
internal controls over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

We
believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the
control systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within a company have been detected.
