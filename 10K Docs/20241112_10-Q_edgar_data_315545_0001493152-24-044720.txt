NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information pursuant to Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be reviewed in
conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 

at September 30, 2024 which includes of restricted cash resulting from
a grant received from the State of Tennessee. The Company s working capital deficit was and as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and ,
respectively, and cash used in operations was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company continues to incur significant operating losses. Management expects that significant on-going operating expenditures will
be necessary to successfully implement the Company s business plan and develop and market its products. These circumstances raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Implementation of the Company s plans and its ability to continue as a
going concern will depend upon the Company s ability to develop PV-10, PH-10, and/or any other HX-based drug products, and to raise
additional capital. 

The
Company plans to access capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, including additional convertible debt
issuance pursuant to the 2024 Financing (see Note 5 and Note 13), exchange offers, debt financings, corporate collaborations, or
other means. In addition, the Company continues to explore opportunities to strategically monetize its lead drug candidates, PV-10
and PH-10, through potential co-development and licensing transactions, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be
successful with such plans. The Company has historically been able to raise capital through equity offerings, although there can be
no assurance that it will continue to be successful in the future. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital, it will not
be able to pay its obligations as they become due. 

The
primary business objective of management is to build the Company into a commercial-stage biotechnology company; however, there can be
no assurance that it will be successful in co-developing, licensing, and/or commercializing PV-10, PH-10, and/or any other HX-based drug
candidate developed by the Company or entering into any financial transaction. Moreover, even if the Company is successful in improving
its current cash flow position, the Company nonetheless plans to seek additional funds to meet its long-term requirements in 2024 and
beyond. The Company anticipates that these funds will otherwise come from the proceeds of private placement transactions, the exercise
of existing warrants and outstanding stock options, or public offerings of debt or equity securities. While the Company believes that
it has a reasonable basis for its expectation that it will be able to raise additional funds, there can be no assurance that it will
be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, or complete additional financing in a timely manner. Any such financing may
result in significant dilution to stockholders. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate our continuation
as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement
values.

See Note 10, Grants. 

,
although the Company seeks to minimize this through treasury management. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these
balances although there can be no assurance that it will not experience any losses in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company had cash and restricted cash balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits of and , respectively.

19 

Business
Strategy 

The
Company is selectively continuing ongoing and planning to initiate new monotherapy and combination therapy ITU PV-10 clinical trials
in melanoma and liver cancer indications to generate more and/or new clinical data and appropriately utilizing clinical data from historical
ITU PV-10 trials, EAPs, and/or QOL study of these oncology indications. Our goals are to pursue drug approval pathways and/or co-development
relationships with commercial pharmaceutical companies for ITU PV-10 based on these indications and data. 

The
Company is developing a systemically administered formulation of pharmaceutical-grade RBS for the treatment of cancer. Our goals, when
this work is complete, are to file an investigational new drug application IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), take an initial systemic drug candidate into an early-stage clinic trial for an initial oncology or hematology indication,
and/or pursue a co-development collaboration or out-license arrangement for this route of administration and disease area. 

The
Company is developing different formulations of pharmaceutical-grade RBS using different concentrations and different routes of administration
for other disease areas by endeavoring to show non-clinical activity and lack of toxicity. Our goals, when each task of this work is
completed, are to file an IND with the FDA, take an initial drug candidate into an early-stage clinic trial for an initial indication,
and/or pursue a co-development collaboration or out-license arrangement for the respective disease area and route of administration. 

The
Company is endeavoring to fully elucidate the traits and characteristics of the RBS molecule using different academic medical centers
under sponsored research and testing agreements. Our goal is to gain and communicate additional knowledge of the RBS molecule s
targeting, mechanism, signaling, immune response, and other features that are common to and/or different from each disease area and indication
under research. 

The
Company is doing rigorous chemical analytical comparisons of non-pharmaceutical grades of rose bengal from specialty chemical suppliers
against the Company s pharmaceutical-grade RBS. Our goal is to demonstrate the proprietary nature of the Company s pharmaceutical-grade
RBS and that our pharmaceutical-grade RBS meets the necessary uniformity and purity requirements for commercial pharmaceutical use. 

20 

RBS
API and Drug Candidate Manufacturing 

Our
pharmaceutical-grade RBS resulted from the Company s innovation of a proprietary, patented, commercial-scale process to synthesize
and utilize the RBS molecule into a viable active pharmaceutical ingredient API for commercial pharmaceutical use; the
development of unique chemistry, manufacturing, and control CMC specifications for API and drug candidate manufacturing
processes; the production and multi-year stability testing of multiple API and drug candidate lots; the comprehensive documentation of
lot composition and reproducibility; and the review and acceptance of CMC data from these lots by seven different national drug regulatory
agencies for use in a prior, multi-country, multi-center Phase 3 randomized control trial of the Company. 

The
Company s API and drug candidate manufacturing processes employ Quality-by-Design principles, current good manufacturing practice cGMP regulations, and the guidelines of The International Council for Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. These processes utilize controls that eliminate the formation of historical impurities and avoid the introduction
of potentially hazardous impurities that the Company believes may have been and could be present in uncontrolled and unreported amounts
in non-pharmaceutical grades of rose bengal. 

The
Company s processes of synthesizing the RBS molecule into pharmaceutical-grade RBS and manufacturing RBS API and ITU PV-10 drug
candidate, the processes CMC specifications, and the CMC data from the production of stability lots of API and drug candidate
have been reviewed by multiple national drug regulatory agencies prior to granting clinical trial authorizations for the Company to commence
a historical Phase 3 study of ITU PV-10 for the treatment of the Company s former lead indication of locally advanced cutaneous
melanoma, including the U.S. FDA, Germany s Bundesinstitut f r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM), Australia s
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) under a clinical trial notification, France s Agence Nationale de S curit 
du M dicament et des Produits de Sant (ANSM), Italy s Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), Mexico s Comisi n
Federal para la Protecci n contra Riesgos Sanitarios (COFEPRIS), and Argentina s Administraci n Nacional de Medicamentos,
Alimentos y Tecnolog a M dica (ANMAT). 

RBS
Non-proprietary Name 

The
RBS name for the Company s pharmaceutical-grade API was selected by and passed the review of the World Health Organization WHO Expert Advisory Panel on the International Pharmacopoeia and Pharmaceutical Preparations after the Company applied for a non-proprietary
name in the third quarter of 2020 and reached the status of recommended International Non-proprietary Names INN ). INN
Recommended List 88, which includes the RBS name, was published with the No. 3 issue of the WHO Drug Information, Volume 36 in the fourth
quarter of 2022. 

21 

Non-Pharmaceutical
Grades of Rose Bengal 

Commercial
Grade 

Commercial
grade rose bengal can be purchased from specialty chemical suppliers in the U.S. and in other parts of the world that manufacture it
under non-cGMP conditions. Commercial grade rose bengal appears to have reported purities that may vary between 80 and 95 and may contain
substantial amounts of unreported impurities and/or gross contaminants. Commercial grade rose bengal is typically used by researchers
unaffiliated with the Company for non-clinical study of the rose bengal molecule for potential biomedical therapeutic applications. 

We
believe that commercial grade rose bengal is still manufactured using the original historical process, or a variant thereof, developed
by the molecule s original Swiss creator Rudolph Gnehm in 1881. Some chemical manufacturers may, however, apply purification techniques
that the Company believes still result in commercial grade rose bengal possessing questionable purity and contaminants and substantial
lot-to-lot manufacturing variability. 

Diagnostic
Grade 

Diagnostic
grade rose bengal describes non-approved rose bengal that is used as an ingredient in historical or current ophthalmic solutions, strips,
and devices, has been historically or is presently compounded by pharmacists for ophthalmic use, and has been or is in other non-ophthalmic
diagnostic tests such as the rose bengal test for human brucellosis. 

We
presume, but have not yet confirmed, that diagnostic grade rose bengal is derived from commercial grade rose bengal that may have undergone
a form of purification under cGMP regulations and/or may have been compounded by a pharmacist, academic medical researcher, or commercial
entity under cGMP regulations. Here too, the Company believes that purification may not sufficiently improve the amounts and accuracy
of diagnostic grade rose bengal purity and lot contents and may not adequately reduce or eliminate lot-to-lot manufacturing variability. 

Chemical
Analytical Comparison 

In
the first quarter of 2022, the Company began work with a U.S. contract development and manufacturing organization to assess rigorously
and methodically three lots of commercial grade rose bengal, one each from three different specialty chemical suppliers, and compare
these non-pharmaceutical grade materials with the Company s pharmaceutical-grade RBS. This chemical analytical work was substantially
completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022. The Company believes that the preliminary results of these analyses indicate that
all three lots of commercial grade rose bengal had rose bengal purity that was drastically different from what was represented on their
respective certificates of analysis CofAs ), and that one of the three lots contained gross contaminants that were not
represented on its CofA. 

Potential
Barriers to Entry 

The
Company believes that the Company s proprietary, patented, pharmaceutical-grade RBS possesses several competitive advantages over
non-pharmaceutical-grade rose bengal (i.e., commercial and diagnostic grades) that researchers, clinicians, and academic, business, and/or
governmental competitors have used, are using, and/or may attempt to use for potential biomedical applications. The Company believes
that non-pharmaceutical-grade rose bengal may suffer from the uncontrolled presence of substance-related impurities and/or gross contaminants,
substantial lot-to-lot manufacturing variability, inaccurately reported and/or misrepresented purity and contents, and the lack of reproducible,
consistent, and fulsome CMC specifications and documentation. The Company believes that historical and potentially hazardous impurities
and other manufacturing and handling issues facing non-pharmaceutical grade rose bengal may pose significant scientific, technological,
and economic challenges to overcome and validate for compliance with modern drug regulatory standards.

Components
of Operating Results 

Grant
Revenue 

Grant
revenue is recognized when qualifying costs are incurred and there is reasonable assurance that the conditions of the grant have been
met. Cash received from grants in advance of incurring qualifying costs is recorded as unearned grant revenue and recognized as grant
revenue when qualifying costs are incurred. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

A
large component of our total operating expenses is the Company s investment in research and development activities, including the
clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research and undertake
clinical trials to develop our drug candidates. These expenses consist primarily of: 

Costs
 of conducting clinical trials, including amounts paid to clinical centers, clinical research organizations and consultants, among
 others; 

Salaries
 and related expenses for personnel, including stock-based compensation expense; 

Other
 outside service costs including cost of contract manufacturing; 

The
 costs of supplies and reagents; and, 

Occupancy
 and depreciation charges. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future
as we advance our existing product candidates through clinical trials and pursue their regulatory approval. Undertaking clinical development
and pursuing regulatory approval are both costly and time-consuming activities. As a result of known and unknown uncertainties, we are
unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development activities, or if, when, and to what extent we
will generate revenue from any subsequent commercialization and sale of our drug candidates. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in
executive, finance, accounting, business development, legal, information technology and corporate communication functions. Other costs
include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense, insurance, and professional fees for legal, patent
and accounting services.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 651,486 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 218,397 or 50.4 compared to
 433,089 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) increased payroll and taxes for the addition
of two new officers, and (ii) increased legal fees related to patents, partially offset by (iii) lower directors fees and professional
fees due to the resignation of Mr. Horowitz, our former COO.

officer s resignation, (iii) higher payroll and taxes due to addition of two new officers, and (iv) higher other general and administrative
costs due to a refund received in 2023 for employee retention.

expense increased by 19,162 or 12.2 from 157,589 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 176,751 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the interest expense costs incurred in connection with the higher average
note payables balances. 

Research
and development tax credit in Australia decreased by 6,441 or 40.8 from 15,798 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9,357
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to no active clinical trials currently in Australia. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s cash and restricted cash were 614,189 at September 30, 2024 which includes 426,732 of restricted cash resulting from
a grant received from the State of Tennessee, compared to 1,026,799 at December 31, 2023, which included 950,223 of restricted cash.
The Company s working capital deficit was 5,464,760 and 7,652,098 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
We have continuing net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of 255,055,650
as of September 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period within
one year from the date that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. The condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a basis that
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we
be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional financing
as may be required to fund current operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, cash required for our current liabilities included approximately 2,977,080 for accounts payable and other accrued
expenses (including operating lease liabilities) and a 110,544 note payable related to our short-term financing of our commercial insurance
policies. Also, if not converted prior to maturity, convertible debt in the amount of 2,653,000 plus accrued interest will mature one
year from the date of the notes. The Company intends to meet these cash requirements from its current cash balance and from future financing. 

Management s
plans include selling our equity securities and obtaining other financing, including the issuance of 2024 unsecured convertible notes
(the 2024 Financing ), to fund our capital requirements and on-going operations; however, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful in these efforts. Significant funds will be needed to continue and complete our ongoing and planned clinical
trials. 

27 

Access
to Capital 

Management
plans to access capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, including the 2024 Financing, equity financings,
debt financings, corporate collaborations, or other means. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will not be able to pay our
obligations as they become due. 

The
primary business objective of management is to build the Company into a commercial-stage biotechnology company; however, there can be
no assurance that management will be successful in implementing the Company s business plan of developing, licensing, and/or commercializing
our prescription drug candidates. Moreover, even if we are successful in improving our current cash flow position, we nonetheless plan
to seek additional funds to meet our current and long-term requirements in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate that these funds will otherwise
come from the proceeds of private placement transactions, the exercise of outstanding stock options, or public offerings of debt or equity
securities. While we believe that we have a reasonable basis for our expectation that we will be able to raise additional funds, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on commercially acceptable terms, or complete additional financing in a timely
manner. In addition, any such financing may result in significant dilution to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require our management to make estimates
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates,
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences
between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates
on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations
for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are
not deemed critical, as defined above. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also
known as special purpose entities SPEs ).

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Even
assuming the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error
or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system s objectives will be met. In general, our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
our control system s objective will be met, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Company believes that such transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the
 Securities Act ), in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder)
