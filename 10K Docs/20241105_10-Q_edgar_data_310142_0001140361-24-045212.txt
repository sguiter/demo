MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management s current assumptions and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, and financial results. Forward-looking statements include
 statements in the future tense, statements referring to any period after September 30, 2024, and statements including the terms expect, believe, anticipate, and other similar terms that express expectations as to future events or conditions.
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other
 factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. A variety of factors could cause the Company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results.
 These factors and assumptions include, among others, the Company s ability to manage general business, economic, and capital market conditions, including actions taken by customers in response to such market conditions, and the impact of recessions
 and economic downturns; the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, including inflation and shortages impacting the availability and cost of raw materials, energy, and other supplies, disruptions and delays in the Company s supply
 chain, and the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and other parties in the Middle East; the availability and cost of labor, logistics, and transportation; the pace and nature of new product introductions by the Company and
 the Company s customers; the Company s ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and changing technologies; the Company s ability to successfully implement its growth strategies; the outcome of the Company s various
 productivity-improvement and cost-reduction efforts, acquisition and divestiture activities, and Portfolio Optimization Plan; industry, regulatory, legal, and economic factors related to the Company s domestic and international business; the
 effects of tariffs, trade barriers, and disputes; growth in markets for products in which the Company competes; industry and customer acceptance of price increases; actions by competitors; the Company s ability to enhance its innovation efforts and
 drive cost efficiencies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and the matters discussed under Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company
 does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

OVERVIEW

Revenue

Revenue was 392.6 million and 363.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue was 1.2 billion and 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in
 revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher volumes and selling prices. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of foreign exchange rates decreased consolidated revenue by
 approximately 1 . Foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Gross Margin

The Company s gross margin was 33.2 and 31.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s gross margin was 32.8 and 32.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
 in gross margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the higher volumes and selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 20.3 and 19.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 20.2 and 19.3 for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling and administrative expenses were increased by Portfolio Optimization Plan costs totaling 1.0 million, which increased selling and
 administrative expenses as a percent of revenue by approximately 20 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling and administrative expenses were increased by Portfolio Optimization Plan costs totaling 5.3 million, which
 increased selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue by approximately 50 basis points. See Portfolio Optimization Plan below for further information. The remaining increase in selling and
 administrative expense as a percent of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to higher performance-based executive compensation costs in 2024.

14 

Index 

Operating Income

Operating income was 50.5 million and 44.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating margins were 12.9 and 12.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
 in operating margin was primarily due to the higher volumes and selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher performance-based executive compensation costs in 2024. Portfolio Optimization Plan costs also offset the
 increase, decreasing operating margins by approximately 30 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Operating income was 149.6 million and 147.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating margins were 12.7 and 13.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Portfolio
 Optimization Plan costs decreased operating margins by approximately 50 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was 7.7 million and 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 22.4 million and 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in
 interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 23.7 and 17.5 , respectively. The effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 25.7 and 22.7 , respectively.
 The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by changes in estimates associated with the finalization of prior year foreign tax items and the mix of foreign earnings. The effective tax rates
 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were also impacted by the limited tax deductibility of costs related to the Portfolio Optimization Plan. The effective tax rates for both the three and nine months ended September 30,
 2023, were also impacted by changes in valuation allowances.

Portfolio Optimization Plan

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to undertake an effort to optimize certain production facilities and improve efficiencies within the Company (Portfolio
 Optimization Plan). As part of the Portfolio Optimization Plan, in the Flavors Extracts segment, the Company evaluated the closure of its manufacturing facility in Felinfach, Wales, United Kingdom, the closure of its sales office in Granada,
 Spain, and the centralization and elimination of certain selling and administrative positions. In addition, in the Color segment, the Company evaluated the closure of a manufacturing facility in Delta, British Columbia, Canada, the closure of a
 sales office in Argentina, and centralizing and eliminating certain production positions and selling and administrative positions. The Company reports all costs associated with the Portfolio Optimization Plan in the Corporate Other segment.

T he Company s Felinfach site will continue to operate until all production activities have successfully transferred to other locations, and then will be closed. The Company has substantially completed
 all other actions contemplated under the Portfolio Optimization Plan in accordance with local laws. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred costs of 1.2 million related to the Portfolio Optimization Plan recorded in Corporate Other, primarily for costs associated with employee separation and professional
 services.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred costs of 5.8 million related to the Portfolio Optimization Plan recorded in Corporate Other, primarily for costs associated with employee separation, impairment of fixed
 assets, decommissioning, and professional services.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Within the following tables, the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (1) adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude restructuring and other costs,
 including the Portfolio Optimization Plan costs, and (2) percentage changes in revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted local currency basis, which eliminate the effects that result from translating its international
 operations into U.S. dollars and restructuring and other costs, including the Portfolio Optimization Plan costs.

15 

Index 

The Company has included each of these non-GAAP measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented
 in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. Rather, they should be considered together with GAAP measures and the rest of the
 information included in this report. Management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis and to gain additional insight into underlying operating and performance trends, and
 the Company believes the information can be beneficial to investors for the same purposes. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition

The Company s financial position remains strong. The Company is in compliance with its loan covenants calculated in accordance with applicable agreements as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects its cash flow from operations and its
 existing debt capacity can be used to meet anticipated future cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and dividend payments, as well as potential acquisitions and stock repurchases. The Company s contractual obligations consist
 primarily of operational commitments, which we expect to continue to be able to satisfy through cash generated from operations and debt. The Company has various series of notes outstanding that mature from 2025 through 2029. The Company believes
 that it has the ability to refinance or repay these obligations through a combination of cash flow from operations, issuance of additional notes, and sufficient borrowing capacity under the Company s revolving credit facility, which matures in
 2026.

18 

Index 

As a result of our ability to manage the impact of inflation through pricing and other actions, the impact of inflation was not material to the Company s financial position and its results of operations for the three or nine months ended
 September 30, 2024. The Company has experienced increased costs for certain inputs, such as raw materials, shipping and logistics, and labor-related costs. We continue to expect to manage these impacts in the near term, but persistent, accelerated,
 or expanded inflationary conditions could exacerbate these challenges and impact our profitability.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was 135.8 million and 106.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash used
 for performance-based compensation payments (which are determined based on prior year performance) made during 2024 compared to 2023 and an increase in cash provided by inventory during 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by a decrease in cash
 provided by accounts receivable.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was 37.2 million and 65.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures were 36.1 million and 67.7 million during the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was 75.1 million and 36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net debt decreased by 19.8 million and increased by 23.5 million for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For purposes of the cash flow statement, net changes in debt exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Dividends of 52.0 million and 51.9 million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023, respectively. Total dividends of 1.23 per share were paid for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
