Overview 
 Lithia and Driveway (NYSE: LAD) is one of the largest global automotive retailers providing an array of products and services throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle. Simple, convenient and transparent experiences are offered through our comprehensive network of physical locations, e-commerce platforms, captive finance solutions, fleet management offerings, and other synergistic adjacencies. We have delivered consistent profitable growth in a massive and unconsolidated industry. Our highly diversified and competitively differentiated design provides us the flexibility and scale to pursue our vision to modernize personal transportation solutions wherever, whenever and however consumers desire. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 467 locations representing 52 brands in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. 
 
 We offer a wide array of products and services fulfilling the entire vehicle ownership lifecycle including new and used vehicles, financing and insurance products and automotive repair and maintenance aftersales. We strive for diversification in our products, services, brands and geographic locations to reduce dependence on any one manufacturer, reduce susceptibility to changing consumer preferences, manage market risk and maintain profitability. Our diversification, along with our operating structure, provides a resilient and nimble business model.

Table of Contents 

We seek to provide customers with a seamless, blended online and physical retail experience, broad selection and access to specialized expertise and knowledge. Our comprehensive network enables us to provide convenient touch points for customers and provides services throughout the vehicle life cycle. We seek to increase market share and optimize profitability by focusing on the consumer experience and applying proprietary performance measurement systems fueled by data science. Our Driveway and GreenCars brands complement our in-store experiences in the U.S. and provide convenient, simple and transparent platforms that serve as our e-commerce home solutions and allow us to deliver differentiated, proprietary digital experiences. Enhancing our business, our captive auto financing division allows us to provide financing solutions for customers and diversify our business model with adjacent products. 
 
 Our long-term strategy to create value for our customers, employees and shareholders includes the following elements: 
 
 Driving operational excellence, innovation and diversification 
 LAD builds magnetic brand loyalty in our 467 stores and with Driveway, our e-commerce home delivery experience, and GreenCars, our electric vehicle learning resource and marketplace. Operational excellence is achieved by focusing the business on convenient and transparent consumer experiences supported by proprietary data science to improve market share, consumer loyalty, and profitability. By promoting an entrepreneurial model with our in-store experiences, we build strong businesses responsive to each of our local markets. Utilizing performance-based action plans, we develop high-performing teams and foster manufacturer relationships. 
 
 In response to evolving consumer preferences, we invest in modernization that supports and expands our core business. These digital strategies combine our experienced, knowledgeable workforce with our owned inventory and physical network of stores, enabling us to be agile and adapt to consumer preferences and market specific conditions. Additionally, we systematically explore transformative adjacencies, which are identified to be synergistic and complementary to our existing business, such as our captive auto finance division and our fleet funding and management division. 
 
 Our investments in modernization are well under way and are taking hold with our teams as they provide digital shopping experiences including finance, contactless test drives and home delivery or curbside pickup for vehicle purchases. Our people and these solutions power our national brands, overlaying our physical footprint in a way that we believe attracts a larger population of digital consumers seeking transparent, empowered, flexible and simple buying and servicing experiences. 
 
 Our performance-based culture is geared toward an incentive-based compensation structure for a majority of our personnel. We develop pay plans that are measured based upon various factors such as customer satisfaction, profitability and individual performance metrics. These plans serve to reward team members for creating customer loyalty, achieving store potential, developing high-performing talent, meeting and exceeding manufacturer requirements and living our core values. 
 
 We have centralized many administrative functions to drive efficiencies and streamline store-level operations. The reduction of administrative functions at our stores allows our local managers to focus on customer-facing opportunities to increase revenues and gross profit. Our operations are supported by regional and corporate management, as well as dedicated training and personnel development programs which allow us to share best practices across our network and develop management talent. 
 
 Growth through acquisition and network optimization 
 Our acquisition growth strategy has been successful both financially and culturally. Our disciplined approach focuses on acquiring new vehicle franchises, which operate in markets ranging from mid-sized regional markets to metropolitan markets. Acquisition of these businesses increases our proximity to consumers throughout North America and the U.K. While we target annual after tax return of more than 15 for our acquisitions, we have averaged over a 25 return by the third year of ownership due to a disciplined approach focusing on accretive, cash flow positive targets at reasonable valuations. In addition to being financially accretive, acquisitions aim to drive network growth that improves our ability to serve customers through vast selection, greater density and access to customers and ability to leverage national branding and advertising. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 As we focus on expanding our physical network of stores, one of the criteria we evaluate is a valuation multiple between 3x to 6x of investment in intangibles to estimated annualized adjusted EBITDA, with various factors including location, ability to expand our network and talent considered in determining value. We also target an investment in intangibles as a percentage of annualized revenues in the range of 15 to 30 . 
 
 We regularly optimize and balance our network through strategic divestitures to ensure continued high performance. We believe our disciplined approach provides us with attractive acquisition opportunities and expanded coast-to-coast coverage. 
 
 Thoughtful capital allocation 
 We manage our liquidity and available cash to support our long-term plan focused on growth through acquisitions and investments in our existing business, technology and adjacencies that expand and diversify our business model. In the current market of elevated acquisition pricing, we have adjusted our free cash flow deployment strategy. Under current conditions, including recent trends in our stock price, we may consider repurchases as a more attractive use of funds than acquisitions. Our current free cash flow deployment strategy has shifted to an allocation of 50 to 60 investment in acquisitions, 25 investment in capital expenditures, innovation, and diversification and 15 to 25 in shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the first nine months of 2024, we utilized 271.9 million for capital expenditures investing in our existing business and paid 42.4 million in dividends and 273.2 million in share repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, we had available liquidity of approximately 1.1 billion, which was comprised of 209.8 million in unrestricted cash, 53.9 million in marketable securities, and 863.2 million availability on our credit facilities. In addition, our unfinanced real estate could provide additional liquidity of approximately 353.0 million.

 Financial Performance 
 
 We experienced growth of revenue in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by increases in volume related to acquisitions. Total gross profit grew in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by acquisition growth and supported by same store increases in aftersales. New and used vehicle retail gross profit declined compared to 2023 due to continued normalization of margins. Net income decline was primarily driven by this margin normalization, increased interest expense, and increased SG A as a percentage of gross profit.

 Same Store Operating Data 
 We believe that same store comparisons are an important indicator of our financial performance. Same store measures demonstrate our ability to grow revenues in our existing locations. As a result, same store measures have been integrated into the discussion below. 
 
 Same store measures reflect results for stores that were operating in each comparison period and only include the months when operations occurred in both periods. For example, a store acquired in August 2023 would be included in same store operating data beginning in September 2024, after its first complete comparable month of operation. The third quarter operating results for the same store comparisons would include results for that store in only the month of September for both comparable periods.

New Retail Vehicles 
 We believe that our new vehicle retail sales create incremental profit opportunities through certain manufacturer incentive programs, arranging of third-party financing, vehicle service and insurance contracts, future resale of used vehicles acquired through trade-in, and aftersales. Our leaders in each market continue to adapt to changing conditions, respond to customer needs and manage inventory availability and selection.

Total same store new vehicle retail gross profit per unit, which includes the finance and insurance revenue generated from the sales of new retail vehicles, decreased 1,375 to 5,565. 

Used Retail Vehicles 
 Used vehicle retail sales are a strategic focus for organic growth. We offer three categories of used vehicles: manufacturer certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles; core vehicles, or late-model vehicles with lower mileage; and value autos, or vehicles with over 80,000 miles. We continue to focus on procuring vehicles across the full spectrum of the addressable used vehicle market to provide customers with a wide selection meeting all levels of affordability, driving increased used vehicle unit volumes. Our used vehicle operations provide an opportunity to generate sales to customers unable or unwilling to purchase a new vehicle, sell brands other than the store s new vehicle franchise(s) and increase sales from finance and insurance and aftersales. 

Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023 
 Used vehicle revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.5 compared to the same period of 2023 driven by acquisition activity. On a same store basis, used vehicle revenue decreased 14.6 due to a decrease in unit volume of 9.6 and a decrease in average selling prices of 5.6 .

Total same store used vehicle retail gross profit per unit, which includes the finance and insurance revenue generated from the sales of used retail vehicles, decreased 244 to 3,929. 

Finance and Insurance 
 We believe that arranging vehicle financing is an important part of our ability to sell vehicles, and we attempt to arrange financing for every vehicle we sell. We also offer related products such as extended warranties, insurance contracts and vehicle and theft protection which drive continued engagement with the consumer throughout the ownership lifecycle. 

Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023 
 Total finance and insurance income increased 3.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by acquisition activity.

 driven by a decline in service contract penetration rates. On a same store basis, our finance and insurance revenue per retail unit decreased 74 to 2,020. 

Aftersales 
 We provide automotive repair and maintenance services for customers for the new vehicle brands sold by our stores, as well as service and repairs for most other makes and models. These aftersales services are an integral part of our customer retention and the largest contributor to our overall profitability. Earnings from aftersales continue to prove to be more resilient during economic downturns, when owners tend to repair their existing vehicles rather than buy new vehicles. We believe the increased number of units in operation will continue to benefit our aftersales revenue in the coming years as more late-model vehicles age, necessitating repairs and maintenance. 

Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023 
 Our aftersales revenue increased 20.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by acquisitions, as well as an increase in customer pay and warranty revenues. 
 
 We focus on retaining customers by offering competitively-priced routine maintenance and through our marketing efforts. The largest contribution to our aftersales revenue was same store customer pay revenue of 488.4 million. 
 
 Same store aftersales gross profit increased 6.3 . This increase was primarily due to increased volumes of customer pay and warranty transactions. Overall same store aftersales gross margins increased 70 bps, primarily as a result of increased customer pay gross margin of 80 bps. 

YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 
 Our aftersales revenue increased 20.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, driven by acquisitions, as well as an increase in same store warranty and customer pay revenues. Same store customer pay revenues was the largest contribution to our aftersales revenue at 1.3 billion. 
 
 Same store aftersales gross profit increased 4.4 . This increase was primarily due to increased volumes of warranty transactions. Overall same store aftersales gross margins increased 100 bps, primarily as a result of increased warranty gross margin. Same store customer pay gross margin decreased 20 bps. 

Financing Operations 
 
 In the U.S., Financing Operations is a captive lender, originating loans only from our stores and Driveway. In Canada, Financing Operations originates loans and leases from both our Canadian stores and third-party dealerships. In the U.K., Financing Operations is related to our fleet funding and management division. These product offerings add diversity to the business model and provide an opportunity to capture additional profits, cash flows, and sales while managing our reliance on third-party finance sources. 
 
 Financing Operations income reflects the interest and fee income generated by the portfolio of auto loan and finance lease receivables, plus the lease income generated by our net investment in operating leases, less the interest expense associated with the debt utilized to fund the lending, including internal capital, a provision for estimated loan and lease losses, depreciation on vehicles leased via operating leases, and directly-related expenses.

FICO scores are not a significant factor in our proprietary credit model, which relies on information from credit bureaus and other application information. 
 4 Front-end loan-to-value represents the ratio of the amount financed to the total collateral value, which is measured as the vehicle selling price plus applicable taxes, title and fees.

 6 The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at wholesale auctions, on a trailing twelve month basis. 

Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023 
 Financing operations recorded income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss in the same period of 2023, primarily due to the increased interest income resulting from the growth of the portfolio and increase in portfolio-wide weighted average contract rate charged to customers which collectively expanded total interest margin to 4.1 , offset by increased provision expense. 
 
 Loan originations increased slightly in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, and our penetration rate decreased due to acquisition growth as we maintained underwriting standards and focused on originating loans with the highest risk-adjusted returns.

 originated in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 9.8 , compared with 10.0 in the same period of 2023, primarily due to our maintaining competitive pricing. The increase in annualized net charge-offs of past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables compared to the prior year reflects increasing financial stress on borrowers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. 

YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 
 Financing operations recorded income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss in the same period of 2023 primarily due to increased contract rates to borrowers and decreasing cost of funds, resulting in an expansion of total interest margin to 3.9 , both of which outpaced the growth in SG A and provision expense, and the addition of the U.K. Financing Operations business. 
 
 The weighted average contract rate on loans originated in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 10.0 , compared with 9.5 in the same period of 2023. The decrease in provision expense as a percentage of receivables compared to the prior year reflected the increased credit quality of the portfolio. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of receivables compared to the prior year reflected improved operational performance and economies of scale.

Floor Plan Interest Expense and Floor Plan Assistance 
 Floor plan assistance is provided by manufacturers to support store financing of vehicle inventory and is recorded as a component of vehicle gross profit when the specific vehicle is sold. However, because manufacturers provide this assistance to offset inventory carrying costs, we believe a comparison of floor plan interest expense to floor plan assistance is a useful measure of the efficiency of our vehicle sales relative to stocking levels. 
 
 Shown below are the details for carrying costs for vehicles net of floor plan assistance earned:

Income Tax Provision 
 Our effective income tax rate was as follows:

 22.8 26.5 24.4 26.4 
 1 See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for more details. 
 
 Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to last year was positively affected by a reduction in the current and deferred state tax rate due to the impact of global network expansion on worldwide combined reporting states, filing elections, and statutory rate changes. Our rate was also positively affected by an increase in general business credits and a reduction in the valuation allowance. Excluding non-core charges and acquired general business credits, we estimate our annual effective income tax rate to be 25.5 . 

Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we review any non-GAAP financial measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We believe each of the non-GAAP financial measures below improves the transparency of our disclosures, provides a meaningful presentation of our results from the core business operations because they exclude items not related to our ongoing core business operations and other non-cash items, and improves the period-to-period comparability of our results from the core business operations. We use these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures to assess our business, including our compliance with covenants in our credit facility and in communications with our Board concerning financial performance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures. 
 
 The following tables reconcile certain reported non-GAAP measures, which we refer to as adjusted, to the most comparable GAAP measure from our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We manage our liquidity and capital resources in the context of our overall business strategy, continually forecasting and managing our cash, working capital balances and capital structure in a way that we believe will meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. In the current market of elevated acquisition pricing, we have adjusted our free cash flow deployment strategy. Under current conditions, including recent trends in our stock price, we may consider repurchases as a more attractive use of funds than acquisitions. Our current free cash flow deployment strategy has shifted to allocation of 50 to 60 investment in acquisitions, 25 investment in capital expenditures, Driveway and DFC and 15 to 25 in shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities are our main sources for liquidity. In addition to the above sources of liquidity, potential sources to fund our business strategy include financing of real estate and proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We evaluate all of these options and may select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital, although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us.

 Capital Expenditures 
 Below is a summary of our capital expenditure activities in millions): 
 
 Many manufacturers provide assistance in the form of additional incentives or assistance if facilities meet specified standards and requirements. We expect that certain facility upgrades and remodels will generate additional manufacturer incentive payments. Also, tax laws allowing accelerated deductions for capital expenditures reduce the overall investment needed and encourage accelerated project timelines. 
 
 We expect to use a portion of our future capital expenditures to upgrade facilities that we recently acquired. This additional capital investment is contemplated in our initial evaluation of the investment return metrics applied to each acquisition and is usually associated with manufacturer standards and requirements. 
 
 The increase in capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023 was higher across nearly all categories, driven by higher existing operations improvements. 
 
 If we undertake a significant capital commitment in the future, we expect to pay for the commitment out of existing cash balances, construction financing and borrowings on our credit facility. Upon completion of the projects, we believe we would have the ability to secure long-term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for 70 to 90 of the amounts expended, although no assurances can be provided that these financings will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 We focus on acquiring stores at attractive purchase prices that meet our return thresholds and strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that diversify our brand and geographic mix as we continue to evaluate our portfolio to minimize exposure to any one manufacturer and achieve financial returns. 
 
 We are able to subsequently floor new vehicle inventory acquired as part of an acquisition; however, the cash generated by this transaction is recorded as borrowings on floor plan notes payable, non-trade. 
 
 Adjusted net cash paid for acquisitions, a non-GAAP measure, as well as certain other acquisition-related information is presented below: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Number of locations acquired 145 56 (in millions) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired (1,247.0) (1,204.7) Add: Borrowings on floor plan notes payable: non-trade associated with acquired new vehicle inventory 105.5 110.6 Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired adjusted (1,141.5) (1,094.1)

We evaluate potential capital investments primarily based on targeted rates of return on assets and return on our net equity investment.

We repurchased a total of 1,031,935 shares of our Common Stock at an average price of 262.82 in the first nine months of 2024, consisting of 45,903 related to tax withholding on vesting RSUs, and 986,032 related to our repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 560.9 million remaining available for repurchases and the authorizations do not have expiration dates.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. 

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 Our North American operations generally experience lower volumes in the first quarter of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns and inclement weather in certain of our markets. As a result, financial performance is expected to be lower during the first quarter than during the second, third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Our U.K. operations generally experience higher volumes in the first and third quarters of each year, due primarily to new vehicle registration practices in the U.K. We believe that interest rates, levels of consumer debt, consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives, as well as general economic conditions, also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our reported market risks or risk management policies since the filing of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024.

ARTICLE TWO LOANS Section 2.01. Loans. (a) On the terms and conditions set forth herein, including this Section and Article Four, the Borrower may from time to time on any Business Day during the Revolving Period on which no Stop-Funding Event exists, request that each Lender make an advance (the aggregate amount of such advances on a Funding Date, a Loan in the amount of each such Lender's Lender Advance, to the Borrower on a Funding Date. Any such Loan may be made by a Conduit Lender in its sole discretion, and if not made by such Conduit Lender, either (i) shall be made by the related Committed Lender, to the extent that such Loan would not cause the portion of the Loans Outstanding funded by such Lender Group, determined after giving effect to such funding, to exceed its Mandatory Commitment, or (ii) may be made by the related Committed Lender in its sole discretion, to the extent that such Loan would cause the portion of the Loans Outstanding funded by such Lender Group, determined after giving effect to such funding, to exceed its Mandatory Commitment but be less than or equal to its Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, neither any Conduit Lender nor any related Committed Lender shall have any obligation on any date to fund an amount that would cause its Lender Percentage of the Loans Outstanding, determined after giving effect to such funding, to exceed its Mandatory Commitment. 50 

(b) No later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, two Business Days prior to a proposed Funding Date, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such proposed Funding Date and Loan by delivering to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Account Bank), and the Administrative Agent shall forward to each Agent upon receipt thereof: (i) a Funding Request, which will include, among other things, the proposed Funding Date, a calculation of the Borrowing Base as of the date the Loan is requested (including all components of such calculation, including any Excess Concentration Amounts) and the Principal Amount of the Loan requested, which shall be in an amount at least equal to 1,000,000 or integral multiples of 100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, an amount equal to the Aggregate Commitment after giving effect to any payments on the related Payment Date if the Funding Date occurs on a Payment Date); and (ii) an updated Schedule of Receivables that includes each Receivable that is the subject of the proposed Loan. (c) Following receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Agents of a Funding Request, and prior to the Termination Date, each Lender Group severally agrees to make its Lender Advance of any Loan requested by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.01(b), subject to the conditions contained herein, in an aggregate amount equal to the Loan so requested. (d) In no event shall: (i) a Lender be required to fund a Principal Amount that would cause its Lender Percentage of the Loans Outstanding, determined after giving effect to such funding, to exceed its Mandatory Commitment; provided, that any Lender may elect, in its sole discretion, to fund any such Principal Amount; (ii) a Lender be required on any date to fund a Principal Amount that would cause its Lender Percentage of the Loans Outstanding, determined after giving effect to such funding, to exceed its Commitment; (iii) any Loan be requested hereunder, nor shall any Lender be obligated to fund its Lender Advance of any Loan, to the extent that after giving effect to such Loan, the Loans Outstanding would exceed the Borrowing Base; (iv) the Principal Amount of any Loan exceed the Available Amount on such day; and (v) more than one Loan be funded on any Business Day. Section 2.02. Funding Mechanics. (a) If any Funding Request is delivered to the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m., New York City time, two Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date, such Funding Request shall be deemed to be received prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the next succeeding Business Day and the proposed Funding Date of such proposed Loan shall be 51 

deemed to be the second Business Day following the date of such deemed receipt. Each Funding Request shall include a representation by the Borrower that (i) the requested Loan will not, on the related Funding Date, exceed the Available Amount and (ii) all conditions precedent to the making of such Loan have been satisfied or will be satisfied as of the proposed Funding Date. Any Funding Request shall be irrevocable. (b) Each Lender's Lender Advance of a Loan shall be made available to the Agent for its Lender Group, subject to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article Four, at or prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Funding Date, by deposit of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent's Account. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the related Agent in the event that any Lender Group either fails to make such funds available before such time or notifies the Administrative Agent that it will not make such funds available before such time. Subject to the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article Four, as determined by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Funding Date make all such funds deposited to the Administrative Agent s Account by the Agents available, in the same type of funds received, by wire transfer thereof to the Borrower's Account. If any Lender Group makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender Group as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loan set forth in Article Four are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to the related Agent for such Lender Group, without interest. (c) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided, that the Commitments of the Lender Groups are several and no Lender Group shall be responsible for any other Lender Group's failure to make Loans as required. Section 2.03. Reduction of Commitments. (a) At any time the Borrower may, upon at least five Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, each Agent, the Account Bank and each Hedge Counterparty, reduce the Facility Amount to an amount not less than the Loans Outstanding, which reduction shall be applied, unless otherwise Consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Agents, to the Commitments of each Lender pro rata based on the Lender Percentage represented by such Commitment. Any such reduction of the Commitment of any Lender shall also reduce the related Mandatory Commitment of such Lender by the same amount. If any such written notice is delivered after 3:00 p.m., New York City time, five Business Days prior, such notice shall be deemed to be received prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the next succeeding Business Day. Each partial reduction shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of 5,000,000 or integral multiples of 1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any request for a reduction in the Facility Amount shall be irrevocable and the Borrower shall deliver no more than four such requests in any 12-month period. (b) In connection with any reduction of the Facility Amount, the Borrower shall remit to the Administrative Agent and the Agents, for payment to each Lender, (i) instructions 52 

regarding such reduction and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay any Aggregate Unpaids with respect to such reduction, including any associated Breakage Costs; provided, that no such reduction shall be given effect unless the Borrower has complied with the terms of any Hedging Agreement requiring that one or more Hedge Transactions be terminated in whole or in part as a result of any such reduction in the Loans Outstanding and the Borrower has paid all Hedge Breakage Costs due to the relevant Hedge Counterparty for any such termination. Upon receipt of any such amounts, the Administrative Agent and Agents shall apply such amounts first to the pro rata reduction of the Loans Outstanding, second to the payment of the remaining Aggregate Unpaids with respect thereto, including any Breakage Costs, by paying such amounts to the Lenders pro rata, based on their respective Lender Percentages. (c) On the Commitment Termination Date for a Committed Lender, the Mandatory Commitment and the Commitment of such Committed Lender shall be automatically reduced to zero. On the Termination Date, the Mandatory Commitments and the Commitments of all Committed Lenders shall be automatically reduced to zero; provided, that if the Termination Date occurs solely due to the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event and all Lenders have consented to the waiver of such Early Amortization Event, then the Mandatory Commitments and the Commitments of all Committed Lenders shall remain at their levels immediately prior to the occurrence of such Early Amortization Event. Section 2.04. Extensions of Commitments. (a) Neither more than 120 days nor fewer than 60 days prior to any Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower may request in writing to the related Agent on behalf of its related Lender Group (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), that the related Committed Lender extend its Commitment Termination Date for an additional 364-day period as herein provided, which request will be granted or denied by each Lender Group in its sole discretion. Upon receipt of any such request, the related Agent shall notify each Committed Lender in its Lender Group. On or before the last day of the Election Period, the related Committed Lender shall notify the Agent for its Lender Group of its willingness or refusal to so extend its Commitment Termination Date; provided, that the failure of any Committed Lender to respond prior to the last day of the Election Period shall be deemed to be its refusal to so extend the Commitment Termination Date. The Agent for such Lender Group shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such willingness or refusal by the Committed Lender not later than the Business Day following the last day of the Election Period. If (i) the Committed Lender in a Lender Group has agreed to extend the related Commitment Termination Date and (ii) as of the Commitment Termination Date then in effect, no Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Commitment Termination Date then in effect for each such Committed Lender that has agreed to extend the Commitment Termination Date shall be extended to the date which is 364 days following the Commitment Termination Date then in effect or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next preceding Business Day (or to any other date as agreed upon by the Borrower and each Committed Lender). (b) Within two Business Days following the end of an Election Period, the Agent for each Lender Group shall notify each other Lender in such Lender Group, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of the identity of any Non-Extending Lender and the amount of its Commitment. The Administrative Agent and the Borrower may (but shall not be required to) 53 

request one or more other Committed Lenders to acquire all or a portion of the Commitment of the Non-Extending Lender and all amounts payable to it hereunder in accordance with Article Eleven on or prior to the related Commitment Termination Date of such Non-Extending Lender. Each Non-Extending Lender hereby agrees to assign all or a portion of its Commitment and the amounts payable to it hereunder to a replacement Committed Lender identified in accordance with the preceding sentence, subject to ratable payment of such Non-Extending Lender's Invested Percentage of the Loans Outstanding, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and a ratable portion of all fees and other amounts due to it hereunder. (c) Prior to the occurrence of the Termination Date, if a Partial Expiration Event has occurred, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and the Servicer to apply any Collections in accordance with Section 2.06(vii)(B), except as otherwise provided in Section 2.06, pro rata to the repayment of such amounts owing to any Non-Extending Lender as of the date of the related Partial Expiration Event, commencing no later than the first Payment Date which is at least two Business Days following the Commitment Termination Date for the Non-Extending Lender, specifying the amounts thereof. Section 2.05. Payments. (a) Each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum calculated in accordance with this Section 2.05. (b) Interest computed by reference to Daily Simple SOFR hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days. Interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year). In each case interest shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All interest hereunder on any Loan shall be computed on a daily basis based upon the outstanding principal amount of such Loan as of the applicable date of determination. The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) The Borrower shall pay Interest on the unpaid Principal Amount of each Loan for the period from the related Funding Date until the date that such Loan shall be paid in full. Interest shall accrue during each Interest Period and be payable on the Loans Outstanding on each Payment Date in accordance with Section 2.06. (d) The principal of and Interest on the Loans shall be paid as provided herein. In the case of Loans owned by an Agent as agent for its Lender Group, such Agent shall allocate to the members of its Lender Group each payment in respect of the Loans received by such Agent as provided herein. Payments in respect of principal and Interest (including pursuant to Section 2.13) shall be allocated and applied to Owners of such Loan based on their respective Invested Percentages, or in any such case in such other proportions as each affected Lender may agree upon in writing from time to time with such Agent and the Borrower; provided, that from and after the Commitment Termination Date for each Dissenting Lender until the earlier to occur of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the aggregate amount of payments in 54 

reduction of Loans Outstanding made after the date of the occurrence of the related Partial Expiration Event equals the Partial Expiration Event Amount, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.07, payments pursuant to Section 2.07(vi)(B) in reduction of the Partial Expiration Event Amount shall be allocated and applied to Non-Extending Lenders pro rata based on their respective Lender Percentages as of the date of the related Partial Expiration Event. (e) The interest rate on a Loan may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.17(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. (f) At or before 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to each Reporting Date, (i) each Lender shall notify the Agent for its Lender Group, and such Agents will subsequently notify the Administrative Agent, of (A) Daily Simple SOFR in effect for each day during the related Interest Period, and (B) if applicable, the date on which the Alternate Base Rate became applicable to its Invested Percentage of the Loans Outstanding or a portion thereof. At or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to each Reporting Date, the Administrative Agent shall then notify the Borrower of all such rates. For such purposes, the Agents may rely conclusively on notices from Lenders as to the interest rate or rates from time to time applicable to their respective Invested Percentage of the Loans Outstanding. Each determination by a Lender of Daily Simple SOFR pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders, each Agent, the Borrower, the Servicer, and the Collateral Custodian, in the absence of manifest error. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the other Basic Documents, if at any time the rate of interest payable by any Person under the Basic Documents exceeds the Maximum Lawful Rate, then, so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be exceeded, such rate of interest shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate. If at any time thereafter the rate of interest so payable is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, such Person 55 

shall continue to pay Interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received from such Person is equal to the total Interest that would have been received had Applicable Law not limited the interest rate so payable. In no event shall the total Interest received by a Lender under this Agreement and the other Basic Documents exceed the amount which such Lender could lawfully have received, had the Interest due been calculated from the Closing Date at the Maximum Lawful Rate. (h) The principal of and Interest on the Loans shall be paid as provided herein. In the case of Loans owned by an Agent as agent for its Lender Group, such Agent shall allocate to the members of its Lender Group each payment in respect of the Loans received by such Agent as provided herein. All payments made hereunder in respect of principal and Interest shall be allocated and applied to Owners of each Loan based on their respective Invested Percentages, or in any such case in such other proportions as each affected Lender may agree upon in writing from time to time with the related Agent and the Borrower; provided, that from and after the Commitment Termination Date for each Non-Extending Lender until the earlier to occur of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the aggregate amount of payments in reduction of Loans Outstanding made after the date of the occurrence of the related Partial Expiration Event equals the Partial Expiration Event Amount, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.06, payments pursuant to Section 2.06(vii)(B) in reduction of the Partial Expiration Event Amount shall be allocated and applied to Non-Extending Lenders pro rata based on their respective Lender Percentages as of the date of the related Partial Expiration Event. (i) At or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day of each calendar month, each Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent, for subsequent notice to the Borrower, of its Interest Rate for the related Interest Period and (B) if applicable, the date on which the Alternate Base Rate became applicable to its Invested Percentage of the Loans Outstanding or a portion thereof. For such purposes, the Agents may rely conclusively on notices from Lenders as to the interest rate or rates from time to time applicable to their respective Invested Percentage of the Loans Outstanding. Each determination by a Lender of its Interest Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders, each Agent, the Borrower, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer and the Collateral Custodian, in the absence of manifest error. (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the other Basic Documents, if at any time the rate of interest payable by any Person under the Basic Documents exceeds the Maximum Lawful Rate, then, so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be exceeded, such rate of interest shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate. If at any time thereafter the rate of interest so payable is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, such Person shall continue to pay Interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received from such Person is equal to the total Interest that would have been received had Applicable Law not limited the interest rate so payable. In no event shall the total Interest received by a Lender under this Agreement and the other Basic Documents exceed the amount which such Lender could lawfully have received, had the Interest due been calculated from the Closing Date at the Maximum Lawful Rate. Section 2.06. Settlement Procedures. On each Payment Date, the Servicer shall instruct the Account Bank to pay, to the following Persons, from the Collection Account to the extent of 56

If any Regulatory Requirement (i) subjects any Lender or Credit Provider to any charge or withholding on or with respect to any Liquidity Facility or this Agreement or a Lender or Credit Provider's obligations under a Liquidity Facility or this Agreement or on or with respect to the Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender or any Credit Provider of any amounts payable under any Liquidity Facility or this Agreement (except for changes in the rate of Tax on the overall net income of a Lender or Credit Provider, Indemnified Taxes or Excluded Taxes), (ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, fee, tax (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes), insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or liabilities of a Credit Provider or a Lender, or credit extended by a Credit Provider or a Lender pursuant to a Liquidity Facility or this Agreement or, (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a Credit Provider or a Lender of performing its obligations under a Liquidity Facility or this Agreement, or to reduce the rate of return on a Credit Provider's or Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its obligations under a Liquidity Facility or this Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by a Credit Provider or a Lender under a Liquidity Facility or this Agreement, or to require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interests or loans held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Credit Provider or Lender, such amounts charged to such Credit Provider or Lender or such amounts to otherwise compensate such Credit Provider or such Lender for such increased cost or such reduction. The term Regulatory Requirement shall mean (i) the adoption after the date hereof of any applicable law, rule or regulation (including any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity coverage) or any change therein after the date hereof, or (ii) any change after the date hereof in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency; provided, that for purposes of this definition, (A) the Dodd-Frank Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder, issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, and (B) all requests, rules, guidelines and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel II or Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a Regulatory Requirement , regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. The Borrower acknowledges that any Lender or Credit Provider may institute 61 

measures in anticipation of a Regulatory Requirement (including, without limitation, the imposition of internal charges on such Person's interests or obligations under this Agreement or any Liquidity Facility), and may commence allocating charges to or seeking compensation from the Borrower under this Section in connection with such measures, in advance of the effective date of such Regulatory Requirement (such charges or compensation, Early Adoption Increased Costs ). The Borrower agrees to pay Early Adoption Increased Costs to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of such Lender or Credit Provider, which are incurred by such Lender or Credit Provider, beginning sixty (60) days after delivery by such Lender or Credit Provider (or the Agent on its behalf) to the Borrower of a written representation and warranty (an Early Adoption Increased Costs Representation to the effect that such Lender or Credit Provider is () recognizing Early Adoption Increased Costs, (y) setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Credit Provider and (z) that such Lender or Credit Provider actually incurred such costs. The Borrower further acknowledges that any charge or compensation demanded hereunder may take the form of a monthly charge to be assessed by such Lender or Credit Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any Early Adoption Increased Costs incurred by any Lender or Credit Provider prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days after receipt by the Borrower of the Early Adoption Increased Costs Representation from or on behalf of such Lender or Credit Provider. The Early Adoption Increased Costs Representation shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (b) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Credit Provider to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Credit Provider's right to demand such compensation; provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Credit Provider pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or Credit Provider, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Requirement giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender's or Credit Provider's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Requirement giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Section 2.11. Taxes (a) Defined Term. For purposes of this Section, the term applicable law includes FATCA. (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Borrower Basic Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable 62 

under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. (c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (d) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.01(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Borrower Basic Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Borrower Basic Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). (f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (g) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Borrower Basic Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made 63 

without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.11(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is not subject to U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Borrower Basic Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN orW-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Borrower Basic Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of 64 

Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided, that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Borrower Basic Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct 65 

and withhold from such payment, if any. Solely for purposes of this clause, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or within five Business Days of its knowledge thereof notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person (i) Survival. Each party's obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Borrower Basic Document. (j) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the benefit of any Lender or Credit Provider pursuant to this Section as a result of a change of law or treaty occurring after such Lender or Credit Provider first became a party to this Agreement, such Lender or Credit Provider will, at the Borrower's request, change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if, in the sole judgment of such Lender or Credit Provider, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Credit Provider, be otherwise disadvantageous to it or inconsistent with its internal policies. Section 2.12. Take-outs. On any Business Day, the Borrower shall have the right to prepay all or a portion of the Loans Outstanding and require the Administrative Agent to release 66 

its security interest and Lien on the related Receivables, subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent (who will notify each Agent), the Servicer and the Backup Servicer at least ten Business Days' prior written notice of its intent to effect the related Take-out; (ii) unless a Take-out is to be effected on a Payment Date (in which case the relevant calculations with respect to such Take-out shall be reflected on the applicable Monthly Report), the initial Servicer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) a Take-out Date Certificate (which shall include a calculation of the Borrowing Base after giving effect to such Take-out), together with evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent that the Borrower shall have sufficient funds on the related Take-out Date to effect such Take-out in accordance with this Agreement, which funds may come from the proceeds of sales of the Receivables in connection with such Take-out and (B) a computer tape of the Receivables, both before and after giving effect to such Take-out; (iii) on the related Take-out Date, the following shall be true and correct and the Borrower shall be deemed to have certified that after giving effect to the Take-out and the release to the Borrower of the related Receivables on the related Take-out Date, (A) no Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, (B) neither an Unmatured Termination Event nor a Termination Event has occurred, nor will either result from such Take-out, (C) the fractional portion of the Eligible Pool Balance that represents the aggregate Adjusted Principal Balance of all Delinquent Receivables constituting Collateral will be no greater than 175 of the fractional portion of the Eligible Pool Balance that was represented by the aggregate Adjusted Principal Balance of all Delinquent Receivables that constituted Collateral immediately prior to the release of the related Receivables and (D) the fractional portion of the Eligible Pool Balance that represents the aggregate Adjusted Principal Balance of all Defaulted Receivables constituting Collateral will be no greater than 150 of the fractional portion of the Eligible Pool Balance that was represented by the aggregate Adjusted Principal Balance of all Defaulted Receivables that constituted Collateral immediately prior to the release of the related Receivables; (iv) on the related Take-out Date, the Servicer shall have received an amount equal to all Unreimbursed Servicer Advances associated with the Receivables to be released and the Administrative Agent shall have received, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties, as applicable, in immediately available funds, and shall then distribute to the applicable entities, an amount equal to the sum of (A) the portion of the Loans Outstanding to be prepaid, (B) an amount equal to all unpaid Interest (including Interest not yet accrued) to the extent reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be attributable to that portion of the Loans Outstanding to be paid in connection with the Take-out, (C) an aggregate amount equal to the sum of all other amounts due and owing to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties, as 67

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to exist. Section 2.16. Defaulting Committed Lenders. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Committed Lender becomes a Defaulting Committed Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Committed Lender is a Defaulting Committed Lender: (i) Unused Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Committed Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a); (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.03 hereof, the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting 72 

Committed Lender may be reduced to zero without any contemporaneous ratable reduction of the Commitments of the other Committed Lenders; (iii) neither the Commitment nor the Loans of such Defaulting Committed Lender shall be included in determining whether all Lenders, a majority of the Lenders, the Consenting Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder and the Agent of the Lender Group which includes such Defaulting Committed Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Agents have taken or may take any action hereunder (including, in each case, any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 13.01); provided, that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or Agents or each affected Lender or Agent, as applicable, which affects such Defaulting Committed Lender or the related Agent differently than other affected Lenders or Agents shall require the consent of such Defaulting Committed Lender or the related Agent, as applicable; and (iv) the Borrower may replace such Defaulting Committed Lender in accordance with Section 2.15 of this Agreement. (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent determines that a Defaulting Committed Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Committed Lender to be a Defaulting Committed Lender, then (i) the Lender Percentages shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Committed Lender's Commitment and on such date such Committed Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent and the Agents shall determine may be necessary in order for such Committed Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Lender Percentage and (ii) the provisions of clause (a), above, shall, from and after such determination, cease to be of further force or effect with respect to such Committed Lender. Section 2.17. Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 2.17, if: (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR; or (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist 73 

with respect to the relevant Benchmark, the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Basic Document (and any Hedging Agreements shall be deemed not to be a 'Basic Document' for purposes of this Section 2.17), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Basic Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Basic Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Basic Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Basic Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Basic Document. (d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.17, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Basic Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.17. (e) Upon the Borrower's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, and at all times during the continuation of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Loans will bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Basic Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of 'Interest Period' for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a 74 

tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of 'Interest Period' for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. ARTICLE THREE SECURITY Section 3.01. Collateral. (a) The parties hereto intend that this Agreement constitute a security agreement and the transactions effected hereby constitute secured loans by the Lenders to the Borrower under Applicable Law. As collateral security for the prompt, complete and indefeasible payment and performance in full when due, whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations, the Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, as agent for the Secured Parties, a lien on and security interest in all of the Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under the following, whether now existing or owned or hereafter arising or acquired by the Borrower (collectively, the Collateral ): (i) the Receivables and the related Contracts (including the right to service the Receivables in connection therewith) and any accounts or obligations evidenced thereby, any guarantee thereof, all Collections and all monies due (including any payments made under any guarantee or similar credit enhancement with respect to any such Receivables) or to become due or received by any Person in payment of any of the foregoing on or after the related Cutoff Date; (ii) the Financed Vehicles related to such Receivables (including Financed Vehicles that have been repossessed) or in any document or writing evidencing any security interest in any Financed Vehicle and each security interest in each Financed Vehicle securing each such Receivable, including all proceeds from any sale or other disposition of such Financed Vehicles; (iii) the Account Collateral; (iv) the Borrower's rights to Collections on deposit in the Lockbox Account; (v) subject to the Control Agreement, the Borrower's rights to the Collection Account and the Hedge Reserve Account; (vi) all Hedge Collateral; (vii) all Receivable Files, the Schedule of Receivables, and all documents, agreements and instruments included in the Receivable Files, including 75 

rights of recourse of the Borrower against DFC and/or any Dealer with respect to the Receivables; (viii) all Records, documents and writings evidencing or related to the Receivables or the Contracts; (ix) all rights to payment under all Insurance Policies with respect to a Financed Vehicle, including any monies collected from whatever source in connection with any default of an Obligor with respect to a Financed Vehicle and any proceeds from claims or refunds of premiums on any Insurance Policy; (x) all guaranties, indemnities, warranties, insurance (and proceeds and premium refunds thereof) and other agreements or arrangements of whatever character from time to time supporting or securing payment of the Receivables, whether pursuant to the related Contracts or otherwise; (xi) all rights to payment under all service contracts and other contracts and agreements associated with the Receivables; (xii) all security interests, Liens, guaranties and other encumbrances in favor of or assigned or transferred to the Borrower in and to the Receivables and Financed Vehicles; (xiii) all deposit accounts, monies, deposits, funds, accounts and instruments relating to the foregoing (subject to the Control Agreement); (xiv) the Purchase Agreement (including each Purchase Agreement Supplement) and remedies thereunder and the assignment to the Administrative Agent of all UCC financing statements filed by the Borrower against DFC under or in connection with the Purchase Agreement; and (xv) all income and proceeds of the foregoing. (b) The grant under this Section does not constitute and is not intended to result in a creation or an assumption by the Administrative Agent, any Agent, or any other Secured Party of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Person in connection with any or all of the Collateral or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower shall remain liable under the Contracts to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of its rights in the Collateral shall not release the Borrower from any of its duties or obligations under the Collateral and (iii) none of the Administrative Agent, any Agent, or any other Secured Party shall have any obligations or liability under the Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor shall any of the Administrative Agent, any Agent, or any other Secured Party be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. Each of DFC and the Borrower represents and warrants as to itself that each remittance of Collections by DFC or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder will have been (A) in payment of a debt incurred 76 

by the Borrower in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Lenders and the Borrower and (B) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Lenders and the Borrower. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing grant of security interest, no account, instrument, chattel paper or other obligation or property of any kind due from, owned by or belonging to a Sanctioned Person shall be Collateral. Section 3.02. Release of Collateral; No Legal Title. (a) At the same time as any Contract (i) expires by its terms or (ii) has been prepaid in full, and in each case all amounts in respect thereof have been paid by the related Obligor and subsequently deposited into a Lockbox Account or the Collection Account, the Administrative Agent will, to the extent requested by the Servicer, promptly release its interest and lien in such Contract and the related Collateral. In connection with any sale of a Financed Vehicle, after the deposit by the Servicer of the proceeds of such sale into the Lockbox Account and subsequent deposit within two Business Days thereafter into the Collection Account, the Administrative Agent will, at the sole expense of the Servicer (which, in the case of any Successor Servicer, shall be reimbursable in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06), promptly execute and deliver to the Servicer any assignments, bills of sale, termination statements and any other releases and instruments as the Servicer may reasonably request in order to effect the release and transfer of such Financed Vehicle; provided, that the Administrative Agent will not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any such Financed Vehicle in connection with such sale or transfer and assignment. Nothing in this Section shall diminish the Servicer's obligations pursuant to Section 7.03 with respect to the proceeds of any such sale. (b) Upon (i) the transfer of any Receivables and the related Collateral in connection with a Take-out or (ii) the Facility Termination Date, the Administrative Agent, at the Borrower's expense, upon payment in full of the related Aggregate Unpaids, shall execute and file such partial or full releases or partial or full assignments of financing statements and other documents and instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to effectuate the release of the relevant portion of the Collateral. Section 3.03. Protection of Security Interest; Administrative Agent, as Attorney-in-Fact. (a) The Borrower agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and take all actions, that may reasonably be necessary or desirable, or that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary, to perfect, protect, or more fully evidence the security interest granted to the Administrative Agent in the Receivables and the other Collateral, or to enable the Secured Parties to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder; provided, that prior to the declaration of a Termination Event, the Borrower shall in no case be required to relien a security interest on any Financed Vehicle in favor of the Administrative Agent or other Secured Party. (b) If the Borrower fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder after five Business Days' notice from any Secured Party, such Secured Party may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligation; and the reasonable costs and expenses of 77 

such Secured Party incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Borrower as provided in Article Nine. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent and appoints the Administrative Agent, as its attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the Borrower, (i) to execute or cause to be executed on behalf of the Borrower as debtor and to file financing statements necessary or desirable in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the interest of the Secured Parties in the Receivables and the other Collateral and (ii) to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement with respect to the Receivables and the other Collateral, as a financing statement in such offices as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion deems necessary or desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of the interests of the Secured Parties in the Receivables and the other Collateral. Such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that describes such property in any other manner as the Administrative Agent may determine, in its reasonable discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted to the Administrative Agent herein. The Borrower hereby authorizes the filing of financing statements describing the collateral as all assets of the debtor, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and wherever located, and all proceeds and products thereof or words to that effect. This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Section 3.04. Assignment of the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower hereby represents, warrants and confirms to the Administrative Agent that the Borrower has assigned to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties hereunder, all of the Borrower's right and title to and interest in the Purchase Agreement (including each Purchase Agreement Supplement). The Borrower confirms that, during the continuation of a Termination Event, the Administrative Agent shall have the sole right to enforce the Borrower's rights and remedies under the Purchase Agreement or any Purchase Agreement Supplement for the benefit of the Secured Parties, but without any obligation on the part of the Secured Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, to perform any of the obligations of the Borrower under the Purchase Agreement or any Purchase Agreement Supplement. The Borrower further confirms and agrees that such assignment to the Administrative Agent shall terminate upon the Facility Termination Date; provided, that the rights of the Secured Parties pursuant to such assignment with respect to rights and remedies in connection with any indemnities and any breach of any representation, warranty or covenants made by DFC pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, which rights and remedies survive the termination of the Purchase Agreement, shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of such assignment. Section 3.05. Waiver of Certain Laws. Each of the Borrower, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer and Collateral Custodian agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any part of the Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and each of the Borrower, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer and the Collateral Custodian, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such laws, and any and 78 

all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the Collateral as an entirety or in such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine.

(e) No Violation. The execution and delivery of the Borrower Basic Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Borrower Basic Documents and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof will not (i) conflict in any material respect with, result in any material breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under the Borrower's Formation Documents or a default in any material respect under any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower, (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the Borrower's properties (other than Permitted Liens) or (iii) violate any Applicable Law, the violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

No effective financing statement or other instrument similar in effect covering any portion of the Collateral shall at any time be on file in any recording office except such as may be filed in favor of (i) the Borrower in accordance with the Purchase Agreement or (ii) the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement.

Upon the filing of UCC-1 financing statements describing the Collateral, naming the Administrative Agent as secured party, and naming the Borrower as debtor, the Administrative Agent, as agent for the Secured Parties, shall have a first priority (except for any Permitted Liens) perfected security interest in the Collateral. All filings (including UCC filings) as are necessary in any jurisdiction to perfect the interest of the Administrative Agent, as agent for the Secured Parties, in the Collateral have been made. (m) Reports Accurate. All Monthly Reports (if prepared by the Borrower, or to the extent that information contained therein is supplied by the Borrower, such portion supplied by the Borrower), information, exhibits, financial statements, documents, books, records or reports furnished or to be furnished by the Borrower to each Agent, any Secured Party, the Backup Servicer and the Account Bank in connection with this Agreement are true, complete and correct in all material respects. (n) Location of Offices. The principal place of business and chief executive office of the Borrower and the office where the Borrower keeps all the Records are located at the address of the Borrower referred to in Section 13.02 (or at such other locations as to which the notice and other requirements specified in Section 6.02(f) shall have been satisfied) and has been so for the last four months.

Each of the Borrower and DFC is aware that in light of the circumstances described in the preceding sentence and other relevant facts, the filing of a voluntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code for the purpose of making any Receivable or any other assets of the Borrower available to satisfy claims of the creditors of DFC would not result in making such assets available to satisfy such creditors under the Bankruptcy Code.

The Borrower does not sponsor, maintain or contribute to any Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan.

No Plan Event has occurred or is 84 

reasonably expected to occur that might result, directly or indirectly, in any material lien being imposed on the property or assets of the Borrower.

(a) Beginning on the date that is thirty days after the date of the Initial Loan, the Borrower shall at all times that the Loans Outstanding are greater than zero, (i) maintain one or more Hedge Transactions in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, each of which may be in the form of an interest rate swap or an interest rate cap transaction and/or (ii) maintain amounts on deposit in the Hedge Reserve Account, in all cases to ensure that either (x) the Borrower is Fully Hedged or (y) if the Borrower is not Fully Hedged, the Hedge Reserve Account has been established and an amount not less than the Hedge Reserve Account Required Amount is on deposit therein at all times thereafter; provided, that if on any date any Mandatory Hedging Condition exists, then within two (2) Business Days of such date the Borrower must be Fully Hedged, and the Borrower must remain Fully Hedged at all times thereafter while a Mandatory Hedging Condition exists, regardless of whether any amounts are then on deposit in the Hedge Reserve Account. If at any time the Hedge Reserve Account Required Amount is greater than zero, then (A) no later than three Business Days prior to each Funding Date and no later than three Business Days prior to each Payment Date the Borrower (or the initial Servicer on behalf of the Borrower) shall obtain a quote for the purchase price of an interest rate cap that allows it to recalculate the Hedge Reserve Account Required Amount on such date and (B) beginning on the related Funding Date or Payment Date, as applicable, such quote shall be used to determine the 'Hedge Reserve Account Required Amount' until the next succeeding Funding Date or Payment Date, as applicable. It is acknowledged and agreed that any Hedge Transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.08(f) shall be deemed to have been entered into by the Borrower for purposes of Borrower s obligations under this Section 6.03(a). (b) Each Hedge Transaction shall be entered into with a Hedge Counterparty and be governed by a Hedging Agreement. Any Hedge Transaction that is in the form of an interest rate swap shall provide for the payment on each Payment Date to the Hedge Counterparty of an amount calculated by reference to the notional amount thereunder and a fixed rate of interest per annum and for the payment on each Payment Date to the Borrower of an amount calculated by reference to the same notional amount thereunder and a floating rate of interest (per annum equal to SOFR or a related rate), in each case for each day during the related Interest Period. Furthermore, the notional amount of each such Hedge Transaction shall amortize monthly based on an assumed 'ABS Rate' agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (ii) the 'Termination Events' and 'Events of Default' that are applicable under each such Hedge Transaction shall have been approved by the Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent prior to the effectiveness of such Hedge Transaction, and (iii) each such Hedge Transaction shall have a final maturity date reflecting the expected repayment of the Receivables, taking into account anticipated losses and prepayments. If a Hedge Counterparty, other than a Hedge Counterparty as defined in clause (i) of the definition thereof, met the Short-Term Ratings Requirement and/or the Long-Term Ratings Requirement at the time the related Hedge Transaction was entered into and is downgraded or has any ratings withdrawn such that it no longer meets the Short-Term Ratings Requirement and/or the Long-Term Ratings Requirement, as applicable, then within thirty (30) days of the related downgrade or withdrawal either (A) the Borrower must enter into a 99 

new Hedging Agreement or (B) the Hedge Counterparty must post collateral pursuant to a credit support annex in an amount satisfactory to the Required Lenders. (c) If on any date any Hedge Transactions are in the form of interest rate swaps and the aggregate notional amount under all outstanding Hedge Transactions as of such date is either (x) less than 95 of the Loans Outstanding as of such date (after giving effect to any changes to the Loans Outstanding on such date) or (y) more than 105 of the Loans Outstanding as of such date (after giving effect to any changes to the Loans Outstanding on such date), then on the related 'Adjustment Date' (which shall be either such date (if such date is a Payment Date) or otherwise the next Business Day after such date that is a Payment Date), the Administrative Agent may direct the Borrower to enter into one or more Hedge Transactions, increase the notional amount of one or more Hedge Transactions, or decrease the notional amount of one or more Hedge Transactions, in all cases as necessary such that immediately thereafter the aggregate notional amount under all Hedge Transactions is neither (I) less than 95 of the Loans Outstanding as of the Adjustment Date (after giving effect to any changes to the Loans Outstanding on such date) nor (II) more than one 105 of the Loans Outstanding as of the Adjustment Date (after giving effect to any changes to the Loans Outstanding on such date). (d) The Borrower shall establish and thereafter maintain a segregated trust account in the name of the Borrower with respect to each Hedge Counterparty (each, a 'Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account;) with a Qualified Institution in trust and for the benefit of the Lenders and the related Hedge Counterparty. In the event that pursuant to the terms of the applicable Hedging Agreement, the related Hedge Counterparty is required to deposit cash or securities as collateral to secure its obligations ('Posted Collateral'), the Borrower shall deposit all Posted Collateral received from the Hedge Counterparty into the Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account. All sums on deposit and securities held in any Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account shall be used only for the purposes set forth in the related credit support annex ('Credit Support Annex') to the Hedging Agreement. The only permitted withdrawal from or application of funds on deposit in, or otherwise to the credit of, a Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account shall be (i) for application to the obligations of the applicable Hedge Counterparty under the related Hedging Agreement in accordance with the terms of the related Credit Support Annex and (ii) to return collateral to the Hedge Counterparty when and as required by the Credit Support Annex. Amounts on deposit in each Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account shall be invested at the written direction of the related Hedge Counterparty, and all investment earnings actually received on amounts on deposit in a Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account or distributions on securities held as Posted Collateral shall be distributed to the related Hedge Counterparty in accordance with the terms of the related Credit Support Annex. Any amounts applied by the Borrower to the obligations of the Hedge Counterparty under the Hedging Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Credit Support Annex shall be deposited in the Collection Account and applied in accordance with Section 2.06 of this Agreement. The Borrower agrees to give the Hedge Counterparty prompt notice if it obtains knowledge that the Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account or any funds on deposit therein or otherwise to the credit of the Hedge Counterparty Collateral Account, shall or have become subject to any writ, order, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process. (e) Within 30 days after the occurrence of any event defined as an Event of Default or Termination Event in a Hedging Agreement, the Borrower shall cause such Hedge 100 

Counterparty to assign its obligations under the Hedging Agreement to a new Hedge Counterparty which satisfies the requirements set forth in the definition of Hedge Counterparty. (f) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of all documents related to any Hedging Agreement, including confirmations, schedules and an aggregate notional amortization schedule. (g) All reasonably documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders incurred with each Hedge Transaction shall be paid by the Borrower. (h) As additional security hereunder, the Borrower has granted a security interest to the Administrative Agent all right, title and interest of the Borrower in the Hedge Collateral. The Borrower acknowledges that, as a result of that pledge, the Borrower may not, without the prior written Consent of the Administrative Agent, exercise any rights under any Hedging Agreement or Hedge Transaction, except for the Borrower's right under any Hedging Agreement to enter into Hedge Transactions in order to meet the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

The initial Servicer will be required to pay all reasonable fees and expenses owing to any bank or trust company in connection with the maintenance of the Collection Account. The initial Servicer shall be required to pay such expenses for its own account and shall not be entitled to any payment therefor other than the Servicing Fee. Section 7.07. Reports and Audit. (a) Monthly Reports. On each Reporting Date, the Servicer will provide to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (for further delivery to each Agent), the Backup Servicer and, to the extent requested or required by a Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty, a Monthly Report. No such Monthly Report is required to have been executed by a Responsible Officer unless such Monthly Report is delivered on a Funding Date. (b) Quarterly Report. By the 15th of each February, May, August and November, commencing in August 2020, the Servicer will provide a Quarterly Report to the Administrative Agent (for further delivery to each Agent) and, to the extent requested or required by a Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty. The Administrative Agent or a Hedge Counterparty may request such report more frequently if required by regulators or to comply with Applicable Law (including Basel II and Basel III). (c) Serviced Portfolio Information. Upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, the initial Servicer shall provide, at its own expense, the Administrative Agent with information on the Serviced Portfolio regarding delinquencies, loss-to-liquidations, annualized losses and such other information as the Administrative Agent may request, but solely to the extent that such data is available to the Servicer without undue administrative burden or cost. (d) Audit. Once during each calendar year (commencing in 2020), at such times during normal business hours as are reasonably convenient to the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, at the sole cost and expense of the Servicer (provided, that such costs and expenses are reasonable and customary for similar types of inspections in the industry and do not exceed 75,000 per annum) and upon reasonable request of the Administrative Agent and prior written notice to the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall permit such Person or Persons as the Administrative Agent may designate (including the Backup Servicer or an independent accounting firm), with the approval of the Required Lenders, to conduct, on behalf of all of them, audits or to visit and inspect any of the properties of the Borrower or the Servicer where the Receivable Files are located, as the case may be, to examine the Receivable Files, internal controls and procedures maintained by the Borrower or Servicer, as the case may be, and take copies and extracts therefrom, and to discuss the affairs of the Borrower and the Servicer with their respective officers and employees (which employees, except after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Termination Event or 111 

Servicer Termination Event, shall be designated by the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be) and, upon written notice to the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, independent accountants. The scope of any audit or inspection will be a scope agreed upon between the Servicer and the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may request to take the foregoing actions more than once per calendar year if it has a commercially reasonable basis for requesting such actions, but any additional inspections and audits shall be at the expense of the Administrative Agent. After the occurrence and during the continuation of a Termination Event, Unmatured Termination Event, Unmatured Servicer Termination Event or Servicer Termination Event, the Administrative Agent, the Backup Servicer and their respective representatives shall be permitted to take the foregoing actions without being subject to any limitation on the number of audits, visits or inspections that may be conducted during a calendar year and such audits, visits or inspections shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Servicer and such costs and expenses shall not be subject to a cap; provided, that the Administrative Agent and its representatives shall make reasonable efforts to coordinate, and provide a prior written notice of, such audits, visits and inspections. The Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, hereby authorizes such officers, employees and independent accountants to discuss with the Administrative Agent and its representatives, the affairs of the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be. The Servicer shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Secured Parties in connection with the foregoing actions promptly upon receipt of a written invoice therefor. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any Applicable Law prohibiting the disclosure of information regarding the Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access to information as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this subsection. In the case of any Successor Servicer, any fees or expenses of the Servicer referenced in this Section shall be reimbursable in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06. Section 7.08. Quarterly Statement as to Compliance. The initial Servicer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, (a) within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 and (b) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter thereafter, an Officer's Certificate, stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the preceding quarterly period (or since the Closing Date in the case of the first such Officer's Certificate) and of its performance under this Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision and (ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement throughout such quarter (or such shorter period in the case of the first such Officer's Certificate), or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer and the nature and status thereof.

At any time following the assumption of the duties of the Servicer by the Backup Servicer, in its capacity as Successor Servicer, or the designation of a Successor Servicer (other than the Backup Servicer) pursuant to Section 7.14 as a result of the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event: (a) The Servicer, on behalf of the Borrower, shall, at the Administrative Agent's request, (i) assemble all of the records relating to the Collateral, including all Receivable Files, and shall make the same available to the Administrative Agent, the Backup Servicer or any Successor Servicer at a place selected by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) segregate all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections of Collateral in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Backup Servicer or such other Successor Servicer and shall, no later than two Business Days after receipt, remit all such cash, checks and instruments, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer, to, or at the direction of, the Administrative Agent.

(c) The Successor Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically undertaken by the Successor Servicer in such capacity herein. Such liability is limited to only those actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Successor Servicer and caused through its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Successor Servicer and, in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Successor Servicer may conclusively rely on the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed in any certificates or opinions furnished to the Successor Servicer and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement. (d) The Successor Servicer shall not be charged with actual or constructive knowledge of any Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event unless a Responsible Officer of the Successor Servicer obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Successor Servicer receives written notice of such event from the Borrower, the Servicer or the Administrative Agent. 113 

(e) The Successor Servicer shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risks or liability is not reasonably assured to it in writing prior to the expenditure of such funds or the incurrence of financial liability. Section 7.11. Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others. Except as expressly provided herein, neither the Servicer nor any of its directors or officers or employees or agents shall be under any liability to the Secured Parties or any other Person for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such Person against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of its willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of its willful misconduct hereunder.

All actions taken by the Administrative 116

(b) In the event that there is no Backup Servicer at the time that the Servicer is terminated hereunder, or the Administrative Agent does not so appoint the Backup Servicer to succeed the Servicer as Successor Servicer hereunder, or the Backup Servicer is unable to assume such obligations on such date, the Administrative Agent shall as promptly as possible appoint a successor servicer (each such party so appointed or, as applicable, the Backup Servicer as successor to the Servicer, collectively, the Successor Servicer ), and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent. (c) Upon the termination and removal of the Servicer, the predecessor Servicer shall cooperate with the Successor Servicer in effecting the termination of the rights and responsibilities of the predecessor Servicer under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Successor Servicer for administration by it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the predecessor Servicer for deposit, or shall thereafter be received, with respect to a Receivable, and the related accounts and records maintained by the Servicer. In the case that the Successor Servicer shall not agree to perform any duties or obligations of the Servicer hereunder, such duties or obligations may be performed or delegated by the Administrative Agent. (d) The Administrative Agent shall have the same rights of removal and termination for cause with respect to the Successor Servicer as with respect to DFC as the Servicer.

The indemnification obligations of the Successor Servicer are expressly limited to those instances of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Successor Servicer. Furthermore, to the extent that the Backup Servicing Agreement provides that any representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements made hereunder by the Servicer, or obligations undertaken hereunder by the Servicer, shall not be made or performed, or shall be made or performed in an alternative manner, by the Backup Servicer in the event that the Backup Servicer becomes the Successor Servicer hereunder, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Agents, the Collateral Custodian and the Lenders agree that the representations, warranties, covenants, other agreement and other obligations of the Servicer hereunder shall not be applicable with respect to, or shall be modified with respect to, the Backup Servicer in its capacity as Successor Servicer and in the manner set forth in the Backup Servicing Agreement. (h) All authority and power granted to the Servicer under this Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of this Agreement and shall pass to and be vested in the Borrower and the Borrower is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights.

Section 7.16. Responsibilities of the Borrower. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower shall (i) perform, or cause the Servicer to perform, all of its obligations under the Receivables to the same extent as if a security interest in such Receivables had not been granted hereunder, and the exercise by the Administrative Agent of its rights hereunder shall not relieve the Borrower from such obligations and (ii) pay when due, from funds available to the Borrower under Section 2.06(xii), any Taxes, including any sales taxes payable in connection with the Receivables and their creation and satisfaction. No Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivable, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Borrower thereunder. Section 7.17. Custody of Receivable Files. To assure uniform quality in servicing the Receivables and to reduce administrative costs, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, hereby revocably appoints the Collateral Custodian as its agent, and the Collateral Custodian hereby accepts such appointment, to act as custodian, on behalf of the Secured Parties, of the Receivables and the Receivable Files.

The Collateral Custodian shall maintain such accurate and complete accounts, records and computer systems pertaining to each Receivable File as shall enable the Servicer and the Borrower to comply with this Agreement. In performing its duties as custodian, the Collateral Custodian shall act with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that it exercises with respect to the files of comparable motor 119 

vehicle installment sale contracts and installment loans that the Collateral Custodian holds for itself or others. The Collateral Custodian shall maintain continuous custody of the Receivable Files and such other documents received by it in secure, fire resistant facilities. Each Receivable shall be identified on the books and records of the Collateral Custodian in a manner that (i) indicates that the Receivable is held by the Collateral Custodian on behalf of the Secured Parties, and (ii) is otherwise necessary, as reasonably determined by the Collateral Custodian to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Custodian shall report to the Administrative Agent any failure on its part to hold the Receivable Files and to maintain its accounts, records and computer systems as herein provided and take appropriate action to remedy any such failure. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require an initial review or any periodic review of the Receivable Files by the Secured Parties, and none of the Secured Parties shall be liable or responsible for any action or failure to act by the Servicer in its capacity as custodian hereunder. (b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Collateral Custodian shall maintain each Receivable File at one of the locations specified in Schedule D or, if a material portion of the Receivables Files are to be held in any other location, the Collateral Custodian will provide 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, each Agent and each Lender. The Collateral Custodian may temporarily move individual Receivable Files or any portion thereof without notice as necessary to conduct collection and other servicing activities in accordance with its customary practices and procedures. The Collateral Custodian shall make available to the Secured Parties or their duly authorized representatives, attorneys or auditors a list of locations of the Receivable Files, the Receivable Files and the related accounts, records and computer systems maintained by the Servicer at such times during normal business hours as any Secured Party shall reasonably request. (c) Title to Receivables. The Receivable Files and the other documents delivered to the Collateral Custodian will be delivered from time to time to the Collateral Custodian for the sole purpose of holding for safekeeping. The Collateral Custodian shall not at any time have, or in any way attempt to assert, any interest in any Receivable held by it as custodian hereunder or in the related Receivable File, other than for collecting or enforcing such Receivable for the benefit of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. (d) Instructions; Authority to Act. The Collateral Custodian shall be deemed to have received proper instructions with respect to the Receivable Files upon its receipt of written instructions signed by a Responsible Officer of the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders). (e) Indemnification by Collateral Custodian. The Collateral Custodian, in its capacity as custodian of the Receivable Files, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Secured Parties and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all loss, liability or expense that may be imposed on, incurred or asserted against the Secured Parties and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents as the result of any improper act or omission in any way relating to the maintenance and custody of the Receivable Files by the Collateral Custodian; provided, that the Collateral Custodian shall not be liable for 120 

any portion of any such loss, liability or expense resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of any Secured Party. (f) Effective Period and Termination. The Collateral Custodian's appointment as custodian shall become effective as of the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect until terminated pursuant to this Section. If the initial Servicer is terminated following a Servicer Termination Event, the appointment of the Collateral Custodian as custodian hereunder may be terminated by the Administrative Agent. As soon as practicable after any such resignation or termination of such appointment, the Administrative Agent shall appoint a successor Collateral Custodian to be custodian of the Receivable Files and the accounts and records relating thereto and the Collateral Custodian shall, at its sole cost and expense, (i) deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Receivable Files and the related accounts and records maintained by the Collateral Custodian to such successor Collateral Custodian, or its agent or designee, as the case may be, at such place as such successor Collateral Custodian may reasonably designate and (ii) otherwise cooperate with the successor Collateral Custodian in affecting the termination of the rights and responsibilities of the predecessor Collateral Custodian under this Agreement. From and after the appointment of a successor Collateral Custodian, the predecessor Collateral Custodian shall continue to perform all custodial functions under this Agreement until the date specified by the Administrative Agent in writing or, if no such date is specified, until a date mutually agreed upon by the predecessor Collateral Custodian and the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, at the time described in immediately preceding sentence, appoint the Backup Servicer as the successor Collateral Custodian hereunder, and the Backup Servicer shall on such date assume all obligations of the Collateral Custodian hereunder, and all authority and power of the predecessor Collateral Custodian under this Agreement shall pass to and be vested in the Backup Servicer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as DFC is the Collateral Custodian, the right to conduct inspections of the Collateral Custodian shall be governed by the provisions of Section 7.07(d). (h) Delegation of Duties. (i) The Collateral Custodian may perform any of its duties through one or more custodial agents without the consent of any Person, except as set forth in clause (iii) below. No such delegation will relieve the Collateral Custodian of its responsibilities with respect to such duties and the Collateral Custodian will remain primarily responsible with respect to such duties, and the Collateral Custodian acknowledges that it remains primarily responsible for the safeguarding of all such Receivable Files and shall be liable for any acts or omissions of such custodial agents 121 

while acting on its behalf. The Collateral Custodian will be responsible for the fees of any such custodial agents.

Administrative Agent may, or at the direction of the Required Lenders, shall, exercise in respect of the Collateral the following remedial actions, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies otherwise available to it, including rights available hereunder and all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the UCC (such rights and remedies to be cumulative and nonexclusive): (a) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the Borrower except as required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the Loans Outstanding, any Interest accrued thereon and/or any other amount due and owing to any Secured Party against amounts payable to the Borrower from the Collection Account or any part of such account in accordance with the priorities required by Section 2.06. (b) The Administrative Agent may take any action permitted under the Basic Documents, including, without limitation, delivering any shifting control or similar notice under the Control Agreement. (c) Consistent with the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (and except as otherwise required by the UCC), the Administrative Agent may, on behalf of itself and the Lenders and without notice except as specified below, solicit and accept bids for and sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at the Administrative Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten Business Days' notice to the Borrower of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Every such sale shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever of the Borrower in and to the Collateral so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against the Borrower or any Person claiming the Collateral sold through the Borrower and its successors or assigns. (d) Upon the completion of any sale under Section 8.02(c), the Borrower will deliver or cause to be delivered all of the Collateral sold to the purchaser or purchasers at such sale on the date of sale, or within a reasonable time thereafter if it shall be impractical to make immediate delivery, but in any event full title and right of possession to such property shall pass to such purchaser or purchasers forthwith upon the completion of such sale. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent or by any purchaser, the Borrower shall confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to such purchaser all proper instruments of conveyance and transfer and release as may be designated in any such request. 126 

(e) At any sale under Section 8.02(c), DFC, the Performance Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability therefor. Any Secured Party purchasing property at a sale under Section 8.02(c) may set off the purchase price of such property against amounts owing to such Secured Party in full payment of such purchase price. (f) The Administrative Agent may direct the Servicer to direct Collections to an account other than the Lockbox Account or the Collection Account. (g) The Administrative Agent may exercise at the Borrower's sole expense any and all rights and remedies of the Borrower under or in connection with the Collateral. Section 8.03. Exercise of Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Agent or the Secured Parties, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Parties would otherwise have pursuant to law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. Section 8.04. Waiver of Certain Laws. The Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and the Borrower, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such laws, and any and all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the Collateral as an entirety or such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine. Section 8.05. Power of Attorney. The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true and lawful attorney (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, in connection with the enforcement of the rights and remedies provided for in this Article, including: (i) to give any necessary receipts or acquittance for amounts collected or received hereunder, (ii) to make all necessary transfers of the Collateral in connection with any sale or other disposition made pursuant hereto, (iii) to execute and deliver 127 

for value all necessary or appropriate bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any such sale or other disposition, the Borrower thereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do hereunder and pursuant hereto and (iv) to sign any agreements, orders or other documents in connection with or pursuant to any Basic Document. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an executed power of attorney in the form of Exhibit D on the Closing Date. If so requested by the Administrative Agent, directly or through a purchaser of any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent or such purchaser all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other instruments as may be designated in any such request.

(e) No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any breach of this Agreement or the occurrence of any Servicer Termination Event, Early Amortization Event, Step-up Event, Stop-Funding Event, or Termination Event unless it has received notice from the Borrower, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer or any Lender, referring to this Agreement and describing such event. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to each Agent, and in the event any Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders in its Lender Group. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, and each Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as shall be reasonably directed by (i) all Owners in its Lender Group and (ii) all Lenders in its Lender Group; provided, that unless and until such Agent shall have received such directions, such Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such event as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders or of the Lenders in its Lender Group, as applicable. Section 10.05. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, the Servicer, DFC, the Backup Servicer or the Collateral Custodian shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower, the Servicer, DFC, the Backup Servicer or the Collateral Custodian and the Receivables and made its own decision to purchase its interest in the Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under any of the Basic Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower, the Servicer, DFC, the Backup Servicer or the Collateral Custodian and the Receivables. Except for notices, reports and other documents received by an Agent hereunder, no Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower, the Servicer, DFC, the Backup Servicer or the Collateral Custodian or the Receivables which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. Section 10.06. Indemnification. The Lenders (i) agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (without limiting the obligation (if any) of the Borrower or the Servicer to reimburse the Administrative Agent for any such amounts), ratably according to their 135 

respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have terminated, Invested Percentages) and (ii) in each Lender Group agree to indemnify the Agent for such Lender Group in its capacity as such (without limiting the obligation (if any) of the Borrower and the Servicer to reimburse such Agent for any such amounts), ratably according to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have terminated, Invested Percentages), in each case from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the payment of the obligations under this Agreement, including the Loans Outstanding) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of an Agent resulting from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The provisions of this Section shall survive the payment of the obligations under this Agreement, including the Loans Outstanding, the termination of this Agreement, and any resignation or removal of the applicable Agent. Section 10.07. Agents in their Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and any other party to a Basic Document as though it were not an Agent hereunder. In addition, the Lenders acknowledge that one or more Persons which are Agents may act (i) as administrator, sponsor or agent for one or more Lenders and in such capacity act and may continue to act on behalf of each such Lender in connection with its business, and (ii) as the agent for certain financial institutions under the liquidity and credit enhancement agreements relating to this Agreement to which any one or more Lenders is party and in various other capacities relating to the business of any such Lender under various agreements. Any such Person, in its capacity as Agent, shall not, by virtue of its acting in any such other capacities, be deemed to have duties or responsibilities hereunder or be held to a standard of care in connection with the performance of its duties as an Agent other than as expressly provided in this Agreement. Any Person which is an Agent may act as an Agent without regard to and without additional duties or liabilities arising from its role as such administrator or agent or arising from its acting in any such other capacity. None of the provisions to this Agreement shall require the Administrative Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured to it. Section 10.08. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may assign its rights and obligations hereunder with the consent of the Required Lenders and upon ten days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon ten days' notice to the Lenders, each Agent and the Borrower with such resignation becoming effective upon a successor agent succeeding to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor administrative agent. Any successor administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of resigning Administrative Agent, and the term Administrative Agent shall mean such 136 

successor administrative agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Section 10.09. Erroneous Payments. (a) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a 'Payment') were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender under this Section 10.09(a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (b) Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a 'Payment Notice') or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. (c) The Borrower hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such 137 

Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower. (d) Each party s obligations under this Section 10.09 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Basic Document.
