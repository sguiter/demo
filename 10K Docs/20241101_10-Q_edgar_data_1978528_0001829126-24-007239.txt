units (the Public Units ), including the full exercise of the over-allotment option of Units granted to the underwriters. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor units at per unit (the Private Units in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 

Transaction costs amounted to , consisted of cash underwriting fees (net of expense reimbursement from the underwriters), deferred underwriting fees (payable only upon completion of a Business Combination) and other offering costs. 

Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement on October 11, 2023, a total of was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company as a trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and the liquidation due to the Company s failure to complete a Business Combination within the applicable period of time. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. In addition, interest income earned on the funds in the Trust Account may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations. With these exceptions, expenses incurred by the Company may be paid prior to a business combination only from the net proceeds of the IPO and private placement not held in the Trust Account. 

Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the Company s initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least of the value of the funds in the Trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account), which the Company refers to as the 80 test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial Business Combination, although the Company may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80 of the trust account balance. If the Company is no longer listed on Nasdaq, it will not be required to satisfy the 80 test. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) (the Initial Stockholders and the underwriters have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares, Private Shares (as defined in Note 4), Shares issued as underwriting commissions (see Note 6) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any shares (including the Founder Shares) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve, or sell the shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with, a proposed Business Combination. 

If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The Initial Stockholders have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Shares, and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

The Company will have nine months (or 15 months or up to 21 months if it extends such period) from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate its initial Business Combination within nine months, it may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of 15 months to complete a business combination). In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliate or designees must deposit into the Trust Account 0.10 per Public Share) for each extension, or an aggregate of , on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less certain amount of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The Sponsor and the other Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares, and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or the other Initial Stockholders acquires Public Shares in or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than . 

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below 10.10 per Public Share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. 

Pursuant to Article Sixth D of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company is entitled to an automatic six-month extension of the then-current deadline to complete a business combination after the execution of a letter of intent LOI or definitive agreement to complete a business combination. On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding LOI with a business combination target (the Target ), regarding a potential business combination involving the Target and its subsidiaries (the Proposed Transaction ). The Target is a clinical-stage therapeutics company. 

The LOI is non-binding and no agreement providing for any Proposed Transaction or any other transaction or the participation by either party therein will be deemed to exist unless and until definitive agreements have been executed. 

As a result of the execution of the LOI, the deadline
by which the Company must complete its initial business combination has been extended to January 11, 2025. 

The parties were unable to agree to the terms of
a definitive agreement and the negotiations have been terminated. 

Going Concern Consideration 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had in cash and a working capital deficit of . The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO had been satisfied through a payment from the Sponsor of for the Founder Shares and the loan under an unsecured promissory note from the Sponsor of (see Note 5). 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such an additional condition also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

As a result of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine, Hamas/Israel conflicts and/or other future global conflicts, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and potential future sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

The Company will continue to monitor for updates to the Company s business along with guidance issued with respect to the IR Act to determine whether any adjustments are needed to the Company s tax provision in future periods.

The provision for income taxes was and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the change in valuation of deferred tax assets.

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on May 1, 2023. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to herein as our initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus on target businesses in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, and Macau) that operate in the financial technology sector. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering IPO as defined below) and the private placement of Private Units, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial business combination. 

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial business combination will be successful. 

Recent Developments 

Pursuant to Article Sixth D of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company was entitled to an automatic six-month extension of the then-current deadline to
complete a business combination after the execution of a letter of intent LOI or definitive agreement to complete a
business combination. On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding LOI with a business combination target (the
 Target ), regarding a potential business combination involving the Target and its subsidiaries (the Proposed
Transaction ). The Target is a clinical-stage therapeutics company. 

The LOI was non-binding and no agreement providing for any Proposed Transaction or any other transaction or the participation by either party therein will be deemed to exist unless and until definitive agreements have been executed. 

As a result of the execution of the LOI, the deadline
by which the Company must complete its initial business combination has been extended to January 11, 2025. 

The parties were unable to agree to terms of a definitive
agreement and the negotiations have been terminated.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our activities from May 1, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our IPO, which is described below, and subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. 

We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 603,904, which consisted of formation and operational costs of 99,012, related party administrative fees of 30,000, franchise tax expense of 16,500 and income tax expense of 194,826, offset by interest income of 944,242. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 1,760,025, which consisted of formation and operational costs of 326,266, related party administrative fees of 90,000, franchise tax expense of 50,177 and income tax expense of 578,508, offset by interest income of 2,804,976. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 2,949, all of which consisted of interest income. 

For the period from May 1, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,686, all of which consisted of interest income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On October 11, 2023, we completed our initial public offering IPO of 6,900,000 units (the Public Units ), including the full exercise of the over-allotment option of 900,000 Units granted to the underwriters. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock and one-tenth (1/10) of one right Public Right ). Each Public Right will convert into one share of common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination. Simultaneously with the IPO, we sold to our Sponsor 253,045 units at 10.00 per unit (the Private Units in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of 2,530,450. The Private Units are identical to the Public Units except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. Each Private Unit consists of one share of common stock Private Share and one-tenth (1/10) of one right Private Right ). Each Private Right will convert into one share of common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, we issued the underwriters 69,000 shares of common stock for the representative shares, at the closing of the IPO as part of representative compensation. 

Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement on October 11, 2023, a total of 69,690,000 was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company as a trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. 

We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the private placement, including the funds held in the Trust Account, in connection with our initial business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in the IPO in an amount equal to 3.5 of the total gross proceeds raised in the IPO upon consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial business combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 329,359 and a working capital deficit (current assets less current liabilities) of 543,906. 

18 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than described below. 

Administrative Services Agreement 

We have entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay the Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, the Sponsor agreed to defer the payment of such monthly fee. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred 30,000 and 90,000, respectively, in related party fees for the services provided by the Sponsor under this agreement. 

Underwriting Agreement 

Upon closing of a Business Combination, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 2,415,000. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Additionally, we issued the underwriters 69,000 shares common stock, or the representative shares, at the closing of the IPO as part of representative compensation. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of unaudited financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies and estimates. 

19 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 mostly requires, on an annual basis, disclosure of specific categories in an entity s effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The incremental disclosures may be presented on a prospective or retrospective basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2023-09 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation with the participation of management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
