The
principal amount of the 806,000 Note and all interest accrued thereon is payable on August 10, 2022, and is secured by a lien on substantially
all of the Company s assets. The 806,000 Note provides for interest at the rate of per annum, payable at maturity, and is convertible

The
principal amount of the 440,000 Note and all interest accrued thereon is payable on July 19, 2023, and are secured by a lien on substantially
all of the Company s assets. The 440,000 Note provides for interest at the rate of per annum, payable at maturity, and is convertible
into common stock at a price of per share. In addition to customary anti-dilution adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate
events, the 440,000 Note provides, subject to certain limited exceptions, that if the Company issues any common stock or common stock
equivalents, as defined in the 440,000 Note, at a per share price lower than the conversion price then in effect, the conversion price
will be reduced to the per share price at which such stock or common stock equivalents were sold. 

The
 440,000 Note
provides for various events of default similar to those provided for in similar transactions, including the failure to timely pay amounts
due thereunder. The 440,000 Note provides further that the Company will be liable to the
Mercer Fund for various amounts, including the cost of a buy-in, if the Company shall default in its obligation to register the shares

Act or otherwise fails to facilitate Buyer s sale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 440,000 Note
as required by the terms of the 440,000 Note. In the event of a default, the interest
rate on the outstanding principal would increase during the continuance of the default to a Default Interest Rate defined in the 440,000
Note. Additionally, all outstanding amounts would be paid at the holder s discretion at a Mandatory Default Amount also defined
in the 440,000 Note. 

On
February 19, 2024 the Company received the most recent notice from the manager of the Mercer Fund, LLC that it agreed to forbear from
exercising any rights it might have as a result of any defaults under the 440,000 Note and the related documents between the Company
and the Fund, provided that it reserved all of its rights. 

The
 Warrants are initially exercisable for a period of three years at a price of per share, subject to customary anti-dilution
adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events as set forth in the Warrant. The shares issuable upon conversion of the 440,000
Note and exercise of the Warrants are to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for resale by the investor as provided
in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Warrants may be exercised by means of a cashless exercise if at any time the
shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are not covered by an effective registration statement. 

The
Company accounts for the allocation of its issuance costs related to its Warrants in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion
and Other Options . Under this guidance, if debt or stock is issued with detachable warrants, the proceeds need to be allocated to
the two instruments using either the fair value method, the relative fair value method, or the residual value method. The Company used
the relative fair value at the time of issuance to allocate the value received between the convertible note and the warrants. 

The
Company estimated the fair value of the Warrants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model, which is dependent upon several assumptions
such as the expected term of the Warrants, expected volatility of the Company s stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free
interest rate over the expected term and expected dividend yield rate over the expected term. The Company believes this valuation methodology
is appropriate for estimating the fair value of warrants. The value allocated to the relative fair value of the Warrants was recorded
as debt issuance costs and additional paid in capital. 

The
principal, net of the original issue discount and debt issuance costs, including the allocated relative fair value of the Warrants,
which are being recognized over the life of the 440,000 Note, along with associated interest, is recorded with current liabilities
on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, without
giving effect to additional interest and penalties of 
and 
which Mercer may demand as a result of the Company s default under the terms of the 440,000 Note, the 440,000 Note had
 
and

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of
operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report, and our annual
report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained
in such Report. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our
actual results may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary
Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

We
are a medical device technology and software as a service SaaS company focused on enabling primary care physicians PCPs to increase their revenues by providing them with relevant, value-based tools to evaluate and treat chronic disease as well as provide
preventive care through reimbursable procedures. In some cases, the products we provide our physician clients will enable them to diagnose
and treat patients with chronic diseases which they historically have referred to specialists, allowing them to increase their practice
revenue. As part of our mission, we are providing PCPs with the software, training and devices necessary to allow them to treat their
patients using value-based healthcare, informatics and algorithmic personalized medicine, including digital therapeutics. Our virtual
and point of care solutions also support non face to face clinical decision making and remote patient monitoring, to address chronic
care and preventive medicine and are reimbursable to the medical practice. 

Increasingly,
regulators and insurance companies have come to recognize what health care technologists have been saying for nearly 17 years, which
is that most chronic conditions are better managed with more frequent and short encounters often without a physician s direct participation,
rather than infrequent visits. More health insurers have realized that AI enabled digital medicine technologies such as those provided
through QHSLab can provide the necessary encounters to foster patient compliance in between visits to a physician. 

Based
on the success of PCPs using our QHSLab allergy diagnostics combined with the products acquired from MedScience, we intend to increase
our revenues by charging physicians a monthly subscription fee for the use of QHSLab and soliciting additional PCPs to increase their
revenues by using our proven revenue generating QHSLab and Allergi End line of products. We also plan to introduce additional
point of care diagnostics and treatments, and digital medicine programs that PCPs can use and prescribe in their practices. In all cases,
PCPs will be paid under existing government and private insurance programs, based upon analyses conducted utilizing QHSLab and treatments
provided as a result of such analyses. 

Our
ability to operate profitably is determined by our ability to generate revenues from the licensing of our QHSLab software and the sale
of diagnostic related products and treatment protocols and the provision of services through our QHSLab system. Currently, we are generating
revenues from the sale of Allergi End diagnostic related products and immunotherapy treatments. Our ability to generate a
profit from these sales is determined by our ability to increase the number of physicians using these products. We will continue to upgrade
QHSLab in an effort to increase the number of products sold based upon the services it can provide and for which we are able to charge
a fee for its use.

Results
of Operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023 

Revenues 

During
the fourth quarter of 2020 we began to sell the Allergi End Products, consisting of Allergi End Allergy Diagnostics
and Allergen Immunotherapy treatments, to physicians. During the second quarter of 2022, we began to enter SaaS subscription agreements
to provide physicians with access to our proprietary internally-developed QHSLab platform software that provides clinical
decision support and patient assessments for numerous chronic conditions seen in primary care settings including allergy, asthma, anxiety,
depression, and chronic pain for example . During the fourth quarter of 2022, we began entering into Integrated Service Program ISP agreements to provide physicians offices with agreed-upon clinical decision support, digital health assessments,
administrative, and billing services utilizing our QHSLab platform software. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we entered
into a clinical study agreement with a third party to provide clinical research services utilizing our QHSLab platform software. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 544,285 compared to 336,407 of revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 which was driven by a 126 increase in our ISP revenues combined with the recognition of the initial milestone related
to our clinical study during the period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 1,505,945 compared to 1,093,974 of revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues in the first nine months of 2024 were attributed to a 143 increase in revenues generated
from ISP services to 449,203 compared to 184,803 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; a 21 increase in sales of Allergy
Diagnostic Kits to 648,175 compared to 536,738 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the inclusion of revenues as a result
of the achievement of the initial performance obligation associated with our clinical study.

Cost
of Revenues and Gross Profit 

Cost
of revenues consists of the cost of Allergi End test kits and allergen immunotherapy pharmacy prepared treatment sets, shipping
costs to our customers as well as administrative services and labor expenses directly related to our ISP sales. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 179,152 and 146,897, respectively. 

The
Company generated a gross profit of 365,133 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 189,510 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin improved to 67.1 for the quarter compared to 56.3 during the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenues was 560,209 and 490,294, respectively. 

The
Company generated a gross profit of 945,736 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 603,680 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased from 55.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 62.8 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross margin for both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was
attributable to a combination of changes in the product mix including the growth of ISP revenue and improved cost structure since the
acquisition of intangible assets from MedScience and synergies across our core product lines as well as the recognition of revenue as
a result of the achievement of the initial research performance obligation associated with the clinical study which utilizes
costs already included in cost of goods sold. 

As
we continue to introduce new products at an early stage in our development cycle, our gross margins may vary significantly between periods,
due, among other things, to differences among our customers and products sold, customer negotiating strengths, and product mix. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs associated with selling and marketing our products to PCPs, principally ongoing sales
efforts to recruit new PCPs and maintain our relationships with PCPs already using our software and products. These expenses include
employee compensation and costs of consultants. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses totaled 122,816,
an increase of 8,797 compared to 114,019 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses totaled 378,946, an increase of 12,891 compared to 366,055
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increases in sales and marketing expenses for the periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 relate primarily
to increases in marketing expenses and payroll-related expenses as we are investing in more sales and marketing activities to support
our increasing ISP revenue. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we seek to build our customer base
and launch additional products. Nevertheless, if we are successful in onboarding a sufficient number of PCPs and maintaining our relationships
with these PCPs once they begin to fully utilize our products, sales and marketing expenses could decrease as a percentage of revenues,
though we may increase our marketing efforts as funds become available. 

20 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with operating a business including accounting, legal and management
consulting fees. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses totaled 55,699, an increase of 8,422, compared to 47,277
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses totaled 193,096 a decrease of 12,703, compared to 205,799
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase general and administrative expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to increases in sales processing,
cloud-related hosting and legal fees partially offset by continued decreases in management consulting services. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the larger decreases in management consulting services
earlier in the year more than offsetting the increases in the sales processing, cloud-related hosting and legal fees during the period. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development R D includes expenses incurred in connection with the research and development of our medical device
technology solution, including software development. R D costs are expensed as they are incurred. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, R D expenses totaled 79,500 which is an increase of 34,081 compared to 45,419 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R D expenses totaled 186,949 which is an increase of 17,460 compared to 169,489 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in R D expenses for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, was driven by increases
in software development expenses as we continue to expand the commercialization of our QHSLab platform software and R D consulting
expenses including the appointment of a medical and scientific affairs liaison during the second quarter of 2024. We expect that our
R D expenses will continue to increase as we invest in and expand our operations and further develop new products and services as
part of our growth strategy. 

Other
Income and Expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense decreased by 9,256 to 39,325 from 48,581 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense decreased by 87,957 to 104,311 from 192,268 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
decrease was due to timing of the amortization of debt issuance costs including legal fees and warrants issued in connection with certain
of our convertible notes payable. Interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 included only interest on the outstanding debt
balance as all debt issuance costs including legal fees and warrants issued in connection with the second Mercer note in July 2022 Second
OID Note and the first Mercer note issued in August 2021 First OID Note were fully amortized by the end of 2023.
The amortization of those costs, which are non-cash expenses, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 6,701, or 12 
of interest expense during the quarter and 61,836, or 32 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

There
was no other income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,371 for the three months and 2,290 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which were related to the redemption of awards on a credit card.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is a measure of a company s ability to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and
otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On September 30, 2024, we had current assets totaling 349,274, including 95,945 of cash, 198,221
of accounts receivable, 40,033 of inventory, and 15,075 related to prepaid expenses and other current assets. At such date we had total
current liabilities of 2,089,850 consisting of 243,143 in accounts payable, 140,539 in other current liabilities and 1,706,168 representing
the current portions of outstanding loans and convertible notes. There was 10,060 in long-term liabilities on our balance sheet related
to the non-current portion of a loan payable. 

On
December 31, 2023, we had current assets totaling 156,132, including 51,582 of cash, 71,382 of accounts receivable, 25,181 of inventory,
and 7,987 related to prepaid expenses and other current assets. At such date we had total current liabilities of 2,057,049 consisting
of 78,907 in accounts payable, 196,590 in other current liabilities and 1,781,552 representing the current portions of outstanding
loans and convertible notes. There were no long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as the entirety of our loans payable are included
in current liabilities. 

We
generated cash flows of 87,387 from operations during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, we used cash of 24,462 in operations
during the same period ending September 30, 2023. The generation rather than use of cash was driven by an increase in revenue and improved gross margins during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. 

During
the third quarter of 2021, we issued a promissory note of 750,000 (the Acquisition Note in connection with our acquisition
of assets related to our Allergi End products and an Original Issue Discount Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the principal
amount of 806,000 (the First OID Note along with warrants to purchase 930,000 shares of our common stock (the Warrants for aggregate consideration of 750,000. In July 2022, to supplement our cash on hand, we issued to the holder of the First OID Note
an Original Issue Discount Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the Second OID Note in the principal amount of 440,000
and warrants to purchase 550,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of 400,000. 

All
amounts outstanding under the First OID Note and Second OID Note were payable on August 10, 2022, and July 19, 2023, respectively, and
are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. 

The
remaining principal and interest accrued on the Acquisition Note was 423,931 as of September 30, 2024, and we are in default under this
Note. We last received a notice of forbearance from the holder of the Acquisition Note on February 19, 2024, in which it reserved all
of its rights. We also are currently in default of our obligations under the First OID Note and the Second OID Note. We last received
a notice of forbearance from the manager of Mercer Street Global Opportunity Fund, LLC, the holder of the First and Second OID Notes,
on February 19, 2024, in which it reserved all rights it might have as a result of our defaults under the First OID Note, the Second
OID Note and the related documents between us and the Fund. Amounts accrued as interest under the Acquisition Note, the First and Second
OID Notes do not include interest and penalties which would be payable if the holder of such Notes elects to exercise its rights under
the default provisions of the Notes. There is no guarantee that the manager of Mercer Street Global Opportunity Fund, LLC and the holder
of the Acquisition Note will continue to forbear from exercising such rights as they may have to collect amounts due, including seeking
to foreclose upon such liens they may have on our assets. 

22 

Plan
of Operation and Funding 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had an accumulated deficit of
 4,014,143 at September 30, 2024, generated net income of 28,350 and net losses of 381,725 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and generated cash from operations of 87,387 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and used 159,627 of cash in operations in the year ended December 31, 2023. We are currently in default of our
obligations under our OID Notes and the Acquisition Note. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to
obtain necessary equity or debt financing and ultimately from generating revenues and positive cash flow to continue operations and,
in the interim, to convince the holders of our notes to forbear from exercising any rights they might have as a result of our
defaults. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our
working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. We will remain highly leveraged as we
seek to expand our business. Existing working capital and anticipated cash flows are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over
the next twelve months. If necessary, we would seek to supplement such amounts through the issuance of debt or equity. 

In
addition to using our cash to satisfy our working capital needs, we have begun to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness to avoid
continued growth in the amount of accrued interest and penalties, and to retain the support of our lenders. While the holders of our
First and Second OID Notes and MedScience have agreed to forbear from exercising their rights as a result of our defaults at this time,
there is no guarantee they will continue to do so. If they elect to exercise their rights, the amount of accrued interest and penalties
owed under the agreements will substantially increase. Further, should they demand immediate payment of all amounts currently due and,
in the case of Mercer, exercise its rights under its Security Agreements, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and
jeopardize our ability to continue operations. Any future effort to restructure existing indebtedness through agreements with our current
lenders to allow us to increase the amount we can devote to expanding our operations will require the consent of our current lenders
and likely would require the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. Should we seek to raise additional capital to satisfy
our lenders, there is no assurance sufficient amounts will be available. 

While
we are focused on our business, we intend to continually explore our options to raise additional capital or, when available, borrow additional
funds on terms which we believe are favorable to us. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution
to our current shareholders, could require the issuance of equity securities at prices we believe are below our true value and could
cause the price of our common stock to decrease. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our
common stock. Additional borrowings could require that we grant the lenders a security interest or other rights that impede our ability
to operate as we deem best for our shareholders. Further, any default under a loan agreement could result in an action which could force
us to seek bankruptcy protection. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to maintain or expand our existing operations, take advantage
of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business and adversely
impact our financial results. 

Our
ability to obtain funds through the issuance of debt or equity is dependent upon the state of the financial markets at such time as we
may seek to raise funds. The state of the capital markets may be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, including, but
not limited to future and current impacts of global events such as wars in the Ukraine and Israel, increases in inflation and other risks
detailed in the risk factors sections detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer, who is also our chief financial officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation
of these controls and procedures as provided under the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013), our chief executive officer/ chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Many of these deficiencies stem from a lack of adequate personnel, including individuals
with experience in financial reporting. Management has identified corrective actions for the weakness and will periodically reevaluate
our ability to add personnel and implement improved review procedures as they can be supported by the growth in our business. 

Changes
in internal controls. 

During
the quarterly period covered by this report, no changes occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CERTIFICATION
OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER 

 AND
PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT 

I,

1.
I have reviewed this quarterly report of QHSLab, Inc.; 

2.
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
