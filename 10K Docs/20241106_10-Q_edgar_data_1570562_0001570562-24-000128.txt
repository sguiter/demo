 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding future events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, our plans and expectations regarding regulatory approval, our industry and the regulatory environment in which we operate. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of those terms, or other comparable terms intended to identify statements about the future. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections, which we believe to be reasonable, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to, those made below under Summary of Risk Factors and in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the additional risks described in other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in the future, including subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which may from time to time amend, supplement or supersede the risks and uncertainties we disclose. We also operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. 
 In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such results will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other documents we file with the SEC with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by the cautionary statements referenced above. 
 Summary of Risk Factors 
 An investment in our securities involves various risks and you are urged to carefully consider the risks discussed under Item 1A Risk Factors, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q prior to making an investment in our securities. If any of the risks below or in Item 1A Risk Factors occurs, our business could be materially and adversely affected. As more fully described in Item 1A Risk Factors , the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 We currently depend entirely on the successful marketing of our only commercial product, Jeuveau . If we are unable to continue to successfully market and sell Jeuveau , we may not generate sufficient revenue to continue our business. 
 We have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have only one approved product, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability. 
 We are reliant on Symatese to achieve regulatory approval for the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid product line in the United States. Failure to obtain approval or obtain approval on our estimated time frame for the Evolysse product line would negatively affect our ability to sell these products. 
 We may require additional financing to fund our future operations or execute corporate development activities, which could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, and a failure to obtain additional capital when so needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our operations.

Table of Contents 

 If we or our counterparties do not comply with the terms of our settlement agreements with Medytox, Inc. Medytox ), we may face litigation or lose our ability to market and sell Jeuveau , which would materially and adversely affect our ability to carry out our business and our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The terms of the Settlement Agreement with Medytox will continue to reduce our profitability until the royalty payment obligations expire. 
 Our business, financial condition and operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by a public health crisis or contagious disease outbreak. 
 We rely on the license and supply agreement, as amended, with Daewoong, which we refer to as the Daewoong Agreement, to provide us with exclusive rights to distribute Jeuveau in certain territories. Any termination or loss of significant rights, including exclusivity, under the Daewoong Agreement would materially and adversely affect our development and commercialization of Jeuveau . 
 Our failure to successfully in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow our business. 
 Jeuveau faces, and any of our future product candidates will face, significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from maintaining our market share and expansion. 
 Jeuveau may fail to continue to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioners adoption and use or consumer demand necessary for commercial success. 
 Our ability to market Jeuveau is limited to use for the treatment of glabellar lines, and if we want to expand the indications for which we market Jeuveau , we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which will be expensive and may not be granted. 
 Third party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and interrupt our supply of products. 
 If we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong, are unable to maintain, obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to Jeuveau or any of our future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. 
 We may need to increase the size of our organization, including our sales and marketing capabilities, in order to further market and sell Jeuveau and to commercialize any product candidates, if approved, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. 
 We rely on our digital technology and applications and our business and operations could suffer in the event of information system failures or a cybersecurity incident. 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation, and we may face delays in or not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and our compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements may result in significant additional expense, limit or delay regulatory approval or subject us to penalties if we fail to comply. 
 We currently rely solely on Daewoong to manufacture Jeuveau and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse and as such, any production or other problems with either licensor could adversely affect us. 
 Future sales of our common stock by us or others, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. 
 Additional Information 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms Evolus, company, we, us and our refer to Evolus, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our subsidiaries taken as a whole, unless otherwise noted.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an income tax expense of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s ETR differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily as a result of the impact of the change of the valuation allowance to offset its deferred tax assets. 
 A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made. 
 Additionally, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly, the Company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
 The Company monitors changes to the tax laws in the states it conducts business and files corporate income tax returns. The Company does not expect that changes to state tax laws through September 30, 2024 to materially impact its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 The Company did not transfer any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 The Company determines the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders based on Level 3 inputs using a discounted cash flows method. The significant unobservable input assumptions that can significantly change the fair value include (i) projected amount and timing of net revenues during the payment period, which terminates at the end of the second quarter of 2029, (ii) the discount rate, and (iii) the timing of payments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a discount rate of and , respectively. Net revenue projections are also updated to reflect changes in the timing of expected sales. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate and to the projected net revenues would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, which could materially impact their fair value reported on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet.

 Legal Proceedings 
 Securities Class Action Lawsuit 
 On October 16 and 28, 2020, putative securities class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by Evolus shareholders Armin Malakouti and Clinton Cox, respectively, naming the Company and certain of its officers as defendants. The complaints assert violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, claiming that the defendants made false and materially misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts related to the Company s acquisition of the right to sell Jeuveau , the complaint against the Company filed by Allergan and Medytox in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau (the ITC Action ), and risks related to the ITC Action. The complaints assert a putative class period of February 1, 2019 to July 6, 2020. The court consolidated the actions on November 13, 2020, under the caption In re Evolus Inc. Securities Litigation , No. 1:20-cv-08647 (PGG). On September 17, 2021, the court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On November 17, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed an amended class action complaint against the Company, of its officers, and Alphaeon Corporation, the Company s former majority shareholder. On January 18, 2022, the Company and the officer defendants served their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion was fully briefed on June 16, 2022. 
 On September 26, 2024, the court granted the Company s motion to dismiss the amended complaint and provided plaintiffs with the ability to move to amend their complaint by October 17, 2024. Plaintiffs did not submit a motion to amend their complaint by October 17, 2024, and on October 18, 2024, the court entered final judgment in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs deadline to file a notice of appeal is November 18, 2024. The outcome of the legal proceeding is uncertain at this point. Based on information available to the Company at present, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss with respect to this matter. 
 Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit 
 On November 27, 2020 and December 2, 2020, putative Evolus shareholders filed substantially similar shareholder derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company s officers and directors as defendants. The complaints alleged substantially similar facts as those in the Securities Class Action and assert claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21(D) of the Exchange Act. On December 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a joint stipulation to consolidate their actions and on February 5, 2021, the court consolidated the action under the caption In re Evolus, Inc. Derivative Litigation , No. 1:20-cv-09986-PPG, and adjourned defendants time to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaints. On September 20, 2021, the court so-ordered the parties stipulated stay of the consolidated derivative suit pending the court s decision on the defendants motion to dismiss the Securities Class Action. 
 It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or additional allegations will be made by stockholders, with respect to these same or similar or other matters and also naming the Company and/or its officers and directors as defendants. The Company believes that the complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it. However, the outcome of the legal proceeding is uncertain at this point. Based on information available to the Company at present, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss with respect to this matter.

 Overview 
 We are a global performance beauty company with a customer-centric approach to delivering breakthrough products in the cash-pay aesthetic market. Our first product, Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs), is currently sold in the United States, Canada, certain European countries and Australia. We have commercial launch plans in additional countries which we expect to implement in the next few years. We are also actively pursuing regulatory approval of Evolysse , a line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels that includes mid face, nasolabial folds, lips and eyes. In October 2024, regulatory approval was received in the European Union for four products in the Evolysse line: Evolysse Form, Evolysse Smooth, Evolysse Sculpt and Evolysse Lips. In June 2024, we submitted a premarket approval PMA application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for Evolysse Form and Evolysse Smooth injectable hyaluronic acid gels for wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds. We anticipate obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States for Evolysse Form and Evolysse Smooth by September 2025. 
 
 Jeuveau is a proprietary 900 kDa purified botulinum toxin type A formulation indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines, also known as frown lines, in adults. Evolysse , a line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, is a first-generation cold technology line of hyaluronic acid gels for products including mid face, nasolabial folds, lips and eyes. Our primary market is the cash-pay aesthetic market, which consists of medical products that consumers pay for directly out of pocket. Our customers are aesthetic practitioners who are properly licensed to deliver our products. By avoiding the regulatory burdens that accompany reimbursed products and pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy, we create flexibility to deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. We utilize this flexibility to drive customer adoption through programs such as our consumer loyalty program, co-branded marketing programs, promotional events and pricing strategies. 
 Recent Developments 
 Economic Trends and Uncertainties 
 The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced volatility and disruptions, including increases in inflation rates, rising interest rates, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, and uncertainty about economic stability. We expect elevated levels of cost inflation to continue, potentially impacting consumer discretionary spending for aesthetic medical procedures. Markets experiencing uncertainty could have substantial high rates of inflation. We cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of increased inflation on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.

 Net Revenues 
 We currently operate in one reportable segment, and all of our net revenues are derived from sales of Jeuveau , our sole commercial product to date. Net revenues consist of revenues, net of adjustments primarily for customer rebates, rewards related to the consumer loyalty program and co-branded marketing programs. Revenues are recognized when the control of

Table of Contents 

 the promised goods is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration allocated to the related performance obligations and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services. 
 Net revenues of Jeuveau sales increased by 11.1 million, or 22.2 , to 61.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 50.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Net revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of 0.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of service revenue from the sale of Jeuveau through a distribution partner in Canada. We anticipate our continued sales growth will depend on our ability to successfully continue to penetrate the market, grow our customer base and increase purchases by our current customers in the competitive medical aesthetic market, as well as on obtaining regulatory approval for the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid gel line in the United States by Symatese and subsequent successful commercial launch of these products. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Product Cost of Sales 
 Product cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, primarily consisted of the cost of inventory purchased from Daewoong and our royalty obligations to Medytox at a mid-single digit percentage of net revenue through the expiration of our Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032. 
 Product cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased by 2.8 million, or 18.2 , to 18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume. We anticipate that our product cost of sales will fluctuate in line with changes in revenues until the expiration of the Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032. 
 Gross Profit Margin 
 Our gross profit margin was 68.9 and 67.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit margin has been and will continue to be negatively impacted from September 2022 to September 2032 as we pay royalty obligations related to our litigation settlement agreement. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Litigation Settlement for further information. We also anticipate our gross profit margin will fluctuate as we implement various marketing programs that may affect the average selling price for Jeuveau and as we continue to expand internationally. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 9.2 million, or 21.2 , to 52.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from increasing personnel costs related to our commercial activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses may fluctuate in the future primarily due to potential changes in marketing strategies and international launches. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 0.7 million to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to our clinical operations and research and development expenses related to obtaining regulatory approvals of Evolysse in the United States and European countries. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase if and when we develop further product candidates and as we pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions for our current products. 
 Revaluation of Contingent Royalty Obligation Payable to Evolus Founders 
 The change in the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders is recorded in operating expenses in each reporting period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revaluation charges of 2.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively, were primarily driven by changes in management assumptions relating to revenue forecasts, the discount rate used and the timing of cash flows. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.2 million, or 15.4 , to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Non-Operating Expense, Net 
 Non-operating expense, net, increased by 0.3 million, or 8.6 , to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense for our term loans. Interest on our term loans is based on a variable interest rate, which we expect will continue to fluctuate with the market. See Liquidity and Capital Resources The Pharmakon Term Loans for further information. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 There was minimal income tax expense for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues of Jeuveau sales increased by 46.3 million , or 32.8 , to 187.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 141.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Net revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of 2.0 million and 2.0 million, respectively, of service revenue from the sale of Jeuveau through a distribution partner in Canada. We anticipate our continued sales growth will depend on our ability to grow our customer base and increase purchases by our current customers in the competitive medical aesthetic market as well as on regulatory approval for the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid gel line in the United States by Symatese and subsequent commercial launch of these products. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Product Cost of Sales 
 Product cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, primarily consisted of the cost of inventory purchased from Daewoong and our royalty obligations to Medytox at a mid-single digit percentage of net revenue through the expiration of our Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032. 
 Product cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased by 13.1 million, or 31.0 , to 55.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume. We anticipate that our product cost of sales will fluctuate in line with changes in revenues until the expiration of the Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032. 
 Gross Profit Margin 
 Our gross profit margin was 69.2 and 68.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit margin has been and will continue to be negatively impacted from September 2022 to September 2032 as we pay royalty obligations related to our litigation settlement agreement. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Litigation Settlement for further information. We also anticipate our gross profit margin will fluctuate as we implement various marketing programs that may affect the average selling price for Jeuveau and as we continue to expand internationally. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 25.9 million, or 21.2 , to 147.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 121.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from increasing personnel costs related to our commercial expansion. Selling, general and administrative expenses may fluctuate in the future primarily due to potential changes in marketing strategies and international launches. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 2.5 million to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to our clinical operations and research and development expenses related to obtaining regulatory approvals of Evolysse in the United States and European countries. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase if and when we develop further product candidates and as we pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions.

 In-process Research and Development 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 4.4 million of in-process research and development expense in connection with the Symatese Agreement. Refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. 
 Revaluation of Contingent Royalty Obligation Payable to Evolus Founders 
 The change in the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders is recorded in operating expenses in each reporting period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revaluation charges of 5.6 million and 5.1 million, respectively, were primarily driven by changes in management assumptions relating to revenue forecasts, the discount rate used and the timing of cash flows. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.1 million, or 2.6 , to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-Operating Expense, Net 
 Non-operating expense, net, increased by 2.5 million, or 27.2 , to 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the advancement of the 50.0 million of term loans in 2023 and higher interest expense for our term loans. Interest on our term loans is based on a variable interest rate, which we expect will continue to fluctuate with the market. See Liquidity and Capital Resources The Pharmakon Term Loans for further information. 
 Income Taxes Expense 
 There was minimal income tax expense for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents of 85.0 million, positive working capital of 89.5 million and stockholders equity of 5.9 million. 
 We began selling Jeuveau in May 2019 and have a relatively limited history of generating revenues. Since inception, we have incurred recurring net operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of 602.6 million as of September 30, 2024 as a result of ongoing efforts to develop and commercialize Jeuveau , including providing selling, general and administrative support for our operations. We had net loss of 43.6 million and 49.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had loss from operations of 32.1 million and 40.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We used net cash of 22.8 million and 34.8 million in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we increase marketing efforts for Jeuveau in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Australia and prepare to commercially launch Jeuveau in other jurisdictions where we have obtained regulatory approval pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and prepare to commercially launch Evolysse Form, Smooth, and Sculpt injectable hyaluronic acid gel line. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 The markets in which we operate are currently experiencing increased inflation. While we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented, a prolonged inflationary environment could impact consumer discretionary spending for aesthetic medical procedures, increase our cash required for operations and impact our liquidity position. 
 Follow-On Offering 
 In March 2024, we completed a follow-on offering and issued 3,554,000 shares of its common stock, at a price to the public of 14.07 per share. We received net proceeds of 46.8 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In addition, we granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to 533,100 additional shares of common stock (the option shares at the purchase price, which the underwriters 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 exercised in April 2024 with respect to 318,100 of the allotted option shares. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the option shares, after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions, was 4.2 million. 
 At-the-market Offerings of Common Stock 
 On March 8, 2023, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement and filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and corresponding prospectus with the SEC to permit sales under the ATM Sales Agreement, which registration statement became effective on June 8, 2023. We have not sold any shares under the ATM Sales Agreement. See Note 9 . Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 The Pharmakon Term Loans 
 On December 14, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with BPCR Limited Partnership, BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, and Biopharma Credit PLC (collectively, Pharmakon ). The loan agreement, as amended, provided for Pharmakon to make multiple term loans to us totaling 125.0 million Pharmakon Term Loans ). The first tranche of 75.0 million was advanced on December 29, 2021. A second tranche of 25.0 million was advanced on May 31, 2023. The final tranche of 25.0 million was advanced on December 15, 2023. We are required to pay interest only under the loan agreement until March 2026, after which we make seven equal quarterly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/12 th of the outstanding principal amount of the loan. We pay the remaining principal of the loan on the maturity date. The Pharmakon Term Loans will mature on the sixth-year anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche. The term loan bears an annual interest rate equal to the 3-month secured overnight financing rate SOFR (subject to a SOFR rate floor of 1.0 plus 8.5 per annum. The proceeds of the Pharmakon Term Loans are used to fund our general corporate and working capital requirements. 
 Contingent Royalties to Evolus Founders 
 We are obligated to make quarterly royalty payments of a low-single digit percentage of net sales of Jeuveau to the founders of Evolus Evolus Founders ). These obligations terminate at the end of the second quarter of 2029. The fair value of the obligations is valued quarterly and is referred to in our condensed consolidated financial statements as the contingent royalty obligation. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we recorded an aggregate balance of 45.0 million on our balance sheet for the future royalty payment obligation to Evolus Founders. 
 Litigation Settlement 
 In February 2021, we settled litigation claims related to a complaint against us filed by Allergan, Inc. and Allergan Limited (together, Allergan and Medytox, Inc. Medytox in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau (the ITC Action and certain related matters by entering into a Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox and Allergan, which we refer to as the U.S. Settlement Agreement, and another Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox which we refer to as the Medytox Settlement Agreement. We refer to the U.S. Settlement Agreement and the ROW Settlement Agreement collectively as the Medytox. I n the first quarter of 2023, we made a final milestone payment of 5.0 million . Going forward, from September 17, 2022 to September 16, 2032, we will pay to Medytox a quarterly, mid-single digit royalty on net sales of Jeuveau sold in other Evolus territories pursuant to the Medytox Settlement Agreement. 
 Daewoong Agreement 
 Our agreement (as amended, the Daewoong Agreement with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Daewoong ), provides us with an exclusive distribution license to Jeuveau from Daewoong for aesthetic indications in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, members of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution rights with Daewoong in Japan. The Daewoong Agreement includes certain minimum annual purchases we are required to make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in our licensed territories. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share in various jurisdictions. 
 Symatese Agreements

Table of Contents 

 In 2023, we entered into two agreements with Symatese S.A.S. and its affiliates Symatese ), which granted us exclusive rights to commercialize and distribute the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels in the United States and 50 countries in Europe for aesthetic and dermatological uses. We refer to the agreement conveying rights in the United States as the Symatese U.S. Agreement and the agreement conveying rights in Europe as the Symatese Europe Agreement. In the United States, we obtained the rights to the Evolysse products referred to as (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt; (iv) Lips; and (v) Eye and in Europe we obtained the rights to (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt; and (iv) Lips. 
 Symatese U.S. Agreement 
 The Symatese U.S. Agreement includes certain milestone payments, development cost-sharing arrangements, and minimum annual purchases we are required to make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in our licensed territory. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share. 
 Symatese Europe Agreement 
 The Symatese Europe Agreement includes certain milestone payments and minimum annual purchases we are required to make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in our licensed territory. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share. 
 Operating Leases 
 Our corporate headquarters in Newport Beach, California is under a non-cancelable operating lease, which expires on January 31, 2030 with an option to extend the term for an additional 60 months. Lease payments increase based on an annual rent escalation clause that occurs on each February 1 anniversary. 
 Current and Future Capital Requirements 
 We believe that our current capital resources, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, and existing liquidity, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months for working capital to support our daily operations and meet commitments under our contractual obligations with third parties, although we may wish to access the debt and equity markets or other sources of financing to satisfy our long-term cash requirements as further discussed below. 
 We have based our projections of capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources, which consist of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, sooner than we expect. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to, the impact of any potential disruptions to our supply chain, inflation or other economic conditions, uncertainty regarding the stability of certain financial institutions, and other long-term commitments and contingencies. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of our products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements, including our requirements beyond the next twelve months. In such case, we may be required to raise additional capital to fund future operations through the incurrence of debt, the entry into licensing or collaboration agreements with partners, sale of equity securities, grants or other sources of financing. However, there can be no assurance such financing or other alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and rising interest rates. These conditions may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the rate of revenue growth for Jeuveau in the United States and international markets where we have launched, as well as the success of planned international launches; 
 the timing of regulatory approval for the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid gel line in the United States by Symatese and our ability to successfully launch, commercialize and market these products; 
 development costs and milestone payments related to the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid gels;

 statements as well as the expenses incurred during the reporting period. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, who serve as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (b) that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risks and uncertainties discussed below update, supersede and replace the risks and uncertainties previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024, and previously disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on July 31, 2024. We do not believe any of the changes constitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such prior Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being seriously harmed in these risk factors will include harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue and future prospects. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy 
 We currently depend entirely on the successful marketing of our only commercially available product, Jeuveau . If we are unable to successfully continue to market and sell Jeuveau , we may not generate sufficient revenue to continue our business. 
 We currently have only one commercially available product, Jeuveau , and our business presently depends entirely on our ability to successfully continue to market and sell it in a timely manner. We commercially launched in the United States in May 2019 and through a distribution partner in Canada in October 2019. We commercially launched Jeuveau in select European countries in September 2022 and in Australia in July 2024, and as such, we have a limited history of generating revenue in those markets. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to generate revenue, as well as our future growth, depend entirely on the continued successful commercialization of Jeuveau . The commercial success of Jeuveau will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to successfully market and sell Jeuveau , whether alone or in collaboration with others, including our ability to hire, retain and train sales representatives in the United States. Our ability to market and sell Jeuveau is also dependent on the willingness of consumers to pay for Jeuveau relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times. Additional factors necessary for the successful commercialization of Jeuveau include the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety of Jeuveau and relative efficacy of competing products, the timing of new product introductions by our competitors, and the sales and marketing tactics of our competitors, including bundling of multiple products, in response to our launch of Jeuveau . Each of these factors may vary on a country by country basis as we expand our operations. 
 If we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant issues continuing to market and sell Jeuveau , and we may experience significant issues successfully marketing and selling any future product candidates. In addition, our experience as a commercial company is limited. Accordingly, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of Jeuveau or any future product candidates to continue our business. 
 We have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we may incur losses in the future. We have only one approved product and limited commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability. 
 We are a global performance beauty company with a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercial launch of Jeuveau , which is currently our only commercially available product. We began selling Jeuveau in the United States in May 2019 and through a distribution partner in Canada in October 2019. We began selling Jeuveau in select countries in Europe in September 2022 and in Australia in July 2024 and, as such, have a limited history of generating revenue in those markets. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or greater experience commercializing a product. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered 
 46

 by companies in the medical aesthetics field. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2012 and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we increase marketing efforts for Jeuveau in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Australia, prepare to commercially launch Jeuveau in other jurisdictions where we have obtained regulatory approval pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and prepare to commercially launch Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid product line. We recorded net losses of 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we recorded a net loss of 61.7 million and net loss of 74.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 of 602.6 million. Our ability to achieve revenue and profitability is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market and sell Jeuveau obtain regulatory approvals for the Evolysse product line in the United States and Europe and commercialize these products. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, if needed, our ability to raise capital to continue operations. 
 We are reliant on Symatese to achieve regulatory approval for the Evolysse product line in the United States. Failure to obtain approval or obtain approval on our estimated time frame for the Evolysse product line would negatively affect our ability to sell these products. 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA and European regulatory processes for medical devices such as Evolysse are complex, time-consuming and subject to numerous inherent risks. Before Evolysse can be marketed in the United States or Europe, Symatese must obtain regulatory approval for the injectable hyaluronic acid gels. We received approval for four Evolysse products in the European Union in October 2024. Regulators must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. In addition, modifications to products that are approved by regulatory agencies generally require approval. 
 We are substantially dependent on our relationship with Symatese for the regulatory approval process of the Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid product candidates in the United States. While we have agreed to share certain costs associated with the regulatory approval process to provide our experience to Symatese, Symatese is ultimately responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of the Evolysse product line. If Symatese encounters difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for these products, our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from these products could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our reliance on Symatese for the regulatory approval process exposes us to risks associated with Symatese s ability to successfully navigate the complex regulatory landscape. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In addition, if Symatese fails to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or if regulatory authorities impose new requirements, the approval process could be delayed or approvals could be denied. This may result in additional costs, reduced revenue projections, and potential harm to our business, reputation and market position. 
 We may require additional financing to fund our future operations or execute corporate development activities, which could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, and a failure to obtain additional capital when so needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our operations. 
 We have utilized substantial amounts of cash since our inception in order to conduct clinical development to support regulatory approval and launch of Jeuveau in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. We expect that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in order to continue to market and sell Jeuveau and for the clinical and regulatory development and eventual commercialization of Evolysse and any additional product candidates we may choose to pursue. While we believe that we currently have adequate capital resources, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and availability under our ATM Program, to operate our business until our business generates profits and positive cash flow, this belief is based upon certain financial assumptions including net revenue, gross margin, working capital and expense assumptions. If these assumptions are incorrect, or if we experience other risks or uncertainties set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we may require additional capital to operate our business. 
 We expect to expend resources furthering the development and continuation of our marketing programs and commercialization infrastructure in connection with commercializing Jeuveau within and outside of the United States. We have also agreed to reimburse Symatese for certain clinical trial expenses related to the Evolysse Lip and Eye products in the United States and for certain regulatory filing fees in Europe. In the long term, our expenditures will include costs associated with the continued commercialization of Jeuveau , research and development, approval and commercialization of 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 products and any of our future product candidates, including our proposed higher strength dose of Jeuveau and the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, such as research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing and supplying as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. Because the commercialization expenditures needed to meet our sales objectives are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully market and sell Jeuveau or, if approved, the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels. We may in the future, also, acquire other companies or products which may be costly and which may require additional capital to operate. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Accordingly, our actual cash needs may exceed our expectations. 
 If we were to raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or offerings of securities convertible into our equity, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of any such securities may have a preference over our common stock. Debt financing, receivables financing and royalty financing may also be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase our capital stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders ownership, and such dilution may be material. Additionally, if we raise additional capital through debt financing, we will have increased fixed or variable payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures to meet specified financial ratios, and other operational restrictions, any of which could restrict our ability to market and sell Jeuveau or any future product candidates or operate as a business and may result in liens being placed on our assets. If we were to default on any of our indebtedness, we could lose such assets. 
 In addition, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and rising interest rates. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our commercialization efforts to achieve specified minimum sales targets under the Daewoong Agreement, Symatese U.S. Agreement and the Symatese Europe Agreement, we will lose exclusivity of the license that we have been granted under those respective agreements. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we will be required to take actions to address our liquidity needs which may include the following: significantly reduce operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of or discontinue some of our development programs, commercialization efforts or other aspects of our business plan, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates and sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above. As a result, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or our ability to fund our scheduled obligations on a timely basis or at all. 
 If we or our counterparties do not comply with the terms of our settlement agreement with Medytox, we may face litigation or lose our ability to market and sell Jeuveau , which would materially and adversely affect our ability to carry out our business and our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Effective February 18, 2021, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox, which we refer to as the Medytox Settlement Agreement. 
 Under the Medytox Settlement Agreement we obtained (i) a license to commercialize, manufacture and to have manufactured for us certain products identified in the Medytox Settlement Agreements, including Jeuveau (the Licensed Products ), in the United States and other territories where we license Jeuveau , (ii) the dismissal of outstanding litigation against us, including the action filed by Allergan and Medytox in the U.S. International Trade Commission (the ITC Action ), a rescission of the related remedial orders, and the dismissal of a civil case in the Superior Court of California against us, which we refer to together with any claims (including claims brought in Korean courts) with a common nexus of fact as the Medytox Actions, and (iii) releases of claims against us for the Medytox Actions. Under the agreement, we remain obligated to pay to Medytox a mid-single digit royalty percentage on net sales of Jeuveau in the United States and all territories we have licensed outside the United States until September 16, 2032. In addition, under the Medytox Settlement Agreement we made certain representations and warranties and agreed to certain customary positive and negative covenants. 
 In the event we fail to comply with the terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods, Medytox would have the ability to terminate the Medytox Settlement Agreement and thereby cancel the licenses granted to us and re-institute litigation against us. Any litigation may result in remedies against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 compensation to third parties, any of which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from Jeuveau , to carry out our business, and to continue as a going concern. 
 Additionally, if Medytox fails to comply with the terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement and comply with the covenants and agreements under the Medytox Settlement Agreement, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from Jeuveau , to carry out our business, and to continue as a going concern. For example, as required by the Medytox Settlement Agreement, in February 2021 Medytox filed a document with the Korean court that its litigation with Daewoong would not affect our right to have Jeuveau manufactured by Daewoong or exported to us. If Medytox were to breach the Medytox Settlement Agreement and rescind this filing and the Korean court issued a ruling against Daewoong, our supply of Jeuveau could be hindered. We would also be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation in order to enforce our rights under the Medytox Settlement Agreement. 
 The terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement will reduce our profitability until the royalty obligations expire, and may affect the extent of any discounts we may offer to our customers. 
 As a result of the royalty payments that we are required to pay under the Medytox Settlement Agreement, our profitability has and will be adversely impacted for the period that we are required to pay royalties. We may be able to offset a portion of the loss of profitability by decreasing any discount to customers on Jeuveau as compared to discounts we provided to customers prior to the Medytox Settlement Agreement. If we reduce discounts for any customers, their volume of purchases may decrease which would have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We are subject to risks associated with a public health crisis or contagious disease outbreak. 
 We are subject to risks associated with public health crises or contagious disease outbreaks. For example, we experienced material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another public health crises, including any significant resurgence of COVID-19 or other future contagious disease outbreaks, could have a similar material adverse effect on our business. Financial and operational impacts that we experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and may experience as a result of future contagious disease outbreaks or other public health crises, include: 
 a decline in the rates of elective procedures; 
 difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical programs; 
 changes in the availability of our key personnel; 
 temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our business partners, customers, third-party service providers or other vendors; 
 interruptions to our supply chain and distribution channels; and 
 downstream economic effects, including disruptions capital or financial markets, increased inflation and rising interest rates. 
 Depending on the severity of the financial and operational impacts, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted. The extent to which any future public health crises may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition depends on many factors which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of any outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain or address the impact of the outbreak, the timing, distribution, and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments, United States and foreign government actions to respond to possible reductions in global economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 
 Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Because we do not expect Jeuveau for the treatment of glabellar lines or, subject to regulatory approval, the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels to be reimbursed by any government or third-party payor, our products will continue to be paid for directly by the consumer. Demand for Jeuveau and, subject to regulatory approval, the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, is accordingly tied to the discretionary spending levels of our targeted consumer population. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, instability or crises affecting banks or other financial institutions, or inflation in consumer prices, as we are currently experiencing, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a decline in the 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 discretionary spending of our target consumer population, which could lead to a weakened demand for Jeuveau , Evolysse , or any future product candidates. A severe or prolonged economic downturn may also affect our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy, instability or crises affecting banks or other financial institutions, or political disruption or geopolitical conflicts, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our products. Inflation in the markets we serve could similarly impact our revenues, as consumer spending power could decline. Any of the foregoing could harm our business. 
 In addition, our business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about the cash-pay healthcare market. For example, we believe that the number of cash-pay healthcare procedures will increase in the future. However, these trends are uncertain and limited sources exist to obtain reliable market data. Therefore, sales of Jeuveau or any of our future product candidates could differ materially from our projections if our assumptions are incorrect. 
 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The funds in our operating accounts are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest bearing and interest-bearing accounts exceeds applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks may lead to widespread demands for customer withdrawals and liquidity constraints that may result in market-wide liquidity problems, which could adversely impact our liquidity. For example, on March 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. On March 26, 2023, the assets, deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bank were acquired by First-Citizens Bank Trust Company. Although we did not have any funds in Silicon Valley Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience similar issues. 
 In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences. 
 Our products face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion. 
 Jeuveau is approved for use and Evolysse is being investigated for use in medical aesthetic market. Regulatory approval has been received for the Evolysse in the European Union in October 2024. The United States regulatory approval and commercial launch is expected by September 2025 for the first two products with subsequent regulatory approval and product launches for the remaining products in 2026 and 2027. The medical aesthetic market is highly competitive and dynamic and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Our products face, and we anticipate that our future products will face, significant competition from other facial aesthetic products, such as other injectable and topical botulinum toxins and injectable hyaluronic acid gels. Our products may also compete with unapproved and off-label treatments. Many of our potential competitors, including AbbVie Inc., which acquired Allergan, who first launched BOTOX for cosmetic uses in 2002 and has since maintained the highest market share position in the aesthetic neurotoxin market with its BOTOX product, are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial resources enabling them to, among other things, market and discount aggressively. Within the injectable hyaluronic acid market we will also face large, experienced competitors such as AbbVie and Galderma. Competitors may also have greater brand recognition for their products, larger sales forces and larger aesthetic product portfolios allowing the companies to bundle products to provide customers more choices and to further discount their products. Additionally, our competitors have greater existing market share in the medical aesthetic market and long-standing customer loyalty programs and sales contracts with large customers which creates established business and financial relationships with customers, aesthetic societies and universities. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 These competitors may also try to compete with our aesthetic products on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume customers and coupons to consumers, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complimentary products, such as injectable hyaluronic acid gels that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. These companies may also seek to compete based on their longer operating history. Larger companies may be better capitalized than us and, accordingly, are able to offer greater customer loyalty benefits to encourage repeat use of their products and finance a sustained global advertising campaign to compete with our commercialization efforts at launch. A number of our larger competitors also have access to a significant number of studies and publications that they could use to compete with us. 
 In the long term, we expect to expand our focus to the broader cash-pay healthcare market. Competitors and other parties may seek to impact regulatory approval of our future product applications through the filing of citizen petitions or other similar documents, which could require costly and time-consuming responses to the regulatory agencies. Larger competitors could seek to prevent or delay our commercialization efforts via costly litigation which can be lengthy and expensive and serve to distract our management team s attention. We could face competition from other sources as well, including academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. In addition, we are aware of other companies also developing and/or marketing products in one or more of our target markets, including competing injectable botulinum toxin type A formulations that are currently in Phase III clinical development in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines. For example, Revance Therapeutics, Inc. obtained approval for an injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin on September 8, 2022, called Daxxify and Hugel, Inc. obtained approval for its injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin on February 29, 2024. Additionally, both Galderma S.A. and Medytox, Inc. have submitted a Biologics License Application BLA to the FDA for an injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin. With the approval of Revance Therapeutic s and Hugel s BLAs and the potential approval of additional BLAs, we expect the competition in the U.S. injectable botulinum toxin market to further increase. We would face similar risks with respect to any future product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the broader cash-pay healthcare market. Successful competitors in that market have the ability to effectively discover, obtain patents, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. 
 Our strategy of competing in the aesthetic neurotoxin market is dependent on the marketing and pricing flexibility that we believe is afforded to a company with a portfolio limited to cash-pay healthcare, comprised of products and procedures that are not reimbursed by third-party payors. In the event that regulations applicable to reimbursed products are changed to apply to cash-pay healthcare products, we would no longer have this flexibility and we may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors which may have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as a result of the royalty payments that we are required to pay under the Medytox Settlement Agreement, we may not be able to discount Jeuveau to the extent that we previously provided discounts to customers without impacting our gross profit margins. If we increase prices for any customers, their volume of purchases may decrease which would have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, competitors may develop new technologies within the medical aesthetic market that may be superior in safety and efficacy to our products or offer alternatives to the use of toxins or injectable hyaluronic acid gels, including surgical and radio frequency techniques. To compete successfully in the medical aesthetic market, we will have to demonstrate that our products are at least as safe and effective as current products sold by our competitors. Competition in the medical aesthetic market could result in price-cutting and reduced profit margins, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are approved for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States. 
 Our commercial opportunity could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than Jeuveau or any other product that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for these products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, which may create additional barriers to successfully commercializing Jeuveau and any future product candidates and attracting practitioners and consumer demand.

 Our products may fail to continue to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioner adoption and use or consumer demand necessary for continued commercial success. 
 Jeuveau or, subject to regulatory approval, the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels may fail to continue to gain or gain sufficient market acceptance by aesthetic practitioners, consumers and others in the medical aesthetics community to continue to grow our net revenues. The continued commercial success of Jeuveau and any future product candidates, including a proposed higher strength dose of Jeuveau and the Evolysse line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by aesthetic practitioners for approved indications, including, in the case of Jeuveau , the treatment of glabellar lines and other aesthetic indications that we may seek to pursue. We are aware that other companies are seeking to develop alternative products and treatments, any of which could impact the demand for our products. 
 The degree and rate of practitioner adoption of Jeuveau and any product candidates depend on a number of factors, including the cost, profitability to our customers, consumer demand, characteristics and effectiveness of the product. Our success will also depend on our ability to create compelling marketing programs, training of our customers and ability to overcome any biases aesthetic practitioners or consumers may have toward the use, safety and efficacy of existing products over our products. Moreover, our competitors may utilize negative selling efforts or offer more compelling marketing or discounting programs than we are able to offer, including by bundling multiple aesthetic products to provide a more comprehensive offering than we can so long as Jeuveau remains our only commercially available product. 
 In addition, in its clinical trials, Jeuveau was clinically tested and compared to BOTOX, both of which contain a 900 kDa complex. We believe that aesthetic practitioners familiarity with the 900 kDa complex s handling, preparation and dosing will more easily facilitate incorporation of Jeuveau into their practices. However, the ease of integration of Jeuveau into an aesthetic practitioner s practice may not be as seamless as we anticipate. 
 With respect to consumer demand, the treatment of glabellar lines with Jeuveau is an elective procedure, the cost of which must be borne by the consumer, and we do not expect costs related to the treatment to be reimbursable through any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. The decision by a consumer to undergo treatment with Jeuveau for the treatment of glabellar lines or other aesthetic indications that we may pursue may be influenced by a number of factors, including the cost, efficacy, safety, perception, marketing programs for, and aesthetic practitioner recommendations of Jeuveau versus competitive products or procedures. Moreover, consumer demand may fluctuate over time as a result of consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and Jeuveau in particular, changes in demographics and social trends, rising inflation and general consumer confidence and consumer discretionary spending, which may be impacted by a public health crisis or contagious disease outbreak as well as economic and political conditions. 
 If Jeuveau , Evolysse , or any product candidates fails to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioner adoption necessary for commercial success or the requisite consumer demand, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business. 
 Our ability to market Jeuveau is limited to use for the treatment of glabellar lines, and if we want to expand the indications for which we market Jeuveau , we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which will be expensive and may not be granted. 
 We have received regulatory approval for Jeuveau in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The terms of that approval restrict our ability to market or advertise Jeuveau for other indications, which could limit aesthetic practitioner and consumer adoption. Under the U.S. Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, we may generally only market Jeuveau for approved indications. Many of our competitors have received approval of multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications for their neurotoxin products and may be able to market such products for use in a way we cannot. For example, we are aware that one of our competitors, AbbVie, has obtained and plans to obtain additional indications for its neurotoxin product within medical aesthetics and, therefore, is able to market its product across a greater number of indications than Jeuveau . If we are unable to obtain approval for indications in addition to our approval for glabellar lines, our marketing efforts for Jeuveau will be severely limited. As a result, we may not generate aesthetic practitioner and consumer demand or approval of Jeuveau . 
 We rely on our digital technology and applications and our business and operations could suffer in the event of information system failures or a cybersecurity incident.

Table of Contents 

 We are reliant on our digital technology, including our Evolus Practice App, which allows customers to open a new account, order Jeuveau , pay invoices and engage with our customer experience team and medical affairs representatives. In the event that our digital technology is unable to function in the manner it was designed or at all, we would experience difficulty processing customer orders and requests in a timely manner or at all which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The information systems underlying our digital technology may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our digital technology is unavailable when customers attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our technology as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to sell our products through a more limited sales force may be disrupted and we may not realize the efficiencies of leveraging our digital technology, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As the number of users of our digital technology continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our customers experience with our digital technology which may decrease our revenue and harm our results of operations. 
 Further, we rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other similar functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place, or they may suffer unexpected power losses or computer system or data network failures that negatively impacts the systems or solutions on which we rely. If our third-party service providers experience a security incident or other type of interruption or if an unexpected flaw or failed software update related to third-party software used in our information systems occurs, even if inadvertent, our information systems may become disabled or inaccessible and access to our data and other business information may be limited, which could materially disrupt our operations. 
 Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, including our information systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to disruption or damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cybersecurity incidents, insider threats, persons who access our information systems in an unauthorized manner, or inadvertent misconfiguration of our systems. The risk of a security incident or system disruption, particularly through cybersecurity incidents, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cybercriminals, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Interruptions in our operations caused by any such event could result in a material disruption of our current or future product development programs. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, government files or penalties and other harm to our business and our competitive position. Interruptions in our operations caused by any such event could also result in a material disruption in our relationship with our customers. For example, if our Evolus Practice App were rendered inoperable, we would have to process orders by telephone or otherwise which may result in slower processing times and harm to our reputation. 
 Moreover, a cybersecurity incident that affects our information systems or results in the unauthorized access to financial information, personally identifiable information (PII), customer information or data, including credit card transaction data or other sensitive information, could materially damage our reputation. In addition, such a security incident may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various international, federal and state privacy and security laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. Additionally, the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve and a number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices regarding the use, disclosure and protection of PII. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, among other things, has created new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling PII. In the event of a security incident, we would also be exposed to the risk of litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cybersecurity incidents and other related security incidents.

 Jeuveau or any future product candidates for which we seek approval as a biologic may face competition sooner than anticipated. 
 With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCI Act as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar or interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics. Under the BPCI Act, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. For example, one company has filed a Citizen Petition requesting that the FDA not apply the BPCI Act to pre-enactment BLAs. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the BPCI Act may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. 
 We believe that Jeuveau should qualify for the twelve-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any of our product candidates to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar product, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. 
 If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if customers misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, significant fines, penalties, sanctions, or product liability claims, and our image and reputation within the industry and marketplace could be harmed. 
 The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about pharmaceutical products, such as Jeuveau . In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or other similar regulatory authorities as reflected in the product s approved labeling. Customers could use Jeuveau on their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label of the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines, potentially including for the treatment of other aesthetic or therapeutic indications. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may receive warning letters from and be subject to other enforcement actions by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency EMA ), and other regulatory agencies, and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed in order to resolve FDA enforcement actions. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label use, we could be subject to the FDA prohibitions or other restrictions on the sale or marketing of our products and other operations or significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. In addition, regulatory authorities outside the United States may impose similar fines, penalties or sanctions. 
 Customers may also misuse Jeuveau or any future product we offer or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to product liability claims. If Jeuveau or any future product candidates are misused or used with improper techniques or are determined to cause or contribute to consumer harm, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance and subject us to negative publicity resulting in reduced sales of our products. Furthermore, the use of Jeuveau or any future product candidates for indications other than those cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among customers and consumers. Any of these events could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline. 
 Our products may cause serious or undesirable side effects or possess other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of approved labeling, result in post-approval regulatory

 action or in product liability lawsuits. 
 Unforeseen side effects from Jeuveau , Evolysse , or any product we may offer in the future could arise either during clinical development or after marketing such product. Undesirable side effects caused by product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities. Results of clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug or device-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
 Additionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by Jeuveau , or any of our future product candidates, after obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or other jurisdictions, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including regulatory authorities withdrawing approval or limiting the marketing of our products, requiring a recall of the product, requiring additional warnings on our product labeling or medication guides or instituting Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies REMS ). In order to mitigate these risks, regulatory authorities may require additional costly clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. As a result of any of these actions our sales of the product may decrease significantly, we may be required to expend material amounts to comply with any requirements of the regulatory authorities, we could be sued in a product liability lawsuit and held liable for harm caused to patients, and our brand and reputation may suffer. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the commercialization of Jeuveau , Evolysse , and any of our future product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted against us under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources and result in decreased demand for Jeuveau , Evolysse or any future product candidates or products we may develop, termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs, injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention, withdrawal of clinical trial participants or cancellation of clinical trials and significant costs and diversion management s time to defend the related litigation. 
 Our inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Jeuveau , Evolysse , or any future products that we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. 
 Any of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product, negatively impact our revenues and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products. The demand for our products could also be negatively impacted by any adverse effects of a competitor s product or treatment. 
 Our failure to successfully in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow our business. 
 Although most of our effort is focused on the commercialization of Jeuveau , a key element of our long-term strategy is to in-license, acquire, develop, market and commercialize a portfolio of products to serve the cash-pay aesthetic market. Jeuveau is currently our sole commercially available product and Evolysse has not yet been approved for use by the FDA. Our competitors are currently able to bundle multiple aesthetic products to provide a more comprehensive offering than we can as a single product company. Because our internal research and development capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and other companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify and select promising aesthetic product candidates and products, negotiate licensing or acquisition agreements with their current owners and finance these arrangements. 
 The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. 
 Further, any product candidates that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical or clinical testing and approval by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure during product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, any approved products that we acquire may not be manufactured or sold profitably or achieve market acceptance. 
 We may need to increase the size of our organization, including our sales and marketing capabilities, in order to further market and sell Jeuveau and to commercialize any product candidates, if approved, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 322 employees, all of whom were full-time employees. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we identify, recruit, retain, incentivize and integrate any additional employees to effectively manage any future clinical trials, manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties, and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. 
 We face risks in building and managing a sales organization whether internally or by utilizing third parties, including our ability to retain and incentivize qualified individuals, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, generate sufficient sales leads, effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team, adequately provide complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may otherwise put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines, and handle any unforeseen costs and expenses. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. 
 Due to our limited financial resources and our limited experience in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our development and strategic objectives or disrupt our operations. 
 Our business may be materially adversely affected by the impact of geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, on the global economy and capital markets. 
 U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, the conflict has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions, which could continue. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East or other such geopolitical conflicts, particularly in the regions in which we operate or seek to expand, could have a similar impact. 
 Additionally, the military conflict in Ukraine has led to the imposition of sanctions and other penalties by the U.S., EU and other countries against Russia. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions have adversely affected the global economy and financial markets and could lead to further instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds at terms favorable to us, or at all. 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 Although our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflicts, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. 
 Our international operations expose us to risks, and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 We currently have operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. International operations are subject to a number of inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including differences in demand for our products due to local requirements or preferences, the difficulty of hiring and managing employees with cultural and geographic differences and the costs of complying with differing regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may experience difficulties and increased costs due to differences in laws related to enforcing contracts, protecting intellectual property, taxes, tariffs and export regulations. The current conflict between Ukraine and Russia may also impact European economies and consumer discretionary spending negatively, and the conflict in the Middle East may have similar regional impacts. We do not have significant international operations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Palestine or the surrounding regions that have been impacted by the conflicts directly. 
 Our international operations will also subject us to risks related to multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, including the GDPR, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, immigration laws, labor laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses. Additionally, we will face heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements. These and other factors could harm our ability to gain future revenue and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation s. 
 Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in our operations. The main currencies to which we are exposed to such fluctuations are the British pound and the EU euro. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from foreign operations reported in our consolidated financial statements, and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. The cost of certain items, such as raw materials, manufacturing, employee salaries and transportation and freight, required by our operations may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. To the extent that we are required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, such as under our Symatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement, which has payments denominated in Euros, the appreciation of such currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to negatively affect our business. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key personnel, we may be unable to market and sell Jeuveau successfully, or any future products we develop. 
 Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management. We believe that our future success is highly dependent upon the contributions of our senior management, particularly David Moatazedi, our President, Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Directors, Sandra Beaver, our Chief Financial Officer, Rui Avelar, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of R D, and Tomoko Yamagishi-Dressler, our Chief Marketing Officer, as well as other members of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of Jeuveau , Evolysse or any future products we develop. 
 In addition, we could experience difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceuticals and medical aesthetic field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own their research output.

 Our strategy of focusing exclusively on the cash-pay healthcare market may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability. 
 Our strategy is to focus exclusively on the cash-pay healthcare market. This focus may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability. For example, to maintain our business model, we have chosen not to offer products or services available in the broader healthcare market that are reimbursed by third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid or commercial insurance. This eliminates our ability to offer a substantial number of products and indications for Jeuveau or any future products, such as Evolysse . 
 For example, under the Daewoong Agreement our rights to market and sell Jeuveau are limited to cosmetic indications and under the Symatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement our rights are limited to aesthetic and dermatologic uses. Daewoong has subsequently licensed the rights to the therapeutic indications for Jeuveau to a third party. As a result, we do not have the ability to expand the permitted uses of our products for therapeutic indications. Jeuveau is the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication, although other companies may seek to develop a similar product in the future. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy allows for meaningful strategic advantages in the United States, including pricing and marketing flexibility. However, customers may choose to not pass any cost benefits received by them due to such pricing flexibility to their patients. In addition, companies offering aesthetic products competitive to Jeuveau , whether they pursue an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy or not, may nonetheless try to compete with Jeuveau on price both directly through rebates, promotional programs and coupons and indirectly through attractive product bundling and customer loyalty programs. Our business, financial results and future prospects will be materially harmed if we cannot generate sufficient consumer demand for Jeuveau . 
 Our business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturer and supplier must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business. 
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities in the future may, and our licensors manufacturing and supplying activities presently do, involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including botulinum toxin type A, a key component of Jeuveau , and other hazardous compounds. We and our licensors are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our licensors facilities pending their use and disposal. We and our licensors cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of any of our licensors manufacturing processes, our commercialization efforts, business operations and environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our licensors for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, this may not eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. 
 We may use third-party collaborators to help us develop, validate or commercialize any new products, and our ability to commercialize such products could be impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful. 
 We may license or selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development, validation and commercialization of Jeuveau , Evolysse , and any future product candidates. In any third-party collaboration, we would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development, validation and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also impair our reputation or result in development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses. 
 In addition, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to consumers, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. 
 We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
 We have incurred substantial losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code ), if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50 change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards NOLs ), and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. As of December 31, 2023, we had 317.7 million of federal NOLs and 227.3 million of state NOLs available to offset our future taxable income, if any. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of 2.9 million. These federal and state NOLs and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2034. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. 
 Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and limit our cash available to fund our growth strategy. 
 The Pharmakon Term Loans have, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a variable rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current variable rate indebtedness (even though the amount borrowed remains the same) and on any debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes and materially and adversely affect our profitability, cash flows and results of operations. 
 On May 9, 2023, we and Pharmakon entered into the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement. Among other changes, the Third Amendment implements the transition from a London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR based interest rate to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR based interest rate. SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates. It is possible that SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. It is possible that the volatility of and uncertainty around SOFR as a LIBOR replacement rate and the applicable credit adjustment would result in higher borrowing costs for us, and could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which may negatively impact our financial results. 
 Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Licensors 
 We rely on the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement and the Symatese Europe Agreement and any termination or loss of significant rights, including exclusivity, under these agreements would materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Our ability to exclusively commercialize Jeuveau and Evolysse are completely dependent on the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement, respectively. Under each agreement we have numerous 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 obligations, including minimum product purchases, milestone payments and commercialization and development obligations. If we breach any material obligation, our partners may terminate or decrease our rights under the agreements. If we were to lose rights under the Daewoong Agreement, or either of the Symatese Agreements, we would experience an immediate reduction in our revenues and future business opportunities. We believe it would be difficult to find an alternative supplier of these products. In addition, to the extent the alternative supplier has not secured regulatory approvals in a jurisdiction, we would have to expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approvals that may never be obtained or require several years to obtain, which could significantly delay commercialization. We may be unable to raise additional capital to fund our operations during this extended time on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, if we experience delays as a result of a dispute with either of our partners the demand for our products could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We currently rely solely on Daewoong to manufacture Jeuveau and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse and as such, any production or other problems with either licensor could adversely affect us. 
 We depend solely upon Daewoong for the manufacturing of Jeuveau and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse . Although alternative sources of supply may exist, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for and qualify alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Suppliers of any new product candidate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing the product candidate. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us. 
 In addition, our reliance on Daewoong and Symatese entails additional risks, including reliance on our partners for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possible breach of either the Daewoong Agreement by Daewoong or the Symatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement by Symatese, and the possible termination or nonrenewal of either agreement at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Our failure, or the failure of our partners, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. Our dependence on our partners also subjects us to all of the risks related to our partner s business, which are all generally beyond our control. Our partners ability to perform their obligations under their respective agreements is dependent on their operational and financial health, which could be negatively impacted by several factors, including changes in the economic, political and legislative conditions in their home countries and the broader region in general and the ability of our partners to continue to successfully attract customers and compete in its market. 
 Additionally, we are dependent on our licensors for day-to-day compliance with current good manufacturing practice cGMP for production of our products. Facilities used by our licensors to produce the drug substance, devices and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection and be approved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. If the safety of our products is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result. In addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our product into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency approval requirements, taxes, tariffs, local import requirements such as import duties or inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging. Any of these factors could adversely impact our ability to effectively market and sell our products. 
 Any failure or refusal by our licensors or any other third party to supply our products that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts. 
 Moreover, our licensors developed the manufacturing process for our products in facilities outside the United States. If these facilities were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate or comply with regulatory requirements, whether due to earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, public health emergencies, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages or otherwise, or if operations at the facility is disrupted for any other reason, such an event could jeopardize our licensors ability to manufacture our products as promptly as we or our customers expect or possibly at all. If our licensors are unable to manufacture our products within a timeframe that meets our and our customers expectations, our business, prospects, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed. Any disaster recovery and business continuity plans that we and our licensors may have in place or put in place may not be adequate in the event of a 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of our or our licensors lack of disaster recovery and business continuity plans, or the adequacy thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We forecast the demand for commercial quantities of our products, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, we may experience delays in shipments, increased inventory costs or inventory levels, and reduced cash flow. 
 We purchase our products from our licensors, Daewoong and, subject to regulatory approval, Symatese. Pursuant to our agreements with our licensors, we are obligated to submit forecasts of anticipated product orders and may, from time to time, submit purchase orders on the basis of these forecasting requirements. For a variety of reasons we may not be able to accurately predict future demand. In addition, we expect our licensors to manufacture our products for other markets in which we do not have exclusive rights. If our business significantly expands, our demand for commercial products would increase and our licensors may be unable to meet our increased demand. In addition, our products have fixed future expiration dates. If we overestimate demand for our products, we will have excess inventory, which may have to be disposed of if such inventory exceeds approved expiration dates, which would result in lost revenues and increase our expenses. If we underestimate requirements for our products, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay or prevent delivery of our products to our customers. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and interrupt our supply of products. 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the proprietary rights of third parties. Competitors in the field of dermatology, medical aesthetic and neurotoxins have developed large portfolios of patents and patent applications in fields relating to our business. In particular, there are patents held by third parties that relate to the treatment with neurotoxin-based products for the indication we are currently marketing. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the technology, medical device and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter-party reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing Jeuveau . As the technology, medical device and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. 
 Third parties may assert that we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong, are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of Jeuveau or any future product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that Jeuveau or any future product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of Jeuveau or any future product candidates, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 In addition to claims of patent infringement, third parties may bring claims against us asserting misappropriation of proprietary technology or other information in the development, manufacture and commercialization of Jeuveau or any of our future product candidates. Defense of such a claim would require dedicated time and resources, which time and resources could otherwise be used by us toward the maintenance of our own intellectual property and the development and commercialization of Jeuveau and any of our future product candidates or by any of our current or future licensors for operational upkeep and manufacturing of our products. For example, prior to entering into the Medytox Settlement Agreement, we were a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Medytox in the Superior Court of the State of California (the Medytox Litigation ), and a respondent in the ITC Action, each alleging, among other things, that Daewoong stole Medytox s botulinum toxin bacterial BTX strain, that Daewoong misappropriated certain trade secrets of Medytox, including the process used to manufacture Jeuveau (which Medytox claims is similar to its biopharmaceutical drug, Meditoxin) using the BTX strain, and that Daewoong thereby interfered with Medytox s plan to license Meditoxin to us. 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 Each of the Medytox Litigation and the ITC Action diverted the attention of our senior management and were costly, in terms of legal costs and the ultimate payments and royalties to be paid under the Medytox Settlement Agreement. 
 Additionally, we are aware that multiple entrants into the injectable hyaluronic acid market have faced litigation related to allegations of intellectual property infringement and have either expended large amounts of money to defend these claims, attempted to invalidate a third-party s intellectual property as a defense, or have entered into settlement and license agreements in order to commercialize their injectable hyaluronic acid products. As the importer of record and commercial distributor of Evolysse , we may be required to defend these cases, which may result in increased legal costs and royalty costs. 
 Parties making claims against us or any of our current or future licensors may request and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we or any of our current or future licensors may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may not be commercially or more available, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products or manufacturing processes, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical trial supplies or allow commercialization of our products or any future product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. Similarly, third-party patents could exist that might be enforced against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties. 
 If we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong and Symatese, are unable to maintain, obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our products, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. 
 We and our current licensors, Daewoong and Symatese, currently rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and proprietary know-how. Botulinum toxin cannot be patented, as it is produced by Clostridium botulinum , a gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. Only the manufacturing process for botulinum toxin can be patented, for which Daewoong has obtained a U.S. patent. Our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information and those of our licensors could be disclosed or competitors could otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we or any of our current or future licensors may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our or their intellectual property both in the United States and internationally. If we or any of our current or future licensors are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our products to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could adversely affect our business. 
 In addition to the protection afforded by trademarks, confidentiality agreements and proprietary know-how, we may in the future rely upon in-licensed patents for any future product offerings. The strength of patents we may in-license in the technology and healthcare fields involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we may in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover any of our future product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries, and the issued patents that we may in-license may be declared invalid or unenforceable. 
 We are reliant on the ability of our licensors, to maintain their intellectual property and protect their intellectual property against misappropriation, infringement or other violation. We may not have primary control over our future licensors patent prosecution activities. Furthermore, we may not be allowed to comment on prosecution strategies, and patent applications may be abandoned by the patent owner without our knowledge or consent. With respect to patents that are issued to our licensors, or patents that may be issued on patent applications, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. As a licensee, we are reliant on Daewoong, Symatese, and our future licensors to defend any third-party claims. Our licensors may not defend or prosecute such actions as vigorously or in the manner that we would have if entitled to do so, and we will be subject to any judgment or settlement resulting from such actions. Also, a third-party may challenge the validity of our in-licensing transactions. Furthermore, even 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 if they are unchallenged, any of our future in-licensed patents and patent applications may not adequately protect the licensors or our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around their or our claims. 
 We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property or the patents and other intellectual property of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming. 
 Competitors may infringe our intellectual property, including any future patents we may acquire, or the patents and other intellectual property of our licensors, including Daewoong or Symatese. As a result, we or any of our current or future licensors may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or any of our current or future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied. 
 An adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of such patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Interference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to any of our future patent applications or those of our licensors or collaborators. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us or any of our current or future licensors may fail or may be invoked against us or our licensors by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management or the management of any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong or Symatese. We may not be able, alone or with any of our current or future licensors or collaborators, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. 
 Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceedings. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed. 
 Most of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other product candidates. There could also be public announcements of the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States and in some cases may even force us to grant a compulsory license to competitors or other third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our inventions in all countries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 
 In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in domestic and foreign intellectual property laws. 
 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. 
 In addition to seeking patents for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. 
 We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We expect to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts within and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. 
 We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. 
 We employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical or medical aesthetic companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We may not be successful in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees. A loss of key personnel or their work product could diminish or prevent our ability to commercialize product candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. 
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of Evolysse or our future product candidates including certain formulations and methods of production of these products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. 
 Our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. 
 Third parties may assert that we are using trademarks or trade names that are confusingly similar to their marks. If any third party were able to establish that our trademarks or trade names were infringing their marks, that third party may be able to block our ability to use the infringing trademark or trade name. In addition, if a third party were to bring such a claim, we 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 would be required to dedicate time and resources to fight the claim, which time and resources could otherwise be used toward the maintenance of our own intellectual property. 
 Parties making claims against us may request and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could prevent our ability to use the subject trademarks or trade names. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement. We may be required to re-brand one or more of our products, product candidates, or services offered under the infringing trademark or trade name, which may require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Third parties could claim senior rights in marks which might be enforced against our use of trademarks or trade names, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales under those trademarks or trade names. 
 Risks Related to Government Regulation 
 Our business and products are subject to extensive government regulation. 
 We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, the EU, Canada, Australia and other countries, principally by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. Our partners Daewoong and Symatese are also subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and their own country s regulatory authorities as well as other regulatory authorities. Our failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, or our partner s failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Controlled Substances Act, may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other enforcement or administrative actions, including, sanctions, warnings, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Following regulatory approval, we, and our direct and indirect suppliers, including Daewoong and Symatese, remain subject to the periodic inspection of our plants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in requirements that we implement REMS programs, requirements that we complete government mandated clinical trials, and government enforcement actions including those relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing manufacturing controls. 
 If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. 
 We may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of any of our current and future product candidates. 
 The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug and biologic products, such as our neurotoxin product, and medical devices, such as our Evolysse injectable hyaluronic acid product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. If we, our products or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: 
 impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses; 
 issue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available; 
 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to aesthetic practitioners; 
 require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; 
 commence criminal investigations and prosecutions; 
 impose injunctions; 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 impose other civil or criminal penalties; 
 suspend any ongoing clinical trials; 
 delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us; 
 refuse to permit drugs or active ingredients to be imported or exported; 
 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or 
 seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall. 
 Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business and reputation. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other similar foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we and our collaborators believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. Administering product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA, the EMA or other similar regulatory authorities delaying or denying approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications. 
 Regulatory approval of a BLA or BLA supplement, PMA, marketing authorization application MAA ), or other product approval is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense expended, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon, modify or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including the following: 
 a product candidate may not be deemed safe, effective, pure or potent; 
 the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be deemed sufficient; 
 the FDA or other regulatory authorities might not approve our third-party manufacturers processes or facilities; 
 deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling, or specifications of a product candidate or in response to citizen petitions or similar documents filed in connection with the product candidate; 
 general requirements intended to address risks associated with a class of drugs, such as a new REMS requirement for neurotoxins, injectable hyaluronic acid gels or other aesthetic products; 
 the enactment of new laws or promulgation of new regulations that change the approval requirements; or 
 the FDA or other regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations. 
 If any future product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or do not gain approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed. 
 We are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, limit or delay regulatory approval and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Jeuveau and, subject to regulatory approval in the United States, Evolysse and any other products that are approved in the future, are subject to continual regulatory review by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approvals that we or our collaborators receive for any future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 efficacy of the product. In addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for Jeuveau and any other future product candidates, such as Evolysse , will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP requirements and compliance with good clinical practice GCP requirements, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with Jeuveau or any future product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials; refusal by the FDA, the EMA or other similar regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 Our ongoing regulatory requirements may also change from time to time, potentially harming or making costlier our commercialization efforts. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. 
 If we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for Jeuveau or any future product candidates, we will be unable to market our products outside of the United States. 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in markets outside of the United States. 
 Jeuveau or any future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business. 
 Some participants in our clinical trials have reported adverse events after being treated with Jeuveau . As we commercialize Jeuveau or any other product candidate, including Evolysse , the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events that we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA, the EMA or other similar regulatory authorities could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products. 
 We may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties. 
 While we do not expect that Jeuveau or Evolysse will subject us to the various U.S. federal and most state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse, we may in the future become subject to such laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 private payors. Violations of anti-kickback and other applicable laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties. 
 The federal False Claims Act FCA ), imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The FCA includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. Some state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA, apply to items or services regardless of whether the good or service was reimbursed by a government program, so called all-payor laws. These all-payor laws could apply to our sales and marketing activities even if the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA laws are inapplicable. 
 If our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate anti-kickback or related laws, including the FCA or an all-payor law, then we could be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 State and federal authorities have aggressively targeted pharmaceutical companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements with pharmacies and other healthcare providers that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines, have been ordered to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have in many cases become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business, among other consequences. Additionally, federal and state regulators have brought criminal actions against individual employees responsible for alleged violations. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. 
 Also, the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 Legislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States and other countries may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained. 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress or other countries that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future product candidates. Such changes could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing or marketing methods, changes to product labeling or promotional materials, recall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and additional recordkeeping. 
 Each of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 Securities class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our officers and directors, which could result in substantial costs and could divert management attention. 
 As disclosed in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit and we are a nominal defendant in derivative lawsuits filed against certain of our officers and directors. We maintain director and officer s insurance coverage and continue to engage in vigorous defense of such litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of such litigation, we could be forced to make significant payments to or other settlements with our stockholders and their lawyers outside of our insurance coverage, and such payments or settlement arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We may also be the target of this type of litigation in the future, as companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities act litigation. Even if the claims asserted in these lawsuits are not successful, the litigation could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 The trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses. 
 Our stock price is volatile. For example, the closing price of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 has ranged from a low of 9.99 to a high of 17.49. The stock market in general and the market for earlier stage pharmaceutical and medical aesthetic companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: 
 changes in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance; 
 the public s reaction to our earnings releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 
 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 
 any termination or loss of rights under the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement or the Symatese Europe Agreement; 
 adverse developments in the regulatory approval process for Evolysse 
 the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory or legal actions or changes affecting us or our industry; 
 adverse developments concerning our manufacturer or any future strategic partnerships; 
 adverse developments affecting our compliance with the Medytox Settlement Agreement; 
 adverse developments concerning litigation pending against us; 
 introductions and announcements of new technologies and products by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions and announcements; 
 success or failure of competitive products or medical aesthetic products generally; 
 announcements of results of clinical trials or regulatory approval or disapproval of product candidates; 
 unanticipated safety concerns related to the use of Jeuveau or any of our future products; 
 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, new product approvals and introductions, joint ventures or capital commitments;

 overall financial market conditions for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors and issuance of securities analysts reports or recommendations; 
 rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
 short selling of our common stock or the publication of opinions regarding our business prospects in a manner that is designed to create negative market momentum; 
 sales of substantial amounts of our stock by Medytox and Daewoong or other significant stockholders or our insiders, or the expectation that such sales might occur; 
 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in medical aesthetics market or the pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical industry; 
 operating and stock performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us and overall performance of the equity markets; 
 additions or departures of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Marketing Officer; 
 intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us, our manufacturer or other parties on which we rely or litigation against our general industry; 
 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities and the incurrence of additional debt; 
 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; 
 economic conditions in the markets in which we operate; and 
 other factors described in this Risk Factors section. 
 In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical aesthetics companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources from our business. 
 Future sales of our common stock by us or others, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. 
 Sales by us of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. 
 Additionally, the shares of common stock held by Medytox are subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that, subject to certain limited exceptions such as transfers to affiliates prohibit Medytox from transferring more than 75 of the shares it holds prior to September 16, 2025, with such contractual restrictions terminating on September 16, 2025. Subject to the restrictions described above, the sale by Medytox or Daewoong of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. 
 We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC covering shares of our common stock available for future issuance under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan and 2023 Inducement Incentive Plan and may file future registration statements covering shares of our common stock for future issuance under any future plans. Upon effectiveness of such registration statements, any shares subsequently issued under such plans will be eligible for sale in the public market, except to the extent that they are restricted by the contractual arrangements discussed above and subject to compliance with Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates. We have also filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the offering and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock and certain other securities, which we used to complete our March 2024 follow-on offering as well as to register the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program. Sales of a large 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 number of the shares issued under these plans in the public market, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, could discourage a takeover. 
 Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover and might make it more difficult for an investor to acquire a substantial block of our common stock. These include the following provisions: 
 permit our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a hostile bidder significantly; 
 provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors and that a director may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of our voting stock; 
 provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 
 divide our Board of Directors into three classes, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors; 
 require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent; 
 provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder s notice, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; 
 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and 
 provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or by our Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration by our company of a take-over proposal or to take certain corporate actions, including the removal of directors. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder who owns in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change-of-control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us. 
 Our certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for all internal corporate claims. Internal corporate claims are 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer or stockholder in such capacity, or as to which Title 8 of the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court of Chancery ), in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For example, this choice of forum provision would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation. The choice of forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. 
 This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we can indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Separate indemnity agreements have been issued with each director and executive officer. 
 In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers, among other things provide that: 
 We have indemnified our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that we may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interest and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful. 
 We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law. 
 We will be required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. 
 The rights conferred in our bylaws will not be exclusive. We may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents. 
 As a result, claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities. 
 Stockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our Board of Directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our Board of Directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our Board of Directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. 
 If securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about our business or decrease the frequency or cease to provide coverage of our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the equity research analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. 
 We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. 
 We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and the payment of dividends is also restricted under our credit facility. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. 
 The requirements of being a public company has and may continue to strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified Board members. 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly since we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, or a smaller reporting company as defined by the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to assist us in complying with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. 
 In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a 
 73 

Table of Contents 

 diversion of our management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.
