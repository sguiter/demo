 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Our revenue arrangements with a client may include combinations of more than one service offering which may be executed at the same time, or within close proximity of one another. We combine contracts with the same customer into a single contract for accounting purposes when the contract is entered into at or near the same time and the contracts are negotiated together. For contracts that contain more than one separately identifiable performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to the identified performance obligations based upon the relative stand-alone selling prices of the performance obligations. The stand-alone selling prices are based on an observable price for services sold to other comparable customers, when available, or an estimated selling price using a cost-plus margin or residual approach. We estimate the amount of total contract consideration we expect to receive for variable arrangements based on the most likely amount we expect to earn from the arrangement based on the expected quantities of services we expect to provide and the contractual pricing based on those quantities. We only include some or a portion of variable consideration in the transaction price when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We consider the sensitivity of the estimate, our relationship and experience with the client and variable services being performed, the range of possible revenue amounts and the magnitude of the variable consideration to the overall arrangement. The majority of our revenue arrangements are for a twelve-month period but we also have multi-year arrangements. Our revenue arrangements do not contain any significant financing element due to the contract terms and the timing between when consideration is received and when the service is provided. We typically bill customers annually or quarterly in advance of services but may also bill monthly. 

Our arrangements with customers consist principally of four different types of arrangements: 1) subscription-based service agreements; 2) one-time specified services performed at a single point in time; 3) fixed, non-subscription service agreements; and 4) unit-priced service agreements. 

Subscription-based services - Services that are provided under subscription-based service agreements represent a single promise to stand ready to provide reporting, tools and services throughout the subscription period as requested by the customer. These agreements are renewable at the option of the customer at the completion of the initial contract term for an agreed upon price increase each year. These agreements represent a series of distinct monthly services that are substantially the same, with the same pattern of transfer to the customer as the customer receives and consumes the benefits throughout the contract period. Accordingly, subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription period. 

One-time services These agreements typically require us to perform a specific one-time service in a particular month. We are entitled to a fixed payment upon completion of the service. Under these arrangements, we recognize revenue at the point in time we complete the service and it is accepted by the customer. 

Fixed, non-subscription services These arrangements typically require us to perform an unspecified amount of services for a fixed price during a fixed period of time. Revenues are recognized over time based upon the costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated contract costs. In determining cost estimates, management uses historical and forecasted cost information which is based on estimated volumes, external and internal costs and other factors necessary in estimating the total costs over the term of the contract. Changes in estimates are accounted for using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which could impact the amount and timing of revenue for any period. 

Unit-price services These arrangements typically require us to perform certain services on a periodic basis as requested by the customer for a per-unit amount which is typically billed in the months following the performance of the service. Revenue under these arrangements is recognized over the time the services are performed at the per-unit amount. 

Revenue is presented net of any sales tax charged to our clients that we are required to remit to taxing authorities. We recognize contract assets or unbilled receivables related to revenue recognized for services completed but not invoiced to the clients. Unbilled receivables are classified as receivables when we have an unconditional right to contract consideration. A contract liability is recognized as deferred revenue when we invoice clients in advance of performing the related services under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when we have satisfied the related performance obligation. 

and in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We deferred incremental costs of obtaining a contract of and in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred contract costs, net of accumulated amortization was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total amortization by expense classification for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Our contingent consideration liability relates to potential future payments to the former owners of Nobl Health Nobl which was acquired in the third quarter of 2024 (See Note 2). The potential future payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain customer contract metrics. Contingent consideration was recognized at the date of acquisition and is remeasured at each reporting date at its estimated fair value. The remeasured fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates and uses significant unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs. We measured fair value using a discounted cash flow model based on the present value of expected future payments, which considers the likelihood of meeting contract thresholds at future payment dates. Significant increases or decreases to any of the inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability. The change to the contingent consideration liability from the acquisition date, at each reporting date and the final amount paid, which is capped at million, will be recognized in earnings. We recorded an increase of to the fair value of contingent consideration, from at the acquisition date to at September 30, 2024, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Our long-term debt described in Note 4 is recorded at historical cost. The fair value of fixed rate long-term debt in 2023 was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and was estimated based primarily on estimated current rates available for debt of the same remaining duration and adjusted for nonperformance and credit. The fair value of our variable rate long-term debt is believed to approximate the carrying value because we believe the current rate reasonably estimates the current market rate for our debt. 

The following are the carrying amount and estimated fair values of long-term debt: 

Estimated fair value of long-term debt 

The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, line of credit, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value. All non-financial assets that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which includes ROU assets, property and equipment, goodwill, intangibles and cost method investments, are measured at fair value in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no indication of impairment related to these assets. 

Annually, we consider whether the recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired. However, goodwill and intangibles must be tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred triggering event ). 

million, subject to certain adjustments. We acquired Nobl to expand our portfolio of solutions and further support our experience partners in gathering real time employee and patient feedback. The Stock Purchase Agreement included a contingent consideration arrangement which requires payment of up to million undiscounted to former owners of Nobl if recurring contract value exceeds million. The amount is measured in December and June through June 2026 and paid in the following month. The potential undiscounted amount of all future contingent consideration payments that we may be required to pay ranges from to million. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of was estimated by using a discounted cash flow model. Contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period through settlement with the change recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses (See Note 1). 

Total consideration paid for Nobl is as follows: 

Estimated fair value of Contingent Consideration 

Fair value of total consideration transferred 

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired were determined based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including third-party valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. These values are preliminary, pending final measurement of tax accounts, current liabilities and goodwill. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Customer related and developed technology intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of and years, respectively and a total weighted average of years. The goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill related to the acquisition was primarily attributable to anticipated synergies and economies of scale expected from combining Nobl s operations with ours, and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition. 

In process research and development IPR D consists of Nobl s development activities related to a significant upgrade to Nobl s proprietary platform. Once the project is completed, the carrying value of the IPR D will be reclassified to software and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. 

The financial results associated with the Nobl assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, although the amounts are insignificant for 2024. Pro-forma information has not been presented because the amounts for 2024 are insignificant. Acquisition-related costs of are included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.

We have elected to apply the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Total remaining contract revenue for contracts with original duration of greater than one year expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at September 30, 2024 approximated million, of which million, million, million, million, million and are expected to be recognized during 2024 , 2025 , 2026 , 2027 , 2028 and 2029 , respectively. 

. The effective tax rate for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased to from for the same period in 2023. The change in the nine-month periods was mainly due to decreased tax benefits of from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and higher state income taxes of approximately which fluctuate based on various apportionment factors and rates for the states in which we operate. 

Delayed Draw Term Loan 

Less: current portion

Notes payable, net of current portion 

Our amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with First National Bank of Omaha FNB includes (i) a million revolving credit facility (the Line of Credit ), (ii) a million term loan (the Term Loan and (iii) a million delayed draw-down term facility (the Delayed Draw Term Loan and, together with the Line of Credit and the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ). We may use the Delayed Draw Term Loan through May 2026 to fund dividends, any permitted future business acquisitions, capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock. The Line of Credit is available to fund ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. 

Our Credit Facilities were amended on August 5, 2024, which (i) extended the maturity of the Line of Credit, (ii) extended the commitment date until which FNB will make loans available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, (iii) revised the payments on the current balances of the Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan and any future balances on the Delayed Draw Term Loan to monthly installments amortized over ten-year periods, (iv) revised the interest rate on the Term Loan from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), (v) extended the use of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to include dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions and capital expenditures and (vi) increased the allowable building renovations excluded from the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. 

Borrowings under the Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan and Line of Credit, if any, accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the SOFR plus basis points at September 30, 2024), which is payable monthly. 

Principal payments on our amended Term Loan are due in monthly installments of through May 2027 and a ballon payment for the remaining balance of million is due May 28, 2027.

We are obligated to pay ongoing unused commitment fees quarterly in arrears at a rate of per annum based on the actual daily unused portions of the Line of Credit and the Delayed Draw Term Loan facility. 

The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, subject to permitted liens and other agreed exceptions, and contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including financial covenants) and events of default. The negative covenants include, among other things, restrictions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, repurchases of our common stock and acquisitions, subject in each case to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x for all testing periods throughout the term(s) of the Credit Facilities, which calculation excludes, unless our liquidity falls below a specified threshold, (i) any cash dividend in a fiscal quarter that, together with all other cash dividends paid or declared during such fiscal quarter, exceeds million in total cash dividends paid or declared, (ii) the portion of the purchase price for any permitted share repurchase of our shares paid with cash on hand, (iii) the portion of any acquisition consideration for a permitted acquisition paid with cash on hand, and (iv) up to million of costs associated with our building renovation from or after January 1, 2023. We are also required to maintain a cash flow leverage ratio of x or less for all testing periods throughout the term(s) of the Credit Facilities. All obligations under the Credit Facilities are to be guaranteed by each of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, if any, and, to the extent required by the Credit Agreement, direct and indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. 

shares of our common stock. The 2004 Director Plan provides for grants of nonqualified stock options to each of our directors who we do not employ. On the date of each annual meeting of shareholders, options to purchase shares of common stock equal to an aggregate grant date fair value of are granted to each non-employee director that is elected or retained as a director at each such meeting. Stock options vest approximately one year following the date of grant and option terms are generally the earlier of ten years following the date of grant, or three years from the termination of the non-employee director s service. 

Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan ), as amended, provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and other share-based awards and benefits up to an aggregate of shares of our common stock. Stock options granted may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options to purchase shares of common stock are typically granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. We do, in certain limited situations, grant options with exercise prices that exceed the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. 

Performance-Based Stock Option Awards 

We grant stock options to selected executives with vesting contingent upon meeting certain Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals for options issued in 2024 are based on reaching a total recurring contract value target, measured at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2026. Vesting is also dependent upon remaining in our employment through the performance period. The performance awards issued in 2024 have a six -year contractual term. We recognize compensation expense prospectively from the date it is deemed probable that the performance goal will be met through the end of the performance period. We did not recognize compensation expense related to performance-based awards in 2024 since achieving the performance goals was not deemed probable. We granted performance-based stock option awards during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. No performance-based stock options were awarded in 2023. 

The fair value of performance-based stock options granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

Expected stock price volatility 

Risk-free interest rate 

Expected life of options (in years) 

The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected volatility was based on historical monthly price changes of our stock based on the expected life of the options at the date of grant. The expected life of options is the average number of years we estimate that options will be outstanding. We consider groups of associates that have similar historical exercise behavior separately for valuation purposes.

Service-Based Stock Option Awards 

We also grant stock options to directors and selected executives with vesting based on specified service periods. Vesting terms vary with each grant and option awards are generally five to ten years following the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period specified in the award. We granted and service-based stock option awards during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The fair value of service-based stock options granted in 2024 was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

Expected stock price volatility 

Risk-free interest rate 

Expected life of options (in years) 

The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance-based and service-based stock option awards was approximately million which was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 

Non-vested Stock Awards 

No non-vested shares of common stock were granted under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion of our results of operations and financial conditions should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Our purpose is to humanize healthcare and support organizations in their understanding of each unique individual. Our commitment to Human Understanding helps leading healthcare systems get to know each person they serve not as point-in-time insights, but as an ongoing relationship. Our end-to-end solutions enable our clients to understand what matters most to each person they serve before, during, after, and beyond clinical encounters to gain a longitudinal understanding of how life and health intersect, with the goal of developing lasting, trusting relationships. Our ability to measure what matters most and systematically capture, analyze, and deliver insights based on self-reported information from patients, families, and consumers is critical in today s healthcare market. We believe access to and analysis of our extensive consumer-driven information is increasingly valuable as healthcare providers need to better understand and engage the people they serve to create long-term relationships and build loyalty. 

Our portfolio of subscription-based solutions provides actionable information and analysis to healthcare organizations across a range of mission-critical, constituent-related elements, including patient experience, service recovery, care transitions, employee engagement, reputation management, and brand loyalty. We partner with clients across the continuum of healthcare services and believe this cross-continuum positioning is a unique and an increasingly important capability as evolving payment models drive healthcare providers and payers towards a more collaborative and integrated service model.

Revenue. Revenue in the 2024 period decreased compared to the 2023 period by 2.1 million. This was mainly from decreased US recurring revenue in our existing client base. Of this decrease, 26 was from our non-core solutions. 

Direct expenses . Variable expenses increased 452,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily from higher conference expenses partially offset by decreased data collection expenses. Variable expenses as a percentage of revenue were 18 and 16 in the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. Fixed expenses increased 220,000 primarily due to higher contracted services to support investments in our Human Understanding solutions partially offset by decreased salary and benefit costs from workforce changes and automation and state tax incentive adjustments. We have increased investments and will continue to invest in providing innovative AI solutions to our clients. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to decreased marketing expenses of 890,000, less web hosting and other software services of 204,000, decreased legal fees of 142,000 and less consulting fees of 141,000 partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs of 669,000 from investments in strategic leadership, product development and sales teams. We expect these investment levels to continue with the goal of driving efficiencies and savings in overall costs. 

Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 9,000 due to less building, furniture and computer equipment depreciation partially offset by increased software investment amortization and intangible amortization from the Nobl acquisition. 

Operating income and margin . Operating income and margin decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to the decline in revenue. 

Total other income (expense ). Total other expense increased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to lower interest income of 222,000 from decreased money market funds investments and higher interest expense of 546,000 mainly from borrowings on our Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loan, as well as the increased interest rate on our Term Loan. Other expense is expected to increase in future periods due to additional borrowings on our Delayed Draw Term Loan and the August 2024 amendment to our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity of our debt and revised the interest rate on our Term Note to SOFR plus 2.35 . 

Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate . Provision for income taxes decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to decreased taxable income. The effective tax rate remained consistent between periods.

Revenue. Revenue in the 2024 period decreased compared to the 2023 period by 4.4 million. This was mainly from decreased US recurring revenue in our existing client base. Of this decrease, 28 was from our non-core solutions. 

Direct expenses . Variable expenses increased 494,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily from higher conference expenses partially offset by decreased data collection expenses. Variable expenses as a percentage of revenue were 16 and 15 in the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. Fixed expenses decreased 133,000 primarily due to decreased salary and benefit costs from workforce changes and automation partially offset by increased contracted services to support investments in our Human Understanding solutions. We have increased investments and will continue to invest in providing innovative AI solutions to our clients. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to decreased marketing expenses of 1.4 million, less web hosting and other software services of 217,000, lower bad debt expense of 172,000 and decreased training costs of 171,000. We increased investments in strategic leadership, product development and sales during the year. We expect these investment levels to continue with the goal of driving efficiencies and savings in overall costs. 

Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 37,000 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to increased software investment amortization and intangible amortization from the Nobl acquisition. 

Operating income and margin . Operating income and operating margin decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to the decline in revenue exceeding the decline in operating expenses. 

Total other income (expense ). Total other expense increased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to lower interest income of 676,000 from decreased money market funds investments and higher interest expense of 1.3 million mainly from borrowings on our Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loan, as well as the increased interest rate on our Term Loan. Other expense is expected to increase in future periods due to additional borrowings on our Delayed Draw Term Loan and the August 2024 amendment to our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity of our debt and revised the interest rate on our Term Note to SOFR plus 2.35 . 

Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. Provision for income taxes decreased in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily due to decreased taxable income. The effective tax rate increased mainly due to decreased tax benefits of 55,000 from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and higher state income taxes of approximately 241,000 which fluctuate based on various apportionment factors and rates for the states in which we operate. 

Recurring Contract Value . Recurring contract value declined in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the lack of growth in new contracts to replace losses. Our retention rate remained fairly consistent in comparison to prior years. Our recurring contract value metric represents the total revenue projected under all renewable contracts for their respective next annual renewal periods, assuming no upsells, downsells, price increases, or cancellations, measured as of the most recent quarter end.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our Board of Directors has established priorities for capital allocation, which prioritize funding of innovation and growth investments, including merger and acquisition activity as well as internal projects. The secondary priority is capital allocation for quarterly dividends and share repurchases. 

As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included 3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, up to 25 million of unused borrowings under our Line of Credit and an additional 39 million on our Delayed Draw Term Loan. The Delayed Draw Term Loan can only be used to fund dividends, capital expenditures, permitted future business acquisitions or repurchasing our common stock. 

Our cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation and related taxes, reserve for uncertain tax positions, change in fair value of contingent consideration and the effect of working capital changes. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to working capital changes, mainly consisting of changes in trade accounts receivable due to timing of invoicing and payments, accrued expenses, wages and bonuses mainly due to the timing of payments and changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the timing of our annual business insurance and other service agreements partially offset by changes in income taxes receivable and payable due to the timing of payments. Cash provided by operating activities was also partially offset by decreased net income net of non-cash items. 

See the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this report for the detail of our operating cash flows. 

We had a working capital deficit of 23.6 million and 11.8 million on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable and increases in the borrowings outstanding on our Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loan, accrued expenses, accounts payable, accrued wages and bonuses, deferred revenue and contingent consideration due to the acquisition. These were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses primarily due to the timing of our annual business insurance payment and other service agreements, increases in income taxes receivable due to timing of payments and decreased current portion of notes payable due to the amendment of our credit agreement . Cash and cash equivalents decreased mainly due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock for treasury and cash paid to fund the Nobl acquisition, which was also funded by borrowings on our Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loan. Accrued expenses, accounts payable and accrued wages and bonuses increased primarily due to the timing of payments. Trade accounts receivable decreased due to timing of billing and collections, as well as decreases in our overall recurring contract value. Our working capital is significantly impacted by our large deferred revenue balances which will vary based on the timing and frequency of billings on annual agreements. Notwithstanding our working capital deficit on September 30, 2024, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowing availability, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our projected capital and debt maturity needs for the foreseeable future. 

Cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of payments for the acquisition of Nobl Health and purchases of property and equipment including computer software and hardware, building improvements, and furniture and equipment. 

Cash used in financing activities consisted of payments for borrowings under the Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan, Line of Credit and finance lease obligations. We also used cash to repurchase shares of our common stock for treasury, to pay dividends on common stock and for payment of payroll tax withholdings on options exercised. This was partially offset by cash provided from borrowings on the Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Down Term loan. 

Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations: 

Cash dividends of 8.6 million were paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Dividends of 2.8 million were declared in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and paid in October 2024. The dividends were paid from cash on hand and borrowings on our Line of Credit. Our board of directors considers whether to declare a dividend and the amount of any dividends declared on a quarterly basis. 

We paid cash of 11.0 million for capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenditures consisted mainly of computer software development for our Human Understanding solutions and building renovations to our headquarters. We estimate future costs related to our headquarters building renovations to be 2.5 million in 2024 and 4.7 million in 2025, which we expect to fund through operating cash flows and borrowings on the Line of Credit or Delayed Draw Term Loan.

We may use the Delayed Draw Term Loan through May 2026 to fund dividends, any permitted future business acquisitions, capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock. The Line of Credit is available to fund ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. 

Our Credit Facilities were amended on August 5, 2024, which (i) extended the maturity of the Line of Credit, (ii) extended the commitment date until which FNB will make loans available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, (iii) revised the payments on the current balances of the Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan and any future balances on the Delayed Draw Term Loan to monthly installments amortized over ten-year periods, (iv) revised the interest rate on the Term Loan from a 5 fixed rate to a floating rate based on the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), (v) extended the use of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to include dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions, and capital expenditures and (vi) increased the allowable building renovations excluded from the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.

Principal amounts outstanding under the Line of Credit are due and payable in full at maturity, in May 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.0 million of borrowings outstanding and the availability to borrow 25.0 million on the Line of Credit. The weighted average borrowings on the Line of Credit for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 8.0 million and 543,000, respectively. The weighted average borrowings on the Line of Credit for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 9.0 million and 183,000, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings on the Line of Credit during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.65 and 7.68 , respectively. The weighted average interest on borrowings on the Line of Credit during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 7.67 and 7.68 , respectively. 

We are obligated to pay ongoing unused commitment fees quarterly in arrears at a rate of 0.20 per annum based on the actual daily unused portions of the Line of Credit and the Delayed Draw Term Loan facility. 

The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, subject to permitted liens and other agreed exceptions, and contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including financial covenants) and events of default. The negative covenants include, among other things, restrictions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, repurchases of our common stock and acquisitions, subject in each case to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10x for all testing periods throughout the term(s) of the Credit Facilities, which calculation excludes, unless our liquidity falls below a specified threshold, (i) any cash dividend in a fiscal quarter that, together with all other cash dividends paid or declared during such fiscal quarter, exceeds 5.5 million in total cash dividends paid or declared, (ii) the portion of the purchase price for any permitted share repurchase of our shares paid with cash on hand, (iii) the portion of any acquisition consideration for a permitted acquisition paid with cash on hand, and (iv) up to 27.5 million of costs associated with our building renovation from or after January 1, 2023. We are also required to maintain a cash flow leverage ratio of 3.00x or less for all testing periods throughout the term(s) of the Credit Facilities. All obligations under the Credit Facilities are to be guaranteed by each of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, if any, and, to the extent required by the Credit Agreement, direct and indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants.

Stock Repurchase Program 

In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 2,500,000 shares of common stock (the 2022 Program ). Under the 2022 Program we are authorized to repurchase from time-to-time shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. The 2022 Program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of common stock in connection with the 2022 Program. The 2022 Program has no set expiration date. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 395,217 shares of our common stock under the 2022 Program. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining number of shares of common stock that could be purchased under the 2022 Program was 700,633 shares.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving its control objectives. 

We have confidence in our internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure procedures and controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all our control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II Other Information 

ITEM 1. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and recognizes a liability when a loss is probable and estimable. For additional information, see Note 1, under the heading Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Regardless of the final outcome, any legal proceedings, claims, inquiries and investigations, however, can impose a significant burden on management and employees, may include costly defense and settlement costs, and could cause harm to our reputation and brand, and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. 

Risk Factors 

The significant risk factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results are described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
