acres, of which approximately acres are classified
as conservation land, which precludes development. The Company has determined, based on its current projections for the development and/or
disposition of its property holdings, that the property holdings are not currently recorded in an amount in excess of proceeds that the
Company expects that it will ultimately obtain from the operation and disposition thereof. 

Inventory of land held for
sale, if any, is carried at the lower of cost or fair market value, less costs to sell, which is based on current and foreseeable
market conditions, discussions with real estate brokers and review of historical land sale activity fair value hierarchy (Levels 2
and 3). The Company has determined that none of its properties currently meet held for sale criteria. Land is currently utilized for
commercial specialty coffee farming operations which also support the Company's land development program, as well as farming
bananas, citrus and other farm products and ranching operations. Additionally, miscellaneous parcels of land have been leased or
licensed to third parties on a short term basis prior to the Lahaina wildfire, as discussed below. 

Beginning on August 8,
2023, a wildfire occurred due east of historic Lahaina town in Maui. The fire spread rapidly due to extreme wind conditions caused
in part by Hurricane Dora which traveled 800 miles offshore west of Maui. The fires caused multiple fatalities, widespread damage to
Lahaina town and the surrounding area including the Company s 19-acre Pioneer Mill site. The Company s offices and
coffee mill were located on the site as well as various other structures, including a building which was leased to an unrelated
third party and used to operate a coffee store. The Company also utilized portions of the property for short term license agreements
with third parties that generated income for the Company. Although no employees were injured in the fire, the Company s
offices and coffee store building were destroyed. Additionally, most of the personal property of the licensees and the coffee mill
was destroyed. The widespread destruction is likely to cause disruptions in the Company s development plans. The damage to the
coffee mill has disrupted operations and prevented the Company from processing and selling the 2023 and 2024 year coffee crop. It is
also likely that the fires and devastation caused thereby will adversely affect the long-term Maui economy and businesses operated
on Maui. Maui hotel occupancy and average daily rates has declined significantly during 2024 as the Lahaina wildfire continues to
disrupt tourism. Clean up of Lahaina town, including the Pioneer Mill Site, has commenced by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USACE contractors. Access to the property remains restricted, and such restrictions are expected to continue while
the clean-up of Lahaina town continues, estimated by USACE to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. The Company has initiated
claims with its insurance carriers. In October 2023, the Company received an initial, unallocated advance payment of 
from its insurance carrier. In June 2024, the Company received 
and in August 2024 received ,
both of which are recorded within insurance proceeds in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, as applicable. Although the Company currently expects that the Company s insurance coverage will
compensate the Company for the majority of its losses incurred in connection with the fire and related devastation, including the
costs of its structures and equipment lost in the fire, the loss in revenue from the lack of coffee sales, and the loss of income
from the licensees, there can be no assurances the Company will be fully compensated for such losses. The Company could experience
losses in excess of our insured limits, and further, claims for certain losses could be denied or subject to deductibles or
exclusions under our insurance policies. The Company has relocated its offices to temporary office facilities located on its lands
in Kaanapali and is in the planning stages of relocating its coffee mill to its farm in Kaanapali. Recovery efforts continue. 

The Company reviews its property
for impairment of value if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its property may not be recoverable. Such reviews
contain uncertainties due to assumptions and judgments considering certain indicators of impairment such as significant changes in asset
usage, significant deterioration in the surrounding economy or environmental problems. 

Provisions for impairment losses
related to long-lived assets, if any, are recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets.
If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related long-lived assets in relation to the
future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations or anticipated sales proceeds. The Company adjusts the net book value of property
to fair value if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. Assets held for sale
are recorded at the lower of the carrying value of the asset or fair value less costs to sell. 

As a result of the fires, the
Company performed an impairment evaluation of its asset groups to determine if provisions for impairment losses should be recognized.
Based on the evaluation and continued monitoring, the Company concluded a provision for impairment should not be recognized for the current
period. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the indicators for evidence of impairment in future periods. There can be no
assurance that future impairment testing will not indicate that impairment has occurred and that a provision for impairment will be required. 

that is considered to be a fair value hierarchy Level 1 investment. The Company s cash balances
are maintained primarily in two financial institutions. Such balances significantly exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
limits. Management does not believe the Company is exposed to significant risk of loss on cash and cash equivalents. 

The Company s revenues
that were subject to revenue recognition standards were as follows (in thousands): 

Total 
 
 -- 

The revenue recognition standards
require the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company
(i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur,
(iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as)
the Company satisfies the performance obligation. 

and , respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, recognized 
and , respectively, of lease income, substantially comprised of non-variable lease payments. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company recognized and , respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
recognized and , respectively, of lease expense, substantially comprised of non-variable lease payments. 

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-09 ASU 2023-09 ), Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency
and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU
2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. While
the Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this update will have on its consolidated financial statements,
no significant impact is anticipated. 

, depending on various factors, for off-site roadway,
sewer and electrical improvements that will also provide service to other KLMC properties. KLMC may, at its discretion, design, construct,
install, and complete all or portions of the off-site road, sewer and/or electrical improvements, in which case the developer shall pay
to KLMC the total costs thereof, less the KLMC committed amount. In relation to such sewer line improvement, KLMC entered into a contract
for , as amended, to install the sewer line. KLMC paid on the contract which has been recorded as a receivable, less KLMC s
sewer line commitment of . In accordance with the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement, the receivable accrues interest of and
is secured by the acre property. Due to the receipt of a Demand for Arbitration, discussed in Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies
as of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a credit loss reserve on its receivable with NHC based on its evaluation of the
probability of default that exists at NHC. The amount of the credit loss reserve represents the entire receivable amount and interest
incurred as of September 30, 2024. The provision for credit loss reserve is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses
in the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In conjunction with the Infrastructure
Improvement Agreement, the Company retains certain approval rights relating to the uses and designs of the site to ensure the uses and
designs are aligned with the Company's planned master development. If such uses result in a dispute with the developer of the site, development
of the site could be delayed. The 14.9 acre site is intended to be used for a critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility, assisted
living facility, and independent living facility. 

On June 3, 2024, KLMC entered into a property
sale agreement PVM Sales Agreement with an unrelated third party for the sale of several parcels of land, aggregating
approximately 241 acres (the PVM land parcels within Pu ukoli i Village Mauka located near the Kaanapali resort
area, north of Lahaina, Hawaii. 	Pursuant to the PVM Sales Agreement, the base sales price for the PVM land parcels is , and
the closing of the sale of the PVM land parcels is subject to a due diligence period of one hundred days, subject to a one-time 60-day
extension. On September 16, 2024, the developer executed the 60 day extension in accordance with the terms of the PVM Sales Agreement.
In addition, the developer has the right to terminate the PVM Sales Agreement on or before the expiration of the extended due diligence
period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance the sale of the PVM land parcels will be completed under the existing or any other terms
of the PVM Sales Agreement, if at all. 

On June 13, 2024, Pioneer Mill
Company, LLC. PMC ), entered into a property sale agreement PMC Sales Agreement with an unrelated third
party for the sale of four parcels of land, aggregating approximately 20 acres (the PMS land parcels located in Lahaina,
Hawaii. Pursuant to the PMC Sales Agreement, the sales price for the PMS land parcels is , and the closing of the sale of the PMS
land parcels is subject to the due diligence period. On August 12, 2024, pursuant to an amendment to the PMC Sales Agreement, the
due diligence period was extended to October 2, 2024. On October 2, 2024, pursuant to a Second Amendment to the PMC Sales Agreement,
the due diligence period was extended to November 1, 2024. On October 31, 2024, pursuant to a Third Amendment to the PMC Sales
Agreement, the PMC Sales Agreement was modified to extend the deadline for the Developer to deliver the Notice to Proceed to November
29, 2024. The developer has the right to terminate the PMC Sales Agreement depending on various factors. As the PMC Sales Agreement is
subject to certain conditions, there can be no assurance that the sale of the PMS land parcels will be completed under the existing or
any other terms of the PMC Sales Agreement, if at all. 

to Pension Plan participants during October 2022, thereby settling all benefit Pension Plan liabilities. The remaining assets of
the terminated Pension Plan of approximately reverted to the Company on September 15, 2023. 

On September 8, 2023, the Company
transferred which was approximately of the Pension Plan assets to a qualified replacement plan QRP ). The Company s
contribution to the QRP enabled the Company to reduce the excise tax due as a result of the Pension Plan termination from 50 to 20 of
the amount reverted to the Company. The Company paid the 20 excise tax of approximately in October 2023. In accordance with U.S.
GAAP, the amount transferred to the QRP is reflected as Retirement plan investments on the Company s consolidated balance sheet
as of September 30, 2024. Such assets are considered to be a fair value hierarchy Level 1 investment, and are maintained in a suspense
account within the QRP pending allocation to plan participants. The assets will be allocated to the participants in the QRP who were participants
in the terminated Pension Plan and the employees of certain affiliates, all of which have some degree of common ownership with the Company
and were concluded as eligible participants per the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA requirements for QRPs.
Such allocations are planned to be allocated ratably over a period not to exceed seven years to comply with regulatory requirements. On
February 26, 2024, approximately was allocated to the participants in the QRP. Approximately was allocated to participants
in the terminated Pension Plan and is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately was allocated to employees of affiliated companies and is reflected
as a distribution from accumulated earnings on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company maintains a nonqualified
deferred compensation arrangement (the "Rabbi Trust") which provides certain former directors of Amfac Hawaii, LLC (now known
as KLC Land Company, LLC, a direct subsidiary of Kaanapali Land through which the Company conducts substantially all of its operations)
and their spouses with pension benefits. The deferred compensation liability of is included in Other liabilities in the Company's
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

and , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The Company reimburses its affiliates
for general overhead expense and for direct expenses incurred on its behalf, including salaries and salary-related expenses incurred in
connection with the management of the Company's operations. Generally, the entity that employs the person providing the services receives
the reimbursement. Substantially all of such reimbursable amounts were incurred by JMB Realty Corporation or its affiliates, 900FMS, LLC,
900Work, LLC, and JMB Financial Advisors, LLC, all of which have some degree of common ownership with the Company. The total costs recorded
in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively, and and , respectively, of which was unpaid as
of September 30, 2024. 

The Company maintains a suspense
account within the QRP pending allocation to the employees of certain affiliates, all of which have some degree of common ownership with
the Company and were concluded as eligible participants per ERISA requirements for QRPs. The total allocation of , which occurred
during the first quarter of 2024, was recorded as a reduction in accumulated earnings in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30,
2024. Reference is made to Footnote 3 for discussion regarding the QRP. 

, relating to both secured and unsecured intercompany debts owed by
D/C to Kaanapali Land. 

At the time of the filing of the
bankruptcy petition, Kaanapali Land, as successor by merger to other entities, and D/C had been named as defendants in personal injury
actions allegedly based on exposure to asbestos. While there were relatively few cases that name Kaanapali Land, there were a substantial
number of cases that were pending against D/C on the U.S. mainland (primarily in California). Cases against Kaanapali Land (hereafter,
 Kaanapali Land asbestos cases were allegedly based on its prior business operations in Hawaii and cases against D/C were
allegedly based on sale of asbestos-containing products by D/C's prior distribution business operations primarily in California. Each
entity defending these cases believes that it has meritorious defenses against these actions, but can give no assurances as to the ultimate
outcome of these cases. The defense of these cases had a material adverse effect on the financial condition of D/C as it has been forced
to file a voluntary petition for liquidation as discussed above. Kaanapali Land does not believe that it has liability, directly or indirectly,
for D/C's obligations in those cases. Kaanapali Land does not presently believe that the cases in which it is named will result in any
material liability to Kaanapali Land; however, there can be no assurance in that regard. 

On January 21, 2020, certain asbestos
claimants filed a Stay Relief Motion motion to lift stay in connection with the D/C proceeding. The motion to lift stay
sought the entry of an order, among other things, modifying the automatic stay in the D/C bankruptcy to permit those claimants to prosecute
various lawsuits in state courts against D/C and to recover on any judgment or settlement solely from any available insurance coverage.
Various oppositions to the motion to lift stay were filed, and the matter was heard and taken under advisement in April 2020. On July 21,
2020, the bankruptcy court issued an order granting the motion to lift stay to permit the movants to pursue their claims and to recover
any judgment or settlement from and to the extent of any available insurance coverage of D/C only. 

Certain asbestos-related proofs
claims in the bankruptcy case were withdrawn in connection with the closing of the case. A court hearing was held on March 29, 2023
in which the court awarded the trustee s compensation and expenses and therefore D/C no longer has any assets. On June 6, 2023,
the bankruptcy trustee filed a final account and application to close the D/C bankruptcy and on June 14, 2023, the D/C bankruptcy
court closed the case and the trustee was discharged. Due to the closing of the case, the Company derecognized a related contingent liability.
The derecognition of the contingent liability is included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses and resulted
in a credit in expenses on the Company s consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
However, personal injury claimants may in the future assert asbestos-related claims against D/C. 

The Company has received notice
from Hawaii s Department of Land and Natural Resources DLNR that DLNR on a periodic basis would inspect all significant
dams and reservoirs in Hawaii, including those maintained by the Company on Maui in connection with its agricultural operations. A series
of such inspections have taken place over the period from 2006 through the most recent inspections that occurred in July 2024. To date,
the DLNR has cited certain deficiencies concerning two of the Company s reservoirs relating to dam and reservoir safety standards
established by the State of Hawaii. These deficiencies include, among other things, vegetative overgrowth, erosion of slopes, uncertainty
of inflow control, spillway capacity, and freeboard, and uncertainty of structural stability under certain loading and seismic conditions.
The Company does not expect that additional deficiencies will be cited as a result of the most recent inspection. The Company has taken
certain corrective actions, including lowering the reservoir operating level, as well as updating plans to address emergency events and
basic operations and maintenance. In 2018, the Company contracted with an engineering firm to develop plans to address certain DLNR cited
deficiencies on one of the Company s reservoirs. Remediation plans for addressing all deficiencies have been submitted to DLNR.
In 2012, the State of Hawaii issued new Hawaii Administrative Rules for Dams and Reservoirs which require dam owners to obtain from DLNR
Certificates of Impoundment permits to operate and maintain dams or reservoirs. Obtaining such permits requires owners
to completely resolve all cited deficiencies. Therefore, the process may involve further analysis of dam and reservoir safety requirements,
which will involve continuing engagement with specialized engineering consultants, and ultimately could result in significant and costly
improvements which may be material to the Company. 

The DLNR categorizes the
reservoirs as "high hazard" under State of Hawaii administrative rules and state statutes concerning dam and reservoir safety.
This classification, which bears upon government oversight and reporting requirements, may increase the cost of managing and maintaining
these reservoirs materially. The Company does not believe that this classification is warranted for either of the reservoirs and has initiated
a dialogue with DLNR in that regard. In April 2008, the Company received further correspondence from DLNR that included the assessment
by their consultants of the potential losses that result from the failure of these reservoirs. In April 2009, the Company filed a written
response to DLNR to correct certain factual errors in its report and to request further analysis on whether such "high hazard"
classifications are warranted. It is unlikely that the high hazard designation will be changed. 

On August 5, 2024, NHC
served KLMC with a Demand for Arbitration administrated by Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc. DPR ), relating to
the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement and NHC s development of the site. NHC alleges, among other things, that KLMC
wrongfully caused significant delays, increased costs and related damages to NHC with respect to NHC s planning and
construction of the infrastructure improvements required of NHC under the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement (as subsequently
amended). NHC seeks judgment for declaratory relief that the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement between NHC and KLMC is void; in
the alternative, for reformation of the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement; for award of damages in an amount to be proven at
arbitration; for attorneys fees and costs; for prejudgment and post-judgment interest on any monetary award; and for such
other and further relief as the arbitrator deems appropriate. On October 25, 2024, KLMC filed an Answering Statement to
NHC s Demand for Arbitration and KLMC s counterclaim against NHC. On November 5, 2024, DPR confirmed the assignment
of a mutually agreed upon arbitrator. A Schedule for the arbitration hearing has not been set. The pre-arbitration discovery process
is ongoing. KLMC will continue to vigorously defend. However, there can be no assurance that the eventual outcome of the arbitration
will not result in any material liability or have a material impact on business and financial results for KLMC. 

Other than as described above,
the Company is not involved in any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.
The Company and/or certain of its affiliates have been named as defendants in several pending lawsuits. While it is impossible to predict
the outcome of such routine litigation that is now pending (or threatened) and for which the potential liability is not covered by insurance,
the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate liability from any of this litigation will not materially adversely affect the Company's
consolidated results of operations or its financial condition. 

The Company often seeks
insurance recoveries under its policies for costs incurred or expected to be incurred for losses or claims under which the policies
might apply. As a result of the Lahaina wildfire, in October 2023, the Company received an initial, unallocated advance payment of
 
from its insurance carrier. In June 2024, the Company received an insurance payment of 
and in August 2024, received ,
both of which are recorded within insurance proceeds in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, as applicable. Reference is made to Note 1, Property, for further discussion regarding the Lahaina
wildfire. 

KLMC is a party to an agreement
with the State of Hawaii for the development of the Lahaina Bypass Highway. Approximately 2.4 miles of this two lane state highway have
been completed. Construction to extend the southern terminus was completed mid-2018. The northern portion of the Lahaina Bypass Highway,
which extends to KLMC s lands, is in the early stage of planning. Under certain circumstances, which have not yet occurred, KLMC
remains committed for approximately of various future costs relating to the planning and design of the uncompleted portion of the
Lahaina Bypass Highway. Under certain conditions, which have not yet been met, KLMC has agreed to contribute an amount not exceeding 
toward construction costs. Any such amount contributed would be reduced by the value of KLMC s land actually contributed to the
State for the Lahaina Bypass Highway. 

These potential commitments have
not been reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. While the completion of the Lahaina Bypass Highway
would add value to KLMC s lands north of the town of Lahaina, there can be no assurance that it will be completed or when any future
phases will be undertaken.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operation 

General 

Unless the context indicates
otherwise, references in this report to Kaanapali Land mean Kaanapali Land, LLC, and references to the Company 
mean Kaanapali Land and all of its subsidiaries and its predecessors. 

In addition to
historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations about its businesses and the markets in which
the Company operates. These statements include expectations concerning, among other things, the Company s land development
plans, strategy and initiatives, the expected outcome of the legal proceedings, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions. Such
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties or other
factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may be
affected by various factors including, without limitation, natural events, including the Lahaina wildfire discussed below, the
effect of geopolitical, economic and market conditions in Hawaii and globally, including the rate of inflation, changes to fiscal
and monetary policy, interest rate and currency fluctuations, pressure on the global banking system, competitive market conditions,
uncertainties and costs related to the imposition of conditions on receipt of governmental approvals and costs of material and
labor, actual versus projected timing of events, and the factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), this report and any other periodic
reports the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), all of which may cause such actual
results to differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this report. 

Lahaina Wildfire 

Beginning on August 8,
2023, a wildfire occurred due east of historic Lahaina town in Maui. The fire spread rapidly due to extreme wind conditions caused
in part by Hurricane Dora which traveled 800 miles offshore west of Maui. The fires caused multiple fatalities, widespread damage to
Lahaina town and the surrounding area including the Company s 19-acre Pioneer Mill site. The Company s offices and
coffee mill were located on the site as well as various other structures, including a building which was leased to an unrelated
third party and used to operate a coffee store. The Company also utilized portions of the property for short term license agreements
with third parties that generated income for the Company. Although no employees were injured in the fire, the Company s
offices and coffee store building were destroyed. Additionally, most of the personal property of the licensees and the coffee mill
was destroyed. The widespread destruction is likely to cause disruptions in the Company s development plans. The damage to the
coffee mill has disrupted operations and prevented the Company from processing and selling the 2023 and 2024 year coffee crop. It is
also likely that the fires and devastation caused thereby will adversely affect the long-term Maui economy and businesses operated
on Maui. Maui hotel occupancy and average daily rates has declined significantly during 2024 as the Lahaina wildfire continues to
disrupt tourism. Clean up of Lahaina town, including the Pioneer Mill Site, has commenced by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USACE contractors. Access to the property remains restricted, and such restrictions are expected to continue while
the clean-up of Lahaina town continues, estimated by USACE to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. The Company has initiated
claims with its insurance carriers, and in October 2023, the Company received an initial, unallocated advance payment of 1 million,
in June 2024, the Company received approximately 4.9 million, and in August 2024 received approximately 1.1 million from its
insurance carrier. Although the Company currently expects that the Company s insurance coverage will compensate the Company
for the majority of its losses incurred in connection with the fire and related 

20 

 (table of contents) 

devastation, including the costs of its structures and equipment lost in the fire, the loss in revenue from the
lack of coffee sales, and the loss of income from the licensees, there can be no assurances the Company will be fully compensated
for such losses. The Company could experience losses in excess of its insured limits, and further, claims for certain losses
could be denied or subject to deductibles or exclusions under its insurance policies. The Company has relocated its offices to
temporary office facilities located on its lands in Kaanapali and is in the planning stages of relocating its coffee mill to its
farm in Kaanapali. Recovery efforts continue. 

Inflation and Interest Rates 

High rates of inflation adversely
affect real estate development generally because of their impact on interest rates. However, high rates of inflation may permit the Company to increase the prices that it charges in connection with land sales,
subject to a slowdown in sales and increase in home construction costs and to general economic conditions affecting the real estate industry
and local market factors. 

High interest rates not only increase the cost of
borrowed funds to the Company, but can also have a significant effect on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective
purchasers. 

Water Use Permit s 

By letters dated October
28, 2022, the State of Hawaii Commission on Water Resource Management CWRM officially designated all six Aquifer System
Areas of the Lahaina Aquifer Sector, Maui, as Ground Water Management Areas, as of August 6, 2022. CWRM notified the Company that by August
5, 2023, the Company would need to apply for ground and surface water use permits to continue the Company s use of certain wells
that are integral to the Company s entire operations. The Company has submitted such applications for permits. In response to the
Company s applications for permits, the Company received letters dated July 19, 2024 from CWRM requesting additional information
for both of the Company s ground water and surface water applications. Such responses were due within 30 days of the date of the
letters. The Company obtained an extension for its responses to the letters and such responses were subsequently submitted. The permits,
when or if granted and subject to various conditions, would preserve the Company s existing water uses as of August 6, 2022.
The Company cannot provide any assurances that CWRM will approve such permit applications for the amounts of water the Company seeks or
impose conditions on such use that might affect the Company s operations. If CWRM should fail to approve the Company s water
requests or impose onerous conditions on its use, CWRM s actions could delay the Company s development in substantial and
material respects and affect the Company s operations and finances. Further, in the event permits adequate to the Company s
plans are not received timely or at all, there could be negative impacts on the west Maui real estate market as a whole and on the development
and sale of the Company s lands on the Island of Maui, thereby materially and adversely affecting the Company s operations,
land sales, land values, results, and financial position. 

By letter dated March 13,
2023, CWRM provided the Company a notice of alleged water violation covering the metering and monitoring of certain designated areas with
the Honokowai aquifer and hydrologic unit, as well as certain waste conditions CWRM allegedly observed on prior investigations of those
certain areas. The Company has engaged with CWRM to address the alleged violations and to seek clarification of the issues. While the
Company does not believe that such issues, when and if addressed by the Company will prove material in cost, there can be no assurances
of same.

Pension Plan 

Pacific Trail Holdings LLC,
the manager of the Company, adopted a plan to freeze the benefit accruals under and close participation in the Company s former
Pension Plan (the Pension Plan and terminated the Pension Plan on or about June 1, 2022. The Company paid lump sum benefits
totaling approximately 0.42 million to Pension Plan participants during October 2022, thereby settling all Pension Plan liabilities.
The remaining assets of the terminated Pension Plan of approximately 14.5 million reverted to the Company on September 15, 2023. 

The Company transferred 5 million,
which was approximately 25 of the Pension Plan assets to a qualified replacement plan QRP ). The Company s contribution
to the QRP enabled the Company to reduce the excise tax due as a result of the Pension Plan termination from 50 to 20 of the amount
reverted to the Company. Such assets are maintained in a suspense account within the QRP pending allocation to plan participants. The
assets will be allocated to the participants in the QRP who were participants in the terminated Pension Plan and the employees of certain
affiliates of the Company and were concluded as eligible participants per the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA required for QRPs. Such allocations are planned to be allocated ratably over a period not to exceed seven years to comply with regulatory
requirements. On February 26, 2024, approximately 1 million was allocated to the participants in the QRP. 

The Company paid the 20 
excise tax of approximately 2.9 million in October 2023. The funds freed up cash to better prepare the Company for tightening credit
markets and are available for, among other things, working capital requirements, including future operating expenses, the Company s
obligations for engineering, planning, regulatory and development costs, drainage and utilities, and potential environmental remediation
costs on existing properties. 

Land Development 

In September 2014, Kaanapali
Land Management Corp. KLMC ), pursuant to a property and option purchase agreement Purchase Agreement with
Newport Hospital Corporation NHC ), sold a parcel of approximately 14.9 acres in West Maui. The Purchase Agreement included
an Infrastructure Improvement Agreement (as subsequently amended) which commits KLMC to fund up to 0.6 million, depending on various
factors, for off-site roadway, sewer and electrical improvements that will also provide service to other KLMC properties. KLMC may, at
its discretion, design, construct, install, and complete all or portions of the off-site road, sewer and/or electrical improvements, in
which case the developer shall pay to KLMC the total costs thereof, less the KLMC committed amount. In relation to such sewer line improvement,
KLMC entered into a contract for 1.1 million to install the sewer line. KLMC has paid 1.1 million on the contract which has been recorded
as a receivable, less KLMC s sewer line commitment of 0.2 million. In accordance with the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement,
the receivable accrues interest of 6.5 and is secured by the 14.9 acre property. Due to the receipt of a Demand for Arbitration, discussed
below, as of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 1 million credit loss reserve on its receivable with NHC based on its evaluation
of the probability of default that exists at NHC. The amount of the credit loss reserve represents the entire receivable amount and interest
incurred as of September 30, 2024. In conjunction with the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement, the Company retains certain approval
rights relating to the uses and designs of the site to ensure the uses and designs are aligned with the Company s planned master
development. If such uses result in a dispute with the developer of the site, development of the site could be delayed. The 14.9 acre
site is intended to be used for a critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility, assisted living facility, and independent living
facility. 

22 

 (table of contents) 

On August 5, 2024, NHC
served KLMC with a Demand for Arbitration, administrated by Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc. DPR ), relating to
the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement and NHC s development of the site. NHC alleges, among other things, that KLMC
wrongfully caused significant delays, increased costs and related damages to NHC with respect to NHC s planning and
construction of the infrastructure improvements required of NHC under the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement (as subsequently
amended). NHC seeks judgment for declaratory relief that the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement between NHC and KLMC is void; in
the alternative, for reformation of the Infrastructure Improvement Agreement; for award of damages in an amount to be proven at
arbitration; for attorneys fees and costs; for prejudgment and post-judgment interest on any monetary award; and for such
other and further relief as the arbitrator deems appropriate. On October 25, 2024, KLMC filed an Answering Statement to
NHC s Demand for Arbitration and KLMC s counterclaim against NHC. On November 5, 2024, DPR confirmed the assignment of a
mutually agreed upon arbitrator. A schedule for the arbitration hearing has not been set. The pre-arbitration discovery process is
ongoing. KLMC will continue to vigorously defend. However, there can be no assurance that the eventual outcome of the arbitration
will not result in any material liability or a material impact on business and financial results for KLMC. 

 On June 3, 2024, KLMC entered into a property
sale agreement PVM Sales Agreement with an unrelated third party for the sale of several parcels of land, aggregating
approximately 241 acres (the PVM land parcels within Pu ukoli i Village Mauka located near the Kaanapali resort
area, north of Lahaina, Hawaii. 	Pursuant to the PVM Sales Agreement, the base sales price for the PVM land parcels is 29.9 million,
and the closing of the sale of the PVM land parcels is subject to the due diligence period of one hundred days, subject to a one-time
60-day extension. On September 16, 2024, the developer executed the 60 day extension in accordance with the terms of the PVM Sales
Agreement. In addition, the developer has the right to terminate the PVM Sales Agreement on or before the expiration of the extended due
diligence period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance the sale of the PVM land parcels will be completed under the existing or any
other terms of the PVM Sales Agreement, if at all. 

If the PVM Sales
Agreement is terminated prior to the closing of the sale, the Company will continue with its planning for the development of a
241-acre residential development site in the region south of Kaanapali Coffee Farms known as Puukolii Village. The conceptual master
plan is comprised of 20 developable parcels planned for 940 units including a mix of affordable and market priced homes, both single
and multi-family, mixed use commercial, parks, school, and community facilities. Puukolii Village is fully entitled. At this time,
the Company is uncertain whether the Lahaina wildfire and resulting devastation might delay approvals from the County of Maui. In
conjunction with the potential development of Puukolii Village and in coordination with the possible development by an unrelated
third party of the 14.9 acre site to be used for a critical access hospital, as noted above, the Company installed a sewer line from
the Puukolii Village site to the critical care hospital site. The developer of the critical access hospital site is obligated to
share in the sewer line cost for the portion of the sewer line fronting the critical care hospital site (see discussion above). 

On June 13, 2024, Pioneer
Mill Company, LLC. PMC ), entered into a property sale agreement PMC Sales Agreement with an unrelated third
party for the sale of four parcels of land, aggregating approximately 20 acres (the PMS land parcels located in Lahaina,
Hawaii. Pursuant to the PMC Sales Agreement, the sales price for the PMS land parcels is 20 million, and the closing of the sale of the
PMS land parcels is subject to the due diligence period. On August 12, 2024, pursuant to an amendment to the PMC Sales Agreement,
the due diligence period was extended to October 2, 2024. On October 2, 2024, pursuant to a Second Amendment to the PMC Sales
Agreement, the due diligence period was extended to November 1, 2024. On October 31, 2024, pursuant to a Third Amendment to
the PMC Sales Agreement, the PMC Sales Agreement was modified to extend the deadline for the Developer to deliver the Notice to Proceed
to November 29, 2024. The developer has the right to terminate the PMC Sales Agreement depending on various factors. As the PMC Sales
Agreement is subject to certain conditions, there can be no assurance that the sale of the PMS land parcels will be completed under the
existing or any other terms of the PMC Sales Agreement, if at all.

 (table of contents) 

The Company is in the
planning stages for the development of a 295-acre parcel in the region mauka of Kaanapali Coffee Farms KCF Mauka ).
The parcel is to be comprised of 61 agricultural lots that will be offered to individual buyers. The Company expects to develop the
parcel in phases and all phases have been submitted to the County of Maui (the County for subdivision approval. The
Company has been working with the County to resolve certain of the County s comments relating to the subdivision. The
Company s understanding is that all outstanding comments from the County have been resolved verbally with County staff. The
final approval letter is pending and additional efforts are being made to secure the approval. Upon final subdivision approval of
all phases and receipt of final plat of the first phase from the County, which requires a bond in the amount of the cost to develop
the first phase, the Company plans to pre-sell the undeveloped lots in the first phase. The Company expects to market the lots in
the first phase upon receiving final approvals from the County, subject to various contingencies, including, but not limited to,
governmental and market factors and the availability of a bond to secure the first phase of the development. At this time, the
Company is uncertain whether the Lahaina wildfire and resulting devastation may negatively impact the marketability of the lots in the
first phase of the development. Therefore, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to meet such timeline, that the
subdivision will ultimately be approved or that the lots will sell for prices deemed advantageous by the Company. 

Comparison of Results of Operations 

Reference is made to
the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items addressing comparability between
years. 

The decrease in retirement
plan investments as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, is primarily due to the QRP allocation that was made
to plan participants during the first quarter of 2024. 

The decrease in other assets
as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, is primarily due to recording a credit loss reserve related to the Demand
for Arbitration from the Newport Hospital Corporation during the second quarter of 2024. 

The increase in accounts
payable and accrued expenses at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to payables related to payroll. 

The decrease in deposits
and deferred gains as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the recognition of an insurance
advance during 2024 to purchase mill replacement equipment. 

The decrease in sales for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due
to the reduction of coffee sales as a result of the Lahaina wildfire. 

The increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 is due to the derecognition of a contingent liability related to the D/C Distribution bankruptcy case during
second quarter 2023. 

The decrease in excise tax
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023 is primarily due to the excise taxes paid on in 2023 related to the terminated Pension Plan. 

24 

 (table of contents) 

The increase in insurance
proceeds for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023
is due to the recognition of an insurance advance during the first quarter of 2024 to purchase mill replacement equipment as well as approximately
 6 million received from the Company s insurance carriers as a result of the Lahaina wildfire. 

See also the notes to
the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items addressing comparability between the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The primary business of Kaanapali
Land is the investment in and development of the Company's assets on the Island of Maui. The various development plans will take many
years at significant expense to fully implement. Proceeds from land sales are the Company's only source of significant cash proceeds and
the Company's ability to meet its liquidity needs is dependent on the timing and amount of such proceeds. 

The Company's operations
have in recent periods been primarily reliant upon the net proceeds of sales of developed and undeveloped land parcels. 

The Company had cash and
cash equivalents of approximately 25 million and 26 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which
is available for, among other things, working capital requirements, including future operating expenses, the rebuilding of the coffee
mill and replacement of equipment and structures destroyed in the Lahaina wildfire, and the Company's obligations for engineering, planning,
regulatory and development costs, drainage and utilities, environmental remediation costs on existing and former properties, potential
liabilities resulting from tax audits, and existing and possible future litigation. The Company does not anticipate making any distributions
for the foreseeable future. 

The Company s liquidity
is influenced by many factors, including the coverage and timing of insurance proceeds, the impact of the Lahaina wildfire (including
on the marketability of property), coffee sales, and completion of property sales on acceptable terms, if at all. Although the Company
believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital needs over the near term, should the Company be unable to
satisfy its liquidity requirements from its existing resources and future property sales, it will likely pursue alternate financing arrangements.
However it cannot be determined at this time what, if any, financing alternatives may be available and at what cost. 

Cash Flows 

 Net cash
flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.7 million and was due
to insurance proceeds received related to the Lahaina wildfire offset by the cost of installation of a sewer line, costs of
purchasing coffee mill replacement equipment, as well as, costs of project planning and engineering, primarily relating to KCF Mauka
and Puukollii Village Mauka. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were
approximately 0.8 million and was due to retirement plan investments allocated to participants in the QRP who are employees of
certain affiliates of the Company.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The discussion and analysis
of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these unaudited interim financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances; additionally
management evaluates these results on an on-going basis. Management's estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Different estimates could be made under different assumptions
or conditions, and in any event, actual results may differ from the estimates. The impact of a change in these estimates, assumptions,
and judgments could materially affect the amounts reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Certain accounting policies
involve significant judgments and estimates by management, and the Company considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting
policies. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting polices disclosed in 2023 Form 10-K, except as described in Note
1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
