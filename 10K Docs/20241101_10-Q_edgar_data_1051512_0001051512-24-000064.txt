 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis compares Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. s (TDS) financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. It should be read in conjunction with TDS interim consolidated financial statements and notes included herein, and with the description of TDS business, its audited consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) included in TDS Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain numbers included herein are rounded to millions for ease of presentation; however, certain calculated amounts and percentages are determined using the unrounded numbers. 
 This report contains statements that are not based on historical facts, which may be identified by words such as believes, anticipates, estimates, expects, plans, intends, projects, will and similar expressions. These statements constitute and represent forward looking statements as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 General 
 TDS is a diversified telecommunications company that provides high-quality communications services to approximately 6 million connections nationwide as of September 30, 2024. TDS provides wireless services through its 83 -owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular). TDS also provides broadband, video and voice services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TDS Telecommunications LLC (TDS Telecom). TDS operates entirely in the United States. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, TDS and UScellular modified their reporting structure due to the planned disposal of the UScellular wireless operations and, as a result, disaggregated the UScellular operations into two reportable segments - Wireless and Towers. This presentation reflects how TDS' and UScellular's chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates operating performance following this strategic shift. Prior periods have been updated to conform to the new reportable segments. See Note 14 Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about TDS' segments.

 TDS Mission and Strategy 
 TDS mission is to provide outstanding communications services to its customers and meet the needs of its shareholders, its people, and its communities. In pursuing this mission, TDS seeks to grow its businesses, create opportunities for its associates, support the communities it serves, and build value over the long term for its shareholders. Since its founding, TDS has been committed to bringing high-quality communications services to rural and underserved communities. TDS continues to make progress on developing and enhancing its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) program, including the publication of the most recent TDS ESG Report in August 2024, which is available on the TDS website. 
 TDS historical long-term strategy has been to re-invest the majority of its operating capital in its businesses to strengthen their competitive positions and financial performance, while also returning value to TDS shareholders primarily through the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend. In the second quarter of 2024, TDS reset its approach to capital allocation and declared dividends in both the second and third quarters of 2024 at approximately 20 of the first quarter of 2024 dividend for TDS Common and Series A shares. This shift in approach is expected to free up additional capital that can be used to support TDS' fiber program, among other purposes. 
 TDS plans to build shareholder value by continuing to execute on its strategies to build strong, competitive businesses providing high-quality, data-focused services and products. Strategic efforts include: 
 UScellular offers economical and competitively priced service plans and devices to its customers and is focused on increasing revenues from sales of related products such as device protection plans and from services such as fixed wireless home internet. In addition, UScellular is focused on expanding its solutions available to business and government customers. 
 UScellular continues to enhance its network capabilities, including by deploying 5G technology to help address customers growing demand for data services and create opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. In 2019-2023, UScellular focused on 5G coverage and predominantly used low-band spectrum to launch 5G services in portions of substantially all of its markets. During 2023 and 2024, UScellular has focused on deploying 5G over its mid-band spectrum, largely overlapping areas already covered with low-band 5G service to enhance speed and capacity for UScellular s mobility and fixed wireless services. Investments in the next several years are expected to be focused on continued mid-band spectrum deployment to enhance speed and capacity needs, building on the existing 5G coverage across UScellular s footprint. 
 UScellular seeks to grow revenue in its Towers segment primarily through increasing third-party colocations on existing towers through providing unique tower locations, attractive terms and streamlined implementation to third-party wireless operators. 
 TDS Telecom strives to provide high-quality broadband services in its markets with the ability to provide value-added bundling with video and voice service options. TDS Telecom focuses on driving growth by investing in fiber deployment primarily in its expansion markets and also in its incumbent and cable markets that have historically utilized copper and coaxial cable technologies. 
 TDS Telecom seeks to grow its operations by creating clusters of markets in attractive, growing locations and may seek to acquire and/or divest of assets to support its strategy. 
 Announced Transactions and Strategic Alternatives Review 
 On August 4, 2023, TDS and UScellular announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies decided to initiate a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for UScellular. On May 28, 2024, UScellular announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the execution of a Securities Purchase Agreement (Securities Purchase Agreement) by and among TDS, UScellular, T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile) and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile for a purchase price, subject to adjustment as specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement, of 4,400 million, which is payable in a combination of cash and the assumption of up to approximately 2,000 million in debt. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. The transactions are expected to close in mid-2025, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into a License Purchase Agreement (Verizon Purchase Agreement) with Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close for total proceeds of 1,000 million. As of September 30, 2024, UScellular's book value of the wireless spectrum licenses to be sold was 586 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is contingent on the closing of the T-Mobile transaction and the termination of the T-Mobile Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement. 
 
 The strategic alternatives review process is ongoing as UScellular seeks to opportunistically monetize its spectrum assets that are not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement.

 TDS incurred third-party expenses related to the announced transactions and strategic alternatives review of 11 million and 43 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 4 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Significant Financial Matter 
 Net loss attributable to TDS common shareholders was 83 million and 86 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Such net losses include a non-cash charge related to the UScellular impairment of certain wireless spectrum licenses in the amount of 136 million 102 million, net of tax impacts), which was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The conclusion that this impairment was required was made in connection with the review and preparation of the September 30, 2024 financial statements. See Note 8 Intangible Assets for a detailed discussion regarding this impairment. Refer to Supplemental Information to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD A for a reconciliation of the wireless spectrum license impairment, net of tax.

 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities represents TDS share of net income from entities in which it has a noncontrolling interest and that are accounted for using the equity method or the net asset value practical expedient. TDS investment in the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (LA Partnership) contributed pre-tax income of 16 million and 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 48 million and 52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 9 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to an increase in borrowings under the TDS term loan agreements, partially offset by a decrease in the average principal balance outstanding on the receivables securitization agreement. See Market Risk for additional information regarding maturities of long-term debt and weighted average interest rates. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to the deferred tax benefit on the impairment of certain wireless spectrum licenses recorded in the third quarter of 2024. 
 TDS calculated income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on an estimated year-to-date tax rate. The effective tax rates are expected to vary in the fourth quarter and the annual period of 2024 due primarily to fluctuations in Income before income taxes, the impairment of wireless spectrum licenses in the third quarter of 2024, and tax impacts of divestiture activities. See Note 7 Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Key components of changes in the statement of operations line items were as follows: 
 Total operating revenues 
 Retail service revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a decrease in average postpaid and prepaid connections, partially offset by an increase in Postpaid ARPU as previously discussed in the Operational Overview section. 
 Equipment sales revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decline in smartphone devices sold due to lower upgrades. 
 Equipment sales revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decline in smartphone devices sold due to lower upgrades and gross additions, partially offset by a higher average price of new smartphone sales. 
 Wireless service providers have been aggressive promotionally and on price to attract and retain customers. This includes both traditional carriers and cable wireless companies. UScellular expects promotional aggressiveness by traditional carriers to continue and pricing pressures from cable wireless companies and new entrants to increase into the foreseeable future. Additionally, other wireless service providers have more developed networks and coverage as well as lower costs per subscriber than UScellular, which has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect UScellular's ability to compete over time. Operating revenues and Operating income (loss) have been negatively impacted by these factors in current and prior periods, and are expected to be negatively impacted in future periods.

These severance expenses are included in System operations expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 System operations expenses 
 System operations expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decrease in expenses driven by the shutdown of the 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by increases in outbound roaming usage and maintenance, utilities, and cell site expenses. 
 Cost of equipment sold 
 Cost of equipment sold decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decline in smartphone devices sold due to lower upgrades.

 Key components of changes in the statement of operations line items were as follows: 
 Intra-company revenues 
 Intra-company revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in the intra-company rate charged by Towers to Wireless and an increase in the number of owned towers. 
 Upon closing of the transaction to dispose of the wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile, UScellular expects an increase in Third-party revenues that will be recognized under the Master License Agreement that will go into effect under the Securities Purchase Agreement. However, at such time Intra-company revenues would cease, resulting in significantly lower Total tower revenues in periods following the close.

 Total operating expenses 
 Total operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in System operations expenses as a result of increases in cell site ground rent and maintenance expenses. 
 Upon closing of the transaction to dispose of the wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile, UScellular expects expenses may be incurred to effect the separation including costs to decommission certain towers and record remaining ground lease obligations on such decommissioned towers. These factors and other uncertainties in how the ongoing tower operations will be supported in the long-term may significantly impact operating expenses recorded in periods following the close.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 TDS and its subsidiaries operate capital-intensive businesses. In the past, TDS existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its financing agreements, preferred share offerings, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for TDS to meet its day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. TDS has incurred negative free cash flow at times in past periods, and this could occur in future periods. 
 TDS believes that existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its financing agreements, its ability to obtain future external financing, potential dispositions and expected cash flows from operating and investing activities will provide sufficient liquidity for TDS to meet its day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements. In addition, TDS retains the ability, as described below, to reduce its capital and operating expenditures at TDS Telecom to lower its funding needs. 
 TDS may require substantial additional funding for, among other uses, capital expenditures, making additional investments including new technologies, fiber deployments and E-ACAM builds, agreements to purchase goods or services, leases, repurchases of shares, or payment of dividends. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the size of its existing credit facilities, to amend existing or put in place new credit agreements, to obtain other forms of financing, issue equity securities, or to divest assets in order to fund potential expenditures. TDS' liquidity would be adversely affected if it is unable to obtain short or long-term financing on acceptable terms. 
 TDS will continue to monitor the rapidly changing business and market conditions and is taking and intends to take appropriate actions, as necessary, to meet its liquidity needs. Due to its smaller scale, UScellular has higher costs per subscriber than its competitors and is balancing the timing of investments, such as its 5G deployment, with liquidity considerations. TDS Telecom has entered into and may continue to enter into agreements to divest of certain non-strategic assets, including in certain cases the associated E-ACAM build-out obligations, as well as slow the pace of and reprioritze its fiber deployment plans and reduce or defer planned capital expenditures as a means to lower its funding needs and meet its obligations. It is possible that TDS Telecom will be required, if it is unable to access capital on acceptable terms, to substantially reduce its plans for fiber deployment, in both the short and long-term. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market investments. The primary objective of TDS Cash and cash equivalents investment activities is to preserve principal. TDS does not have direct access to UScellular cash. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 (Dollars in millions) 

The majority of TDS Cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposit accounts and in money market funds that purchase only debt issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies. Refer to the Consolidated Cash Flow Analysis for additional information related to changes in Cash and cash equivalents.

 Consolidated Cash Flow Analysis 
 TDS operates a capital-intensive business. TDS makes substantial investments to acquire wireless spectrum licenses and to construct and upgrade communications networks and facilities with a goal of creating long-term value for shareholders. In recent years, rapid changes in technology and new opportunities have required substantial investments in potentially revenue enhancing and cost-saving upgrades to TDS networks. Revenues from certain of these investments are long-term and in some cases are uncertain. To meet its cash-flow needs, TDS may need to delay or reduce certain investments, dividend payments or sell assets. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within this MD A and Note 7 Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to seasonality, timing and other factors. The following discussion summarizes TDS' cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 2024 Commentary 
 TDS Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased 202 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 933 million due to net loss of 34 million adjusted for non-cash items of 841 million, distributions received from unconsolidated entities of 106 million, including 37 million in distributions from the LA Partnership, and changes in working capital items which increased net cash by 20 million. The working capital changes were primarily driven by reduced receivable and inventory balances, partially offset by payments of associate bonuses and agent rebates and commissions. 
 Cash flows used for investing activities were 580 million, due primarily to payments for property, plant and equipment of 655 million partially offset by proceeds received from the divestiture of the hosted and managed services (HMS) operations. See Note 7 Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Cash flows used for financing activities were 151 million, due primarily to 300 million borrowed under TDS term loan agreements, 100 million borrowed under the TDS revolving credit agreement and a 40 million borrowing under the UScellular receivables securitization agreement. These were partially offset by 200 million in repayments on the TDS revolving credit agreement, 188 million in repayments on the UScellular receivables securitization agreement, the payment of 83 million in dividends, cash paid for software license agreements of 32 million and the repurchase of 26 million of UScellular Common Shares. 
 2023 Commentary 
 TDS Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased 106 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 923 million due to net income of 16 million adjusted for non-cash items of 727 million, distributions received from unconsolidated entities of 97 million, including 37 million in distributions from the LA Partnership, and changes in working capital items which increased net cash by 83 million. The working capital changes were primarily driven by reduced inventory and receivable balances and a federal income tax refund of 57 million received during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by timing of vendor payments and payment of associate bonuses. 
 Cash flows used for investing activities were 922 million, due primarily to payments for property, plant and equipment of 906 million. 
 Cash flows used by financing activities were 107 million, due primarily to 385 million in repayments on the UScellular receivables securitization agreement, 265 million in repayments on the TDS revolving credit agreement, a 60 million repayment on the UScellular EIP receivables repurchase agreement, the payment of 114 million in dividends and cash paid for software license agreements of 29 million. These were partially offset by 300 million borrowed under the TDS secured term loan agreement, 265 million borrowed under the TDS revolving credit agreement, 115 million borrowed under the UScellular receivables securitization agreement and 100 million borrowed under the TDS export credit agreement.

 Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis 
 The following discussion addresses certain captions in the consolidated balance sheet and changes therein. This discussion is intended to highlight the significant changes and is not intended to fully reconcile the changes. Notable balance sheet changes during 2024 were as follows: 
 Inventory, net 
 Inventory, net decreased 41 million due primarily to the sell through of inventory on hand which was elevated at the end of 2023 to support holiday promotions and ensure adequate device supply. 
 Accrued compensation 
 Accrued compensation decreased 42 million due primarily to associate bonus payments in March 2024. 
 Other current liabilities 
 Other current liabilities decreased 38 million due primarily to decreases in agent rebate and commission liabilities as a result of lower sales volume and payments of Auction 107 relocation fees.

 Supplemental Information Relating to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 TDS sometimes uses information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate the performance of its business. Specifically, TDS has referred to the following measures in this report: 
 EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted OIBDA 
 Free cash flow 
 Licenses impairment, net of tax 
 
 These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rules. Following are explanations of each of these measures. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as Net income adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation below. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. TDS does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation below are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a segment measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing the segments' performance. See Note 14 Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to applicable GAAP income measures are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of TDS operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, nonrecurring expenses, gains and losses, and other items as presented below as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of TDS financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management s evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, gains and losses, and expenses related to the strategic alternatives review of UScellular, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The following tables reconcile EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measures, Net income (loss) and/or Operating income (loss). Income and expense items below Operating income (loss) are not provided at the individual segment level for UScellular Wireless and UScellular Towers; therefore, the reconciliations begin with EBITDA and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is Operating income (loss) rather than Net income (loss) at the segment level.

 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 TDS prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. TDS significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 Revenue Recognition and Note 10 Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in TDS' Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. TDS application of critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in TDS Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and updated below based on developments since the TDS Form 10-K was filed. 
 Wireless Spectrum License Impairment UScellular 
 Wireless spectrum licenses represent a significant component of TDS' consolidated assets. Wireless spectrum licenses are considered to be indefinite-lived assets, and therefore, are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are events or circumstances that cause UScellular to believe that their carrying values exceed their fair values. Wireless spectrum licenses are tested for impairment at the level of reporting referred to as a unit of accounting. 
 As a result of executing the Securities Purchase Agreement with T-Mobile during the second quarter of 2024, UScellular bifurcated its historical single unit of accounting into two units of accounting wireless spectrum licenses to be sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement and wireless spectrum licenses to be retained. During the third quarter of 2024, UScellular s efforts to monetize its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement provided new evidence that the highest and best use of the retained spectrum to current buyers would be in separate tranches. As a result, UScellular further divided its wireless spectrum licenses units of accounting from one retained unit into eleven units, resulting in twelve total units of accounting. UScellular concluded that there were events and circumstances in the third quarter of 2024 that caused UScellular to believe the carrying values of five of the units of accounting may exceed their respective fair values (i.e. triggering event), and accordingly a quantitative impairment assessment was performed for those units. There was no triggering event for the other units of accounting. 
 A market approach was used for purposes of the quantitative impairment assessment to value the wireless spectrum licenses for the five units tested, using a range of values established largely through industry benchmarks, FCC auction data, and precedent transactions. The midpoint of the range was established as the estimate of fair value for each unit of accounting. Based on this valuation, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses exceeded their respective carrying values by amounts ranging from 9 to 80 for three of the units of accounting. For two of the units of accounting, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses was less than the respective carrying value, and a million impairment was recorded to Loss on impairment of licenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within UScellular s Wireless segment during the third quarter of 2024. The impairment loss was substantially all related to the retained high-band spectrum unit of accounting which includes the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands, the carrying value of which was 161 million as of September 30, 2024 after the impairment loss. The impairment loss is driven by the change in the units of accounting described above combined with lower fair value primarily attributed to high-band spectrum as a result of industry-wide challenges encountered related to the operationalization of this spectrum.

 Announced Transactions and Strategic Alternatives Review Risk Factors 
 TDS and UScellular entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 24, 2024 with T-Mobile and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. In addition, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2024 to sell certain wireless spectrum licenses. There is no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement will be able to be consummated or that UScellular will be able to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 Operational Risk Factors 
 Intense competition involving products, services, pricing, promotions and network speed and technologies could adversely affect TDS revenues or increase its costs to compete. 
 TDS smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than TDS has caused and could continue to cause TDS to be unable to compete successfully, which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause TDS roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact TDS ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 An inability to attract diverse people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 A failure by TDS to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could put TDS at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce TDS revenues or could increase its costs of doing business. 
 Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and TDS investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that TDS expects. 
 Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of TDS businesses could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.

 A failure by TDS to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations. 
 Difficulties involving third parties with which TDS does business, including changes in TDS relationships with or financial or operational difficulties, including supply chain disruptions, of key suppliers or independent agents and third-party national retailers who market TDS services, could adversely affect TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technologies, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Financial Risk Factors 
 Uncertainty in TDS or UScellular's future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, changes in interest rates, other changes in TDS or UScellular's performance or market conditions, changes in TDS or UScellular's credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which has required and is expected in the future to require TDS to reduce or delay its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, divest assets or businesses, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases and/or the payment of common shareholder dividends. 
 TDS has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt. 
 TDS has entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement that imposes certain restrictions on its business and operations that may affect its ability to operate its business and make payments on its indebtedness. 
 TDS assets and revenue are concentrated primarily in the U.S. telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry. 
 TDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDS financial condition or results of operations. 
 Regulatory, Legal and Governance Risk Factors 
 Failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 TDS receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional or environmental studies to the effect that potentially harmful emissions from devices or network equipment, including but not limited to radio frequencies emitted by wireless signals or due to contamination from network cabling, may cause harmful health or environmental consequences, including cancer, tumors or otherwise harmful impacts, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices or frequencies used by other industries, could have an adverse effect on TDS wireless and/or wireline business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Certain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS or have other consequences. 
 General Risk Factors 
 TDS has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede TDS access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Risk Factors 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in TDS Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect TDS business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, may not be the only risks that could affect TDS. Additional unidentified or unrecognized risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect TDS business, financial condition and/or operating results. Subject to the foregoing and other than the risk factors set forth below, TDS has not identified for disclosure any material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in TDS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 TDS and UScellular entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 24, 2024 with T-Mobile and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. In addition, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2024 to sell certain wireless spectrum licenses. There is no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement will be able to be consummated or that UScellular will be able to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 On August 4, 2023, TDS and UScellular announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies decided to initiate a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for UScellular. As part of this review, on May 28, 2024, UScellular announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close. 
 The transactions resulting from the strategic alternatives review are subject to regulatory approval, which UScellular may not be able to obtain on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Similarly, UScellular may not be able to satisfy the other closing conditions applicable to each of the transactions, which in the case of the Verizon transaction include the closing of the T-Mobile transaction and the termination of the T-Mobile Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement. In addition, UScellular may be unable to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 The uncertainty regarding the transactions and continued strategic alternatives review process could result in: a diversion of management's attention from UScellular's existing business; a failure to achieve financial and operating objectives; adverse effects on UScellular's financial condition or results of operations; a failure to retain key personnel, customers, business partners or contracts; and volatility in TDS' and UScellular's stock price. 
 In addition, the strategic alternatives review process has already resulted in the incurrence of significant expense - this is expected to continue. The execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement impacted UScellular's units of accounting and asset groups for purposes of assessing wireless spectrum licenses and property, plant and equipment for impairment, but did not require an impairment assessment to be performed during the second quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, there were events and circumstances that impacted the units of accounting for purposes of assessing wireless spectrum licenses for impairment. UScellular performed a quantitative impairment assessment on certain units of accounting and recorded an impairment in the third quarter of 2024. There may be future events that could require an impairment assessment to be performed which may result in additional impairments. There can be no assurance that such comprehensive process, which is ongoing, will result in the transactions or any strategic alternative of any kind being successfully completed or that the process or any outcomes of the process will not have an adverse impact on UScellular's business or financial statements.

 TDS receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Telecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in high-cost areas. UScellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received 92 million in high-cost support for service to high-cost areas in 2023. While there is uncertainty, UScellular expects regulatory support payments to decline in future periods, and there is no assurance that UScellular will qualify for future regulatory support programs. TDS Telecom also received support under the Connect America Fund support program. The ACAM and E-ACAM programs have build-out requirements that may not be met, which would result in penalties, loss of support and/or deferral of future revenues. In 2023, TDS Telecom received 110 million under all federal regulatory support programs. There is no assurance that regulatory support payments will continue for TDS Telecom, and no assurance that TDS Telecom will qualify for future regulatory support programs. If regulatory support is discontinued or reduced from current levels, or if receipt of future regulatory support is contingent upon making certain network-related expenditures, this could have an adverse effect on TDS business, financial condition or operating results and cash flows. Adding to this uncertainty are a series of court cases challenging the constitutionality of the universal service fund program that establishes and administers these regulatory support payments. On July 24, 2024, differing from earlier decisions at the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting in en banc review ruled that the universal service fund program is unconstitutional as currently administered, and remanded the case to the FCC. The FCC has filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. In addition, a working group within Congress is considering legislative reform of the universal service funding program, but has not yet released legislative text. This ruling may have significant adverse effects on the funding that each of UScellular and TDS Telecom receives from programs like USF high-cost support and E-ACAM. Additionally, the ruling may have significant adverse effects on federal government supported programs that many of UScellular s and TDS Telecom s customers benefit from. 
 Telecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to TDS services is uncertain in many cases and periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees TDS currently pays. In some instances, TDS passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on TDS to customers. TDS may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service.

 The effective tax rate on Income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. These effective tax rates were higher than normal due primarily to the relatively low amount of Income before income taxes which increased the effective tax rate impact of recurring tax adjustments including nondeductible interest and compensation expenses, as well as discrete increases in state valuation allowances which reduced the net value of deferred tax assets.

 million, which is payable in a combination of cash and the assumption of up to approximately million in debt. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. UScellular expects to present the wireless operations and select spectrum assets sold to T-Mobile as discontinued operations if and when the accounting criteria is met. The transactions are expected to close in mid-2025, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into a License Purchase Agreement (Verizon Purchase Agreement) with Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close for total proceeds of million. As of September 30, 2024, UScellular's book value of the wireless spectrum licenses to be sold was million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is contingent on the closing of the T-Mobile transaction and the termination of the T-Mobile Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement. 
 
 The strategic alternatives review process is ongoing as UScellular seeks to opportunistically monetize its spectrum assets that are not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 
 TDS incurred third-party expenses related to the announced transactions and strategic alternatives review of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 UScellular also assessed whether the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement constituted a significant change in the way it expects to operate its long-lived assets. Specifically, given the Securities Purchase Agreement, and UScellular's plan to divest of its wireless operations, UScellular expects to generate cash flows from the wireless operations separately from the retained business. Therefore, in the second quarter of 2024, UScellular bifurcated the historical single asset group into asset groups wireless and towers. At that time, UScellular also assessed whether an impairment test of its long-lived assets was required and determined that there was no triggering event present due to the factors just described that required a recoverability test to be performed. In the third quarter of 2024, UScellular re-assessed whether an impairment test of its long-lived assets was required considering the wireless spectrum license impairment and determined that there was no triggering event that required a recoverability test to be performed. 
 As part of the transaction, UScellular entered into a Put/Call Agreement with T-Mobile whereby T-Mobile has the right to call certain spectrum assets and UScellular has the right to put certain spectrum assets to T-Mobile for an aggregate agreed upon price of million. The call option notice period started on May 24, 2024, and the put exercise period starts at the close of the broader transaction. There was no cash exchanged at the inception of the Put/Call Agreement. All license transfers pursuant to any put/call are subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval. UScellular accounts for this instrument as a net written call option and records such option at fair value each reporting period unless/until such option is exercised or terminated. UScellular estimated the fair value of the net written call option at million as of September 30, 2024, which was recorded to Other deferred liabilities and credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in fair value is recorded to (Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 TDS Telecom 
 On May 31, 2024, TDS Telecom entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell certain incumbent markets in Virginia for a purchase price of million. The assets and liabilities of the markets being sold have been classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 On August 19, 2024, TDS Telecom entered into agreements with third-parties to sell certain assets and liabilities of its cable operations in Texas for a price of million. The assets and liabilities of the operations being sold have been classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

 units of accounting wireless spectrum licenses to be sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement and wireless spectrum licenses to be retained. During the third quarter of 2024, UScellular s efforts to monetize its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement provided new evidence that the highest and best use of the retained spectrum to current buyers would be in separate tranches. As a result, UScellular further divided its wireless spectrum licenses units of accounting from one retained unit into eleven units, resulting in total units of accounting. UScellular concluded that there were events and circumstances in the third quarter of 2024 that caused UScellular to believe the carrying values of five of the units of accounting may exceed their respective fair values (i.e. triggering event), and accordingly a quantitative impairment assessment was performed for those units. There was no triggering event for the other units of accounting. 
 A market approach was used for purposes of the quantitative impairment assessment to value the wireless spectrum licenses for the five units tested, using a range of values established largely through industry benchmarks, FCC auction data, and precedent transactions. The midpoint of the range was established as the estimate of fair value for each unit of accounting. Based on this valuation, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses exceeded their respective carrying values by amounts ranging from to for three of the units of accounting. For two of the units of accounting, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses was less than the respective carrying value, and a million impairment was recorded to Loss on impairment of licenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within UScellular s Wireless segment during the third quarter of 2024. The impairment loss was substantially all related to the retained high-band spectrum unit of accounting which includes the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands, the carrying value of which was million as of September 30, 2024, after the impairment loss. The impairment loss is driven by the change in the units of accounting described above combined with lower fair value primarily attributed to high-band spectrum as a result of industry-wide challenges encountered related to the operationalization of this spectrum.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, TDS borrowed million and repaid million under its revolving credit agreement. Borrowings under the TDS revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus . As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings and the unused borrowing capacity was million. 
 Receivables Securitization Agreement 
 UScellular, through its subsidiaries, has a receivables securitization agreement that permits securitized borrowings using its equipment installment plan receivables. Amounts under the agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until September 2025. Unless the agreement is amended to extend the maturity date, repayments based on receivable collections commence in October 2025. The outstanding borrowings bear interest at a rate of the lender's cost of funds (which has historically tracked closely to SOFR) plus . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UScellular borrowed million and repaid million under its receivables securitization agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million and the unused borrowing capacity was million, subject to sufficient collateral to satisfy the asset borrowing base provisions of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the USCC Master Note Trust held million of assets available to be pledged as collateral for the receivables securitization agreement. 
 Term Loan Agreements 
 In May 2024, TDS entered into a million unsecured term loan credit agreement. At closing, million was drawn, less original issue discount, and the remaining million may be drawn until November 2025. The maturity date of the agreement is May 2029. The agreement requires TDS to make prepayments of the outstanding borrowings to the extent TDS receives cash proceeds in excess of prescribed thresholds from certain transactions as more fully described in the agreement. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus . Quarterly payments of the outstanding borrowings multiplied by were required beginning in September 2024, with the amount increasing if the remaining available capacity is drawn. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million. 
 In October 2024, UScellular repaid million under its term loan agreement due July 2026. 
 Debt Covenants 
 The TDS and UScellular revolving credit agreements, term loan agreements including the secured term loan, export credit financing agreements and the UScellular receivables securitization agreement require TDS or UScellular, as applicable, to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, which include certain financial covenants that may restrict the borrowing capacity available. TDS and UScellular are required to maintain the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter at a level not to exceed the following: to 1.00 from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025; to 1.00 from April 1, 2025 and thereafter. TDS and UScellular are also required to maintain the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio at a level not lower than to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. TDS and UScellular believe they were in compliance as of September 30, 2024 with all such financial covenants.

 UScellular formed USCC EIP LLC (Seller/Sub-Servicer), USCC Receivables Funding LLC (Transferor) and the USCC Master Note Trust (Trust), collectively the special purpose entities (SPEs), to facilitate a securitized borrowing using its equipment installment plan receivables. Under a Receivables Sale Agreement, UScellular wholly-owned, majority-owned and unconsolidated entities, collectively referred to as affiliated entities , transfer device equipment installment plan contracts to the Seller/Sub-Servicer. The Seller/Sub-Servicer aggregates device equipment installment plan contracts, and performs servicing, collection and all other administrative activities related to accounting for the equipment installment plan contracts. The Seller/Sub-Servicer sells the eligible equipment installment plan receivables to the Transferor, a bankruptcy remote entity, which subsequently sells the receivables to the Trust. The Trust, which is bankruptcy remote and isolated from the creditors of UScellular, will be responsible for issuing asset-backed variable funding notes (Notes), which are collateralized by the equipment installment plan receivables owned by the Trust. Given that UScellular has the power to direct the activities of these SPEs, and that these SPEs lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, UScellular is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the SPEs, and therefore consolidates them. All transactions with third parties (e.g., issuance of the asset-backed variable funding notes) will be accounted for as a secured borrowing due to the pledging of equipment installment plan contracts as collateral, significant continuing involvement in the transferred assets, subordinated interests of the cash flows, and continued evidence of control of the receivables. 
 The following VIEs were formed to participate in FCC auctions of wireless spectrum licenses and to fund, establish, and provide wireless service with respect to any FCC wireless spectrum licenses won in the auctions: 
 Advantage Spectrum, L.P. (Advantage Spectrum) and Sunshine Spectrum, Inc., the general partner of Advantage Spectrum; and 
 King Street Wireless, L.P. (King Street Wireless) and King Street Wireless, Inc., the general partner of King Street Wireless. 
 These particular VIEs are collectively referred to as designated entities. The power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs is shared. Specifically, the general partner of these VIEs has the exclusive right to manage, operate and control the limited partnerships and make all decisions to carry on the business of the partnerships. The general partner of each partnership needs the consent of the limited partner, an indirect TDS subsidiary, to sell or lease certain wireless spectrum licenses, to make certain large expenditures, admit other partners or liquidate the limited partnerships. Although the power to direct the activities of these VIEs is shared, TDS has the most significant level of exposure to the variability associated with the economic performance of the VIEs, indicating that TDS is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, these VIEs are consolidated into the TDS financial statements. 
 TDS also consolidates other VIEs that are limited partnerships that provide wireless service. A limited partnership is a variable interest entity unless the limited partners hold substantive participating rights or kick-out rights over the general partner. For certain limited partnerships, UScellular is the general partner and manages the operations. In these partnerships, the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights and, further, such limited partners do not have the authority to remove the general partner. Therefore, these limited partnerships also are recognized as VIEs and are consolidated into the TDS financial statements under the variable interest model.

 TDS manages the operations of and holds a variable interest in certain other limited partnerships, but is not the primary beneficiary of these entities, and therefore does not consolidate them into the TDS financial statements under the variable interest model. 
 TDS total investment in these unconsolidated entities was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in Investments in unconsolidated entities in TDS Consolidated Balance Sheet. The maximum exposure from unconsolidated VIEs is limited to the investment held by TDS in those entities. 
 Other Related Matters 
 TDS made contributions, loans or advances to its VIEs totaling million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which million in 2024 and million in 2023, are related to USCC EIP LLC as discussed above. TDS may agree to make additional capital contributions and/or advances to these or other VIEs and/or to their general partners to provide additional funding for their operations or the development of wireless spectrum licenses granted in various auctions. TDS may finance such amounts with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit or receivables securitization agreements and/or other long-term debt. There is no assurance that TDS will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all to provide such financial support. 
 The limited partnership agreement of Advantage Spectrum also provided the general partner with a put option whereby the general partner may require the limited partner, a subsidiary of UScellular, to purchase its interest in the limited partnership. The put option was not exercised during the exercise period.

 Numbers may not foot due to rounding. 
 1 Income and expense items below Operating income are not provided at the individual segment level for Wireless and Towers. These items are not included in the evaluation of operating performance of the segments, and therefore are reported for "UScellular Total". 
 2 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion (Adjusted EBITDA) is a segment measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing the segments' performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. TDS believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of TDS operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of TDS' financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. 
 3 Assets are not provided at the individual segment level for Wireless and Towers. The UScellular segments operate under a common capital structure, and management has historically considered its assets collectively as part of a combined wireless network.

 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 TDS maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to TDS management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As required by SEC Rules 13a-15(b), TDS carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of TDS disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, TDS principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that TDS' disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, TDS internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 On May 2, 2023, a putative stockholder class action was filed against TDS and UScellular and certain current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. An Amended Complaint was filed on September 1, 2023, which names TDS, UScellular, and certain current UScellular officers and directors as defendants, and alleges that certain public statements made between May 6, 2022 and November 3, 2022 (the potential class period) regarding, among other things, UScellular s business strategies to address subscriber demand, violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of stockholders who purchased TDS equity securities during the potential class period and demands unspecified monetary damages. 
 On June 18, 2024, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division against UScellular, certain TDS and UScellular directors and officers, and nominal defendant TDS. The derivative lawsuit takes issue with the same public statements made between May 6, 2022 and November 3, 2022, alleging that the fact that the statements were made was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the officer and director defendants, and bringing claims for indemnification and contribution against the officer and director defendants and UScellular. In addition to indemnification and contribution, the plaintiff seeks money damages and the implementation of certain governance proposals. 
 TDS is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. TDS intends to contest plaintiffs claims vigorously on the merits. 
 Refer to the disclosure under Legal Proceedings in TDS Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional information. Other than as described above, there have been no material changes to such information since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On August 2, 2013, the Board of Directors of TDS authorized, and TDS announced by Form 8-K, a 250 million stock repurchase program for TDS Common Shares. Depending on market conditions, such shares may be repurchased in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, or pursuant to accelerated share repurchase arrangements, prepaid share repurchases, private transactions or as otherwise authorized. This authorization does not have an expiration date. TDS did not determine to terminate the foregoing Common Share repurchase program, or cease making further purchases thereunder, during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was 132 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no purchases made by or on behalf of TDS, and no open market purchases made by any "affiliated purchaser" (as defined by the SEC) of TDS, of TDS Common Shares during the quarter covered by this Form 10-Q.

 Other Information 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of TDS directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) has or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act).
