FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical or current facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, liquidity, growth and profitability strategies and factors and trends affecting our business are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified in some cases by the use of words such as believe, can, could, potential, plan, predict, goals, seek, should, may, may have, would, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, the negative of these words, other similar expressions or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under Part II, Item 1A. " Risk Factors " of this Quarterly Report, and more comprehensively in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. 
 These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

million of cash on hand, million of working capital and approximately million of remaining capacity available for future sales of our common stock under our ATM program as defined and described further in Note 4, "ATM program" below. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any additional shares of our common stock under the ATM program and no assurance regarding

per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), because the closing bid price of the Company s common stock was below per share for consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were initially given a period of 180 calendar days from the date of notification, or until June 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which was not achieved. Effective May 31, 2024, trading in our common stock transferred from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. On June 21, 2024, we received notification from Nasdaq that we were approved for an additional 180-day period, or until December 17, 2024, to cure the bid price deficiency in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In order to achieve compliance with the Nasdaq requirements for continued listing, on November 8, 2024, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a with the exact ratio to be determined by our Board of Directors. At this time, , Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with this minimum bid price requirement. If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during this second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock is subject to delisting. Effective April 30, 2024, our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility) expired unused and has not been replaced as of September 30, 2024. As described further in Note 18, "Subsequent events" below, we signed a binding term sheet on November 8, 2024, with an institutional investor, for the issuance of million in long-term senior secured promissory notes, along with warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share. Closing on the transaction is expected on or before November 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had a contractual obligation that could require us to make additional capital contributions of up to million to Alpha Steel, as well as make a minimum level of purchases from Alpha Steel, as described further in Note 3, "Equity method investment" below. In the event we were to fail to meet our minimum required purchase commitments during a specified period, including the current period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025, we may be required to make a cash payment for the net profit attributable to any unfilled requirements, calculated as specified in the agreement, in an amount not to exceed million in the aggregate. In addition, we have made efforts during 2024 to enhance and strengthen our management leadership team. In August 2024, we hired Yann Brandt as our new Chief Executive Officer and, prior to that, we named Tamara Mullings, a former member of our Board of Directors, as our Senior Vice President, North America Sales and Alberto Echeverria, a former Chief Executive Officer and Executive Member of the Board of STI Norland, as our Senior Vice President, International Sales. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Going Concern, we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Management plans to address the liquidity needs of the Company by (i) executing the aforementioned million issuance of long-term senior secured notes, (ii) utilizing receipt of additional contingent earnout payments from our investment in Dimension Energy LLC that we sold in 2021, (iii) implementing additional cost savings steps, which could impact the level of services currently provided by third parties and our existing headcount, and (iv) utilizing capacity available for future sales of our common stock under the ATM program. We believe execution of these plans will allow us to fund our operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements. The successful execution of these plans is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, market conditions, the Company's ability to achieve projected cost savings and revenue targets and access to financing on favorable terms. There can be no assurance that these plans will be realized as anticipated and actual results may differ materially from those projected.

of our consolidated revenue. Most of our customers are project developers, solar asset owners and engineering, procurement and construction EPC contractors that design and build solar energy projects. We typically rely on a small number of customers that account for a large portion of our revenue each period and our outstanding receivables at each period end.

. We also accrue for costs relating to remediation efforts involving product issues we believe require correction. We record a provision for estimated warranty and remediation expenses in cost of sales, net of amounts recoverable from manufacturers under their warranty obligations to us. When historical claims information relating to our equipment is not sufficient, we will base our estimates on industry studies involving the nature and frequency of product failure rates for similar parts used by our competitors, as well as other related businesses. We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific projects. All actual or estimated material costs incurred for warranty or remediation services in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves. While we periodically monitor our warranty activities and claims, if actual costs incurred were to be different from our estimates, we would recognize adjustments to our warranty reserves in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. 
 
 and consists of subscription fees from the licensing of subscription services. Our hosted on-demand service arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the hosted services. Support services include ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance. We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below. Identify the contract with a customer: A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party s rights regarding the products and services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these products and services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for products and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. In assessing the recognition of revenue, we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one contract and if the combined or single contract should be accounted for as multiple performance obligations which could change the amount of revenue and profit (loss) recorded in a period. Change orders may include changes in specifications or design, manner of

million and million , respectively. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, from amounts included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2022, totaled million and million , respectively. Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to raw materials, equipment manufacturing activities, freight and delivery, product warranty, remediation and personnel costs (salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation). Personnel costs in cost of revenue include both direct labor costs, as well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the procurement, installment and delivery of the finished product and services. Cost of revenue owed but not yet paid is recorded as accrued cost of revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred cost of revenue, a component of our prepaid and other current assets, results from the timing differences between the costs incurred in advance of the satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria consistent with our revenue recognition policy.

. Alpha Steel is intended to enhance our domestic supply chain, our ability to support our customers and the growth of the U.S. solar market, with domestic manufacturing utilizing U.S. steel. We have a interest in Alpha Steel, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Taihua has a interest in Alpha Steel and DAYV LLC, an entity owned by members of the Board of Managers of Alpha Steel and a related party with the parent company of Taihua, has a interest in Alpha Steel. The Chief Executive Officer of Taihua is the General Manager of Alpha Steel. We have equal voting representation with Taihua and DAYV LLC, combined, on Alpha Steel's Board of Managers which is responsible, through majority vote, for making certain "major decisions" involving Alpha Steel, as specified in the LLC Agreement, including, among other things, approval of an annual business plan. During 2023, we made a required initial capital contribution of million to Alpha Steel. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also made required additional capital contributions totaling million . Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, we could be required to make up to million in future additional capital contributions as Alpha Steel continues to expand production. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized losses of million and million , respectively, which represent our share of the net operating losses incurred by Alpha Steel during each period. Our share of Alpha Steel losses recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled million in each period. In connection with the creation of Alpha Steel, we also entered into a three-year equipment supply agreement (the "Supply Agreement") with Alpha Steel, the terms of which will apply to our equipment purchase orders. In the event we fail to meet our minimum required purchase commitments in any period, we may be required to make a cash payment for the net profit attributable to any unfilled requirements, calculated as specified in the agreement, in an amount not to exceed million in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, we had met approximately of our required purchase commitments for the period ending June 30, 2025. The Supply Agreement may be terminated early in accordance with its provisions or may be extended beyond the initial term if mutually agreed to by the parties. At September 30, 2024, in addition to our requirement to meet the remaining minimum purchase obligations for the remainder of the year, as described above, we were contingently liable for unpaid vendor obligations, including issued but unsatisfied purchase orders, of Alpha Steel totaling approximately million . We expect Alpha Steel will be able to satisfy these obligations with financial resources available to them in the normal course of operations.

million in "at the money" offerings (the "ATM program"). We have and may continue to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital and operating expenses. We may also use a portion of such proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services or technologies. Barclays Capital Inc. ("Barclays") is our sales agent under the EDA. The offering of our common stock under the EDA will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all common stock subject to the EDA or (2) the termination of the EDA by us or by Barclays as permitted therein. The EDA contains customary representations, covenants and indemnification provisions. We sold shares of newly issued common stock under the ATM program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, however, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we sold and shares of newly issued common stock valued at million and million , respectively, for proceeds, net of commissions and fees, of approximately million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million of capacity remained for future sales of our common stock under the ATM program.

On April 3, 2024, we entered into a First Amendment ("the Amendment") to Master Project Supply Agreements dated October 11, 2021 with a customer and major solar project developer that owed us approximately million for project equipment we had previously completed and made available to the customer pursuant to the Master Project Supply Agreements. The Amendment was executed in consideration of and concurrent with the sale of the uncompleted projects by our customer, including the amended Master Project Supply Agreements, to a new third-party developer (the "Purchaser") who assumed certain obligations to us under the amended Master Project Supply Agreements. Pursuant to the Amendment, we received a cash payment of million from the Purchaser to acquire completed foundation piles, which are being stored at the request of the Purchaser for final delivery to the project sites, currently expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Overview 
 FTC Solar, Inc. (the Company , we , our , or us was founded in 2017 and is incorporated in the state of Delaware. In April 2021, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO"), and our common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol FTCI . 
 We are a global provider of solar tracker systems, supported by proprietary software and value-added engineering services. Solar tracker systems move solar panels throughout the day to maintain an optimal orientation relative to the sun, thereby increasing the amount of solar energy produced at a solar installation. Our original two-panel in-portrait solar tracker system is currently marketed under the Voyager brand name Voyager and our one module-in-portrait ("1P") solar tracker system, which became certified in 2023, is marketed under the Pioneer brand name ("Pioneer"). We also have a mounting solution to support the installation and use of U.S.-manufactured thin-film modules by project owners. Our primary software offerings include SUNPATH which is intended to help customers optimize solar tracking for increased energy production, our SUNOPS real-time operations management platform and our web-based ATLAS portfolio management software. In addition, we have a team of renewable energy professionals available to assist our U.S. and worldwide clients in site layout, structural design, pile testing and other needs across the solar project development and construction cycle. The Company is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and has international subsidiaries in Australia, China, India, South Africa and Spain. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Under the JOBS Act, we elected to use the allowed extended transition period to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Project Timing. Our level of manufacturing and logistics activity, and thus our revenue, can be significantly impacted by delays or changes in the expected timing of customer project development activity. In recent periods our customers have encountered delays in beginning or continuing project development caused by interconnection issues, including permit delays, equipment shortages, obtaining project financing at acceptable levels and addressing uncertainty in changes in government regulations, as described further below. Due to our limited number of large customers, such delays in project development activity can have a material impact on our quarterly and annual consolidated financial results. 
 Government Regulations. Changes in the U.S. trade environment, including the imposition of import tariffs, increases in existing tariffs, AD/CVD investigations and the UFLPA, which became effective in June 2022, can have an impact on the timing of developer projects. The UFLPA resulted in new rules for module importers and reviews by CBP. There is currently uncertainty in the market around achieving full compliance with UFLPA, whether related to sufficient traceability of materials or other factors. Escalating trade tensions, 
 23 

particularly between the United States and China, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to certain raw materials and components for our products. We have taken measures with the intention of mitigating the effect of tariffs and the impact of AD/CVD and UFLPA on our business by reducing our reliance on China and enhancing our U.S.-based supply chain, including through our investment in Alpha Steel, as described further in Note 3, "Equity method investment" in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. As an example, we have reduced our reliance on suppliers in China in terms of meeting our supply chain requirements from 90 in 2019 to less than 20 as of the date of this Quarterly Report. As of September 30, 2024, we have qualified suppliers outside of China for certain of our commodities and we continue to work to have second-source capability for all Chinese-manufactured components to help reduce the extent to which our supply chain for U.S.-based projects is subject to existing tariffs and to be able to quickly address potential future regulatory and governmental policy changes. We have entered into partnerships with manufacturers based in the United States, India, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Thailand and Vietnam to diversify our supply chain and optimize costs. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order allowing U.S. solar deployers to import solar modules and cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam free from certain duties for 24 months, along with other incentives designed to accelerate U.S. domestic production of clean energy technologies. However, on December 29, 2023, Auxin Solar, Inc. and Concept Clean Energy, Inc. filed suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the legal basis for the moratorium and implementing regulations. If the suit proves successful, solar module importers could owe retroactive duties on goods that have already cleared customs. 
 The most notable incentive program impacting our U.S. business has historically been the ITC for solar energy projects, which allows taxpayers to offset their U.S. federal income tax liability by a certain percentage of their cost basis in solar energy systems placed in service for commercial use. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, expanded and extended the tax credits and other tax benefits available to solar energy projects and the solar energy supply chain. ITCs have been extended for such projects through at least 2032 and, depending on the location of a particular project and its ability to satisfy certain labor and domestic content requirements, the ITC percentage can range between 30 and 50 . U.S. manufacturers of specific solar components are now eligible to claim production tax credits as an alternative to the ITC. Implementing regulations for this law are, in certain cases, still being finalized and the impact of these regulations continue to be evaluated by developers of new solar projects and manufacturers of solar components. We believe our investment in and commitments made to Alpha Steel will allow us to obtain certain benefits as a result of the production tax credit program, subject to our level of purchases from Alpha Steel. We believe this law will bolster and extend future demand for our products in the United States, however as the implementing regulations for this law are not completely finalized, this creates uncertainty about the extent of its impact on our Company and the solar energy industry. 
 Disruptions in Transportation and Supply Chain. Our costs are affected by the costs of certain components and materials, such as steel, motors and micro-chips, as well as transportation costs. Current market conditions and international conflicts that constrain the supply of materials and disrupt the flow of materials from international vendors can impact the cost of our products and services, along with overall rates of inflation in the global economy, which have been higher than pre-COVID 19 pandemic historical rates. While certain costs have moderated compared to pre-pandemic rates, domestic fuel prices continue to be elevated. Although we don't believe inflation has had a material impact on our results as presented in this report, such cost increases and decreases could impact our future operating margins, if material. 
 We have taken steps to expand and diversify our manufacturing partnerships and have adjusted our modes of transportation to mitigate the impact of headwinds that might arise in the global supply chain and logistics markets. As an example, we modified our ocean freight from previously using charter shipments to now using containerized shipments as costs in the container market began to decrease starting in 2022, but more recently have begun to increase. However, we have been able to mitigate some of this increase as a result of increasing our domestic production capabilities. We continue to monitor the logistics markets and will continue to evaluate our use of various modes of transportation when warranted to optimize our transportation costs. Additionally, from February 2022 to September 2023, we utilized a related-party consulting firm to support us in making improvements to our processes and performance in various areas, including design, sourcing, logistics, pricing, software and our distributed generation business. For further information regarding this consulting firm, see Note 16, "Related party transactions" included in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. We also intend to maintain a sharp focus on our design-to-value initiative to continue to improve margins by reducing manufacturing and material costs of our products. 
 Megawatts ("MW") Produced and MW Shipped and Average Selling Price ("ASP"). The primary operating metrics we use to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products are the change in quantity of MW produced and MW shipped from period to period. MW are measured for each individual project and are calculated based on the expected output of that project once installed and fully operational. We also utilize metrics related to price and cost of goods sold per watt, including the change in ASP from period to period and cost per watt. ASP is calculated by dividing product and service revenue by total watts produced or shipped and product and service cost per watt is calculated by dividing product or service costs of goods sold by total watts produced or shipped. These metrics enable us to evaluate trends in pricing, manufacturing and logistics costs and profitability. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global 
 24 

inflation rates, high interest rates and international conflicts have in the past impacted and may continue to impact the U.S. economy, global supply chains, and our business. These impacts can cause significant project development and shipping delays and cost increases, as well as offsetting ASP increases, and also raise the price of inputs like steel and logistics, affecting our cost per watt. 
 Investment in Technology and Personnel. We invest in both the people and technology behind our products. We intend to continue making significant investments in the technology for our products and expansion of our patent portfolio to attract and retain customers, expand the capabilities and scope of our products, and enhance user experience. As an example, in August 2023, we introduced SUNOPS, a cloud-based, tracker-agnostic solar asset monitoring solution allowing asset owners and managers to evaluate the operation and performance of their solar deployments. Additionally, in May 2024, we announced the launch of our Automated Hail Stow Solution, aimed at minimizing solar panel damage caused by hail storms. This solution integrates advanced technology with meteorological data to automatically adjust the positioning of solar panels, reducing the risk of hail-related damage. 
 We also intend over time to make significant investments to attract and retain employees in key positions, including sales leads, engineers, software developers, quality assurance personnel, supply chain personnel, product management, and operations personnel, to help us drive additional efficiencies across our marketplace and, in the case of sales leads, to continue to enhance and diversify our sales capabilities, including international expansion. For example, in May 2024, we announced the appointment of Tamara Mullings, a former member of our Board of Directors, to be our Senior Vice President, North American Sales and Alberto Echeverria, a tracker industry veteran and the former Chief Executive Officer and Executive Member of the Board of STI Norland, to be our Senior Vice President, International Sales. Additionally, effective August 19, 2024, we hired Yann Brandt as our new President and Chief Executive Officer and as a new member of our Board of Directors. 
 Impact of Climate Change. Climate change has primarily impacted our business operations by increasing demand for solar power generation and, as a result, for use of our products. According to the August 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar power is the fastest-growing source of electricity in the United States. 
 While climate change has not resulted in any material negative impact to our operations to date, we recognize the risk of disruptions to our supply chain due to extreme weather events. This, among other things, has led us to expand the diversity of our supplier base and to partner with more local suppliers to reduce shipping and transportation needs. We are also increasingly partnering with larger scale steel producers rather than smaller suppliers to facilitate scaling of our operations while remaining conscious of the environmental impacts of steel manufacturing as the regulatory landscape around these high-emitting industries evolves. An example of this strategy is our investment in Alpha Steel, a U.S.-based manufacturing partnership with Taihua, a leading steel fabricator. 
 We also attempt to mitigate the climate-related risks from the use of our products by designing our equipment and systems to have a high-slope tolerance and wind mitigation capabilities, while at the same time reducing the required foundation/pile count needed. This allows our trackers to be installed in increasingly hostile environments with minimal disturbance to the surrounding land. 
 Liquidity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of the impact of the items above on our liquidity position. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 The following discussion describes certain line items in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 Revenue 
 Revenue from the sale of our solar tracker systems and customized components of those systems is recognized over time, as work progresses, utilizing an input measure of progress determined by cost incurred to date relative to total expected cost on these projects to correlate with our performance in transferring control over the tracker systems and their components. Revenue from the sale of individual parts is recognized at a point in time as and when control transfers based on the terms of the contract. Revenue from sale of term-based software licenses is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. Revenue for shipping and handling services is recognized over time based on progress in meeting shipping terms of the arrangements. Revenue for stand-alone engineering consulting and pile testing services is recognized at a point in time upon completion of the services performed. Subscription revenue, which is derived from our subscription-based enterprise licensing model, and support revenue, which is derived from ongoing security updates and maintenance, are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. 
 25 

Our customers include project developers, solar asset owners and EPC contractors that design and build solar energy projects. For each individual solar project, we enter into a contract with our customers covering the price, specifications, delivery dates and warranty for the products being purchased, among other things. Our contractual delivery period for our solar tracker systems and related parts can vary depending on size of the project and availability of vessels and other means of delivery. Contracts can range in value from tens of thousands to tens of millions of dollars. 
 Our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and ASP of our solar tracking systems purchased by our customers and volume of sales of software products and engineering services, among other things. The ASP of our solar tracker systems and quarterly volume of sales is driven by the supply of, and demand for, our products, changes in product mix, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitors product offerings, tariff and import restrictions, supply chain issues and availability of government incentives to the end-users of our products. Additionally, our revenue may be impacted by seasonality due to cold weather, which can cause variability in site construction activity. 
 For the periods included in this Quarterly Report, no company locations other than those in the United States accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue. Our revenue growth is dependent on continued growth in the number of solar tracker projects and engineering services we win in competitive bidding processes and growth in our software sales each year, as well as our ability to increase our market share in each of the geographies in which we currently compete, expand our global footprint to new emerging markets, grow our sources of production to meet demand and continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, among other things. 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit (loss) 
 We subcontract with third-party companies to manufacture and deliver our products directly to our customers. Our product costs are affected by the underlying cost of raw materials procured by these contract manufacturers, including steel and aluminum; component costs, including electric motors and gearboxes; technological innovation in manufacturing processes; and our ability to achieve economies of scale resulting in lower component costs. We do not currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials, but we continue to explore opportunities to mitigate the risks of foreign currency and commodity fluctuations through the use of hedges and foreign exchange lines of credit. Some of these costs, primarily personnel, are not directly affected by sales volume. 
 We have made changes to our headcount in recent years as we initially scaled up our business following our IPO and, more recently, reduced our headcount on certain occasions in response to declines in project activity levels. Our gross profit may vary period-to-period due to changes in our headcount, ASP, product costs, product mix, customer mix, geographical mix, shipping methods, warranty costs and seasonality. 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and include salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation expenses. 
 We implemented reductions in our global workforce at the end of 2022 and in August 2023, in response to regulatory and other issues that were negatively impacting our solar project activity levels. We also had certain executive departures near the end of 2023, as well as additions of certain new executives during 2024, including a new Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our operating costs have been impacted by (i) our level of research activities to originate, develop and enhance our products, (ii) our sales and marketing efforts as we expand our development activities in other parts of the world, and (iii) variations in legal and professional fees, compliance costs, insurance, facility costs and other costs associated with strategic changes in response to changing market conditions and other matters.

Product revenue 
 The decrease in product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease of 82 in the amount of MW produced as activity has been adversely impacted by customer project delays. This was partially offset by an increase in ASP for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of better pricing and project mix changes as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Service revenue 
 The decrease in service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulted from (i) a decrease of 29 in ASP as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) lower engineering consulting revenues. This was partially offset by an increase of 18 in the amount of MW delivered as a result of timing of project deliveries. 
 27 

Cost of revenue and gross profit (loss) 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to raw materials, equipment manufacturing activities, freight and delivery, product warranty, remediation and personnel costs (salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation). Personnel costs in cost of revenue include both direct labor costs, as well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the procurement, installment and delivery of the finished product and services. 
 Gross profit may vary from period-to-period and is primarily affected by our ASP, product costs, timing of tracker production and delivery, customer mix, geographical mix, shipping method, logistics costs, warranty costs, indirect cost control efforts and seasonality.

11.1 

The decrease in cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by (i) a decrease of 82 in MW produced. This was partially offset by higher remediation costs. 
 Our gross margin percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a negative 42.5 , as compared to a positive 11.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We had negative gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the impact of lower revenue levels on our ability to cover certain relatively fixed overhead costs. 
 We had positive gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to (i) higher production activity allowing us to cover certain relatively fixed overhead costs, (ii) a mix of higher margin product revenue as compared to service revenue, and (iii) improvements in our direct cost structure due to our design-to-value efforts, lower levels of remediation and warranty costs, as well as reduced overhead spending resulting from our other cost control efforts. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and travel expense related to our engineers performing research and development activities to originate, develop and enhance our products. Additional expenses include consulting charges, component purchases and other costs for performing research and development on our software products.

The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to (i) lower spending on lab and other research activities of 0.2 million, (ii) lower payroll costs of 0.2 million due to severance costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and (iii) lower professional service costs of 0.1 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 14.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the percentage research and development costs to revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is largely a function of the lower level of revenue.

The decrease in selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to (i) lower provisions for credit losses of 3.4 million, mainly related to charges associated with specific individual customer accounts during each period, (ii) lower marketing costs of 0.2 million associated with reduced trade show attendance and advertising, and (iii) lower payroll costs of 0.1 million due to severance costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lower travel and stock-based compensation expense accounted for the remaining decrease. Selling and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue were 23.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and travel expense related to our executives, finance team, and administrative employees. It also consists of legal, consulting, and professional fees, rent and lease expense pertaining to our headquarters and international offices, business insurance costs and certain other costs.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to (i) a nonrecurring charge of 3.2 million in September 2023 as we fully amortized the remaining prepaid balance upon termination of the Service Agreement with a related party consultant, and (ii) lower payroll costs of 1.5 million largely as a result of severance costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 67.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to the lower level of revenue.

Product revenue 
 The decrease in product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease of 73 in the amount of MW produced as activity has been adversely impacted by customer project delays. This was partially offset by an increase in ASP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of better pricing and project mix changes as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Service revenue 
 The decrease in service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulted from (i) a decrease of 63 in the amount of MW delivered as a result of timing and lower volume of projects available for delivery, and (ii) a decrease of 16 in ASP as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (iii) lower engineering consulting and software revenues.

The decrease in cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by (i) a decrease of 73 in MW produced, (ii) a decrease of 63 in shipping and logistics activity, and (iii) by lower obsolete and slow-moving inventory provisions. Partially offsetting the decrease were higher warranty and remediation costs. 
 Our gross margin percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a negative 25.6 , as compared to a positive 7.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We had negative gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as (i) production volumes were not sufficient to cover certain relatively fixed overhead costs, and (ii) our service revenue was not sufficient to fully cover our warehousing and certain other costs. 
 We had positive gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to (i) sufficiently high production activity levels allowing us to cover certain relatively fixed overhead costs, (ii) a mix of higher margin product revenue as compared to service revenue, (iii) good product ASP, as well as (iv) improvements in our direct costs due to our design-to-value efforts, low levels of remediation and warranty costs, and reduced overhead spending compared to prior periods resulting from our other cost control efforts, including headcount reductions.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to 3.5 million of lower stock-based compensation expense related primarily to (i) forfeiture of awards in connection with the September 2023 termination of the Service Agreement with a related party as described further in Note 16, "Related party transactions" in Part I, Item 1 above, (ii) forfeiture of awards in connection with our reduction in force in August 2023 and executive terminations during the fourth quarter of 2023, and (iii) the absence of stock-based incentive compensation awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In connection with the termination of the Service Agreement with a related party consultant, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the employee and executive terminations described above contributed to lower payroll expense of 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we were able to lower our insurance costs by 1.4 million, our legal costs by 0.4 million and our accounting and audit fees by 0.5 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, through our cost control initiatives. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 56.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to the lower level of revenue.

We sold our interest in our unconsolidated subsidiary, Dimension Energy LLC ("Dimension"), on June 24, 2021. Dimension is a community solar developer based in Atlanta, Georgia that provides renewable energy solutions for local communities in the United States. The sales agreement with Dimension included an earnout provision which provides the potential to receive additional contingent consideration of up to approximately 14.0 million through December 2024, based on Dimension achieving certain performance milestones. The sales agreement also includes a projects escrow release which is an additional contingent consideration to receive 7 million based on Dimension s completion of certain construction projects in progress at the time of the sale. We made an accounting policy election to account for the contingent gains arising from earnout payments and project escrow releases only when those amounts become realizable in the periods subsequent to the disposal date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received earnout and escrow release payments of 4.1 million and 0.9 million, respectively, that were recognized in accordance with our policy election. Since the sale of our interest in Dimension, we have received a total of 7.4 million in contingent earnout and escrow release payments through September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of shares of common stock, including our IPO in April 2021, issuance of debt and payments from our customers. Our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations is dependent on our level of production, contract payment terms, timely collections from our customers and the strength of our gross margins. 
 We have incurred cumulative losses since inception and have a history of cash outflows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.3 million of cash on hand, 18.9 million of working capital and approximately 64.9 million of remaining capacity available for future sales of our common stock under our ATM program as defined and described further in Note 4, "ATM program" in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any additional shares of our common stock under the ATM program and no assurance regarding the price at which we will be able to sell such shares, and any sales of our common stock under the ATM program may be at prices that result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. 
 On December 22, 2023, we received notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), because the closing bid price of the Company s common stock was below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were initially given a period of 180 calendar days from the date of notification, or until June 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which was not achieved. Effective May 31, 2024, trading in our common stock transferred from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. On June 21, 2024, we received notification from Nasdaq that we were approved for an additional 180-day period, or until December 17, 2024, to cure the bid price deficiency in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In order to achieve compliance with the Nasdaq requirements for continued listing, on November 8, 2024, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio ranging from 1-for-5 to 1-for 25, with the exact ratio to be determined by our Board of Directors. At this time, our common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "FTCI". If at any time before December 17, 2024, the bid price of our common stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with this minimum bid price requirement. If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during this second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock is subject to delisting. 
 Effective April 30, 2024, our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility) expired unused and has not been replaced as of September 30, 2024. As described further in Note 18, "Subsequent events" in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, we signed a binding term sheet on November 8, 2024, with an institutional investor, for the issuance of 15 million in long-term senior secured promissory notes, along with warrants to purchase 17.5 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.01 per share. Closing on the transaction is expected on or before November 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a contractual obligation that could require us to make additional capital contributions of up to 0.8 million to Alpha Steel, as well as make a minimum level of purchases from Alpha Steel, as described further in Note 3, "Equity method investment" in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. In the event we were to fail to meet our minimum required purchase commitments during a specified period, including the current period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025, we may be required to make a cash payment for the net profit attributable to any unfilled requirements, calculated as specified in the agreement, in an amount not to exceed 4.0 million in the aggregate. 
 In addition, we have made efforts during 2024 to enhance and strengthen our management leadership team. In August 2024, we hired Yann Brandt as our new Chief Executive Officer and, prior to that, we named Tamara Mullings, a former member of our Board of Directors, as our Senior Vice President, North America Sales and Alberto Echeverria, a former Chief Executive Officer and Executive Member of the Board of STI Norland, as our Senior Vice President, International Sales. 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Going Concern, we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 33 

Management plans to address the liquidity needs of the Company by (i) executing the aforementioned 15 million issuance of long-term senior secured notes, (ii) utilizing receipt of additional contingent earnout payments from our investment in Dimension that we sold in 2021, (iii) implementing additional cost savings steps, which could impact the level of services currently provided by third parties and our existing headcount, and (iv) utilizing capacity available for future sales of our common stock under the ATM program. We believe execution of these plans will allow us to fund our operations for at least one year from the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The successful execution of these plans is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, market conditions, the Company's ability to achieve projected cost savings and revenue targets and access to financing on favorable terms. There can be no assurance that these plans will be realized as anticipated and actual results may differ materially from those projected.

Operating activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used approximately 26.3 million of cash to fund a portion of our current period expenditures for personnel and facilities, legal and professional fees, insurance, research and development and various other operating activities. This compares to approximately 18.6 million of cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, also to fund a portion of our prior period expenditures for various operating activities as described above. 
 Approximately 8.3 million of cash was generated from working capital and other decreases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of production activity levels and the timing of customer receipts, including the settlement reached with a major customer as described further in Note 5, "Accounts receivable, net" in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, and payments to our vendors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used approximately 27.8 million of cash for working capital and other increases as a result of production activity and the timing of customer receipts and vendor payments, net of inventory utilization. 
 Our working capital decreased by approximately 35.0 million from 53.8 million at December 31, 2023 to 18.9 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease was largely attributable to (i) the use of cash to fund current period expenditures as described above and (ii) the impact of lower activity levels on the amount of billed and unbilled accounts receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made additional equity investments of 1.8 million in Alpha Steel, a manufacturing partnership with Taihua, in which we hold a 45 interest. Pursuant to our agreement with Alpha Steel, we could be required to make up to 0.8 million in future additional capital contributions as Alpha Steel continues to expand production. We also spent nearly 1.4 million, mainly for tooling and new computer and IT equipment, as well as leasehold improvements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we received 4.1 million of contingent earnout payments in connection with the June 2021 sale of our equity interest in Dimension. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made (i) an initial equity investment of 0.9 million in Alpha Steel, (ii) received 0.9 million in contingent payments from escrow in connection with the sale of our equity interest in Dimension as described above, and (iii) spent nearly 0.5 million for leasehold improvements, tooling, software, and new computer and IT equipment. 
 34 

Financing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold newly issued shares of our common stock in various daily transactions under our ATM program, receiving cash proceeds of 34.0 million. We also received 0.2 million of proceeds from employee exercises of stock options. 
 Revolving line of credit 
 Our Credit Facility, entered into in 2021 with various lenders, including Barclays Bank PLC, as issuing lender, the swingline lender and as administrative agent, expired unused on April 30, 2024. The Credit Facility has not currently been replaced. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates 
 Preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported revenue and expenses during the period. Estimates are used for calculating the measure of progress of our solar tracker projects and deriving the standalone selling prices of the individual performance obligations when determining amounts to recognize for revenue, estimating allowances for credit losses and slow-moving and obsolete inventory, determining useful lives of long-lived assets and the estimated fair value of those assets for impairment assessments, and estimating the fair value of investments, stock compensation awards, warranty liabilities and federal and state taxes, including tax valuation allowances, as well as other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties. 
 To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
 Revenue recognition 
 Our accounting policy on revenue recognition may be found in Note 2, "Summary of significant accounting policies" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Judgments and assumptions 
 The timing and amounts of revenue and cost of revenue recognition, as well as recording of related receivables and deferred revenue, is highly dependent on our identification of performance obligations in each contract and our estimates by contract of total project cost and our progress toward project completion as of each period end. Certain estimates are subject to factors outside of our control that may impact our suppliers and the global supply chain. As an example, we began to experience increases in steel prices and shipping and logistics costs, as well as delays in delivery of our products to customers during 2021, which negatively impacted our results of operations as we were not able to recover all of the additional costs under certain of our fixed fee contracts. In addition, regulatory, tariff and import concerns such as those caused by the UFLPA and the Solar Circumvention Investigation have in the past, and may continue to, affect our ability to obtain project materials and may delay the timing of customer project activity which has had in the past, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations, including the expected timing of the recognition of revenue needed to cover our relatively fixed overhead costs. We base our estimates on the best information available at each period end, but future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, and actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates. 
 35 

Accounts receivable, net 
 Our accounting policy relating to our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses may be found in Note 2, "Summary of significant accounting policies" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Judgments and assumptions 
 The allowance for credit losses is based on the lifetime expected credit loss of our customer accounts. To assess the lifetime expected credit loss, we utilize a loss rate method that takes into consideration historical experience and certain other factors, as appropriate, such as credit quality and current economic or other conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. This method accelerates the recognition of expected credit losses as compared to the incurred loss model used prior to 2023 and may result in material differences between our estimates and actual collection results. We may also have greater fluctuations in our credit loss expense over time based on changes in our historical experience or changes in estimates of future economic conditions which may not adequately reflect future actual customer payment activity. 
 Adjustments to the allowance are largely dependent on historical experience involving amounts previously collected from our customers in recent years or based on specific changes in a customer's ability to pay. As an example, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized credit loss provisions of 1.3 million and 4.3 million, respectively, in our selling and marketing expenses, primarily related to a specific customer's inability to fully pay amounts owed. Historical experience, when used in making such adjustments, may not reflect current actual experience. 
 Warranty 
 Our accounting policy relating to our warranty obligations may be found in Note 2, "Summary of significant accounting policies" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Judgments and assumptions 
 We base our estimated warranty obligations on available industry data relating to the nature and frequency of product failure rates and, where possible, on our historical experience, to make estimates of costs to address future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience or fluctuations in available industry data may result in material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Additionally, we make estimates of what costs we believe will be recoverable from the manufacturers of our products that we use to offset our obligations to our customers. 
 While we periodically monitor our warranty activities and claims, if actual costs incurred were to be different from our estimates, we would recognize adjustments to our warranty reserves in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Such adjustments could be material to cost of revenue in our results of operations in the period the adjustments are made. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 Our accounting policy relating to our stock-based compensation may be found in Note 2, "Summary of significant accounting policies" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Judgments and assumptions 
 The Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations rely on various assumptions, in addition to the exercise price of an option award and the value of our common stock on the date of grant. These assumptions include: 
 Expected Term: The expected term represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is calculated for option grants as the average of the option vesting and contractual terms, based on the simplified method, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for options granted. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The contractual life of an option may be up to 10 years. Monte Carlo simulations, as described below, estimate the derived service period of awards with market conditions. 
 36 

Expected Volatility: Since the Company did not have a trading history of its common stock prior to our IPO and since such trading history subsequent to our IPO is limited and may be less than the expected term of an award, the expected volatility is derived from a weighted average of (i) our historical volatility over our entire trading history, with respect to certain more recent awards, and (ii) the average historical stock volatilities of several public companies within the Company s industry that it considers to be comparable to its business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants, or awards granted with market conditions. 
 Risk-Free-Interest-Rate: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term or derived service or performance period. 
 Expected Dividend: The Company has not issued any dividends in its history and does not expect to issue dividends over the life of option grants or awards with market conditions and, therefore, has estimated the dividend yield to be zero. 
 We used Monte Carlo simulations for certain awards granted with market conditions which provided an estimated average present value for each award based on a simulation assuming Geometric Brownian Motion in a risk-neutral framework using up to 250,000 simulation paths to determine the derived service and vesting periods. 
 Our use of the simplified method for estimating the expected outstanding term of our options may differ significantly from future actual exercise patterns of our option holders. Estimates of the outstanding term of our options that are less than the actual exercise patterns of our option holders, may result in lower recognized expense. Alternatively, our recognized expense may be higher if our option holders exercise their options sooner than our estimates project. 
 Similarly, our use of a volatility estimate based on historical stock volatilities of a peer group of other public companies may differ significantly from the actual future volatility of our stock over the term options or awards with market conditions are held. Higher estimated volatility compared to future actual results may result in higher recognized expense and alternatively, lower expected volatility compared to future actual results may result in lower recognized expense. 
 Changes to any of our assumptions, but particularly our estimates of expected term or derived service period and volatility, could change the fair value of our options or awards with market conditions and impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense we report each period. 
 Impairment 
 Our accounting policies relating to impairment of our long-lived assets held for use, including intangible assets, and of goodwill may be found in Note 2, "Summary of significant accounting policies" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Judgments and assumptions 
 Key judgments and assumptions involving our assessment of impairment of our long-lived and intangible assets, as well as goodwill, may include: 
 Determination of whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets or goodwill might be impaired. Such factors to consider may include an evaluation of changes in the business or regulatory climate, market conditions or other events impacting our operations; 

Estimating future cash flows of our long-lived assets or asset groups and intangible assets, which may involve assumptions as to the lowest level of our assets at which cash flows are generated, including future growth and risk-adjusted discount rates, as well as a terminal growth rate or value and future market conditions; 

Estimates of assumptions a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the affected long-lived assets or asset groups; and 

Estimating the fair value of the consolidated company. 

37 

In estimating the fair value of the consolidated company, we used our market capitalization based on our closing stock price on the Nasdaq Capital Market at September 30, 2024. Our daily closing stock price is affected by numerous factors, some of which may not directly involve the operations of the company and, historically, has demonstrated high volatility. 
 We did not identify any impairments of our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 JOBS Act accounting election 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to use the allowed extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") 
 We utilize Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus (i) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (ii) interest expense, net, (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization of intangibles, (v) stock-based compensation, and (vi) Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") transition costs, non-routine legal fees, severance and certain other costs (credits). We also deduct the contingent gains arising from earnout payments and project escrow releases relating to the disposal of our investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary from net loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted Net Loss as net loss plus (i) amortization of debt issue costs and intangibles, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) CEO transition costs, non-routine legal fees, severance and certain other costs (credits), and (iv) the income tax expense (benefit) of those adjustments, if any. We also deduct the contingent gains arising from earnout payments and project escrow releases relating to the disposal of our investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary in arriving at Adjusted Net Loss. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using our weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as supplemental measures of performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on an ongoing basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. 
 Among other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS do not reflect (i) our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, and (ii) the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Further, the adjustments noted in Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of any income tax expense or benefit. Additionally, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS differently than we do, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and you should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. These non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely applicable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below:

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of customer concentrations and fluctuations in steel, aluminum and logistics/transportation prices. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term loans and accounts payable. Cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term loans and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. 
 40 

We had 8.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, the vast majority of which was located in the United States, and no debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We regularly maintain cash balances with various financial institutions that exceed federally insured amounts, but we have experienced no losses associated with these amounts to date. We also took action in early 2023 to reallocate cash balances between different financial institutions based on our assessment as to the financial health of certain institutions. 
 Certain of our cash equivalents include deposits in money market funds that invest primarily in short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities and contain no restrictions on immediate redemption. The carrying value for these money market fund deposits approximates fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for units held (Level 1 classification) and totaled 1.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 We have no other financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, other than cash equivalents, short-term loans and certain non-functional currency intercompany and third-party receivables and payables, which are subject to foreign exchange, interest rate or market risks. 
 Concentrations of major customers 
 Our customers include project developers, solar asset owners and EPC contractors that design and build solar energy projects. We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business, often without requiring collateral. We also perform credit analyses and monitor the financial health of our customers to reduce credit risk. 
 We typically rely on a small number of customers that account for a large portion of our revenue each period and our outstanding receivables at each period end. 
 Further, our accounts receivables are from companies within or serving the solar industry and, as such, we are exposed to normal industry credit risks. We continually evaluate our reserves for potential credit losses and establish initial reserves based on our expectation of lifetime expected credit losses. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We subcontract to various contract manufacturers, who manufacture and deliver products directly to our customers. We, therefore, do not procure raw materials and commodities directly, except for items added to our inventory. We are subject to indirect risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including steel and aluminum, which are used in our products, through our contract manufacturers, as increases in these commodity prices would increase our cost of procuring subcontracting services. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time. Significant price increases for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases in costs from our customers, and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 41 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We hired a new President and Chief Executive Officer effective August 19, 2024, who assumed the duties of evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures previously performed by our Chairman of the Board of Directors. 
 
 42 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1.	LEG AL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other proceedings, arising in the normal course of business. 
 In March of 2023, CBP issued notices of tariff assessment that indicated an action taken at the Import Specialist (i.e., the port) level with respect to merchandise imported from Thailand under entry number 004-1058562-5 (the 625 Assessment and entry number 004-1063793-9 (the Original 939 Assessment , and collectively with the 625 Assessment, the Original CBP Assessments ). The Original CBP Assessments related to certain torque beams that are used in our Voyager+ product that were imported in 2022. In the Original CBP Assessments, CBP asserted that Section 301 China tariffs, Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, and antidumping and countervailing duties applied to the merchandise. Based on correspondence received to date from CBP and our calculations based on applicable duty and tariff rates, the 625 Assessment is currently for approximately 2.84 million. In September of 2023, CBP informed us (the "Revised 939 Assessment", and together with the 625 Assessment, the "Revised CBP Assessments") that the amount owed under the Original 939 Assessment was being revised downward to approximately 2.01 million. In particular, CBP accepted our position that the Section 301 tariffs of 25 or 7.5 of the value of the merchandise, depending on tariff classification, as well as the antidumping and countervailing duties, previously assessed under the Original 939 Assessment are not applicable as they are only applicable to articles that originate in China and that, in this case, the finished goods are products of Thailand. 
 Upon review of the facts involved, and in consultation with outside legal counsel, we believe that the remaining amounts claimed in the Revised CBP Assessments are incorrect. In particular, the Section 301 tariffs of 25 or 7.5 of the value of the merchandise, depending on tariff classification, as well as the antidumping and countervailing duties, are not applicable under the 625 Assessment for the same reason stated above with respect to the Revised 939 Assessment, which has been accepted by CBP. Moreover, with respect to both Revised CBP Assessments, we believe that the goods in question were properly classified as parts of structures at the time of importation and that when properly classified, the beams and other materials are not subject to Section 232 duties applicable to more basic steel products. 
 CBP has legally finalized both Revised CBP Assessments. We filed a formal protest for the 625 Assessment in September of 2023 and for the Revised 939 Assessment in March of 2024. Based on the above, and under the relevant accounting guidance related to loss contingencies, we have made no accrual for the amounts claimed by CBP as of September 30, 2024, as we do not consider these amounts to be a probable obligation, as such term is defined and interpreted under the relevant accounting guidance, for us at this time. However, because matters of this nature are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments, including future assessments of additional duties or tariffs owed in respect of other shipments or other materials beyond what is presently included in the Revised CBP Assessments, could occur despite our belief that the tariffs and duties asserted are incorrect, there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges that are not currently recorded as liabilities. Since the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the costs associated with them could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS 
 We are subject to a number of risks that if realized could adversely affect our business, strategies, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the more significant risks and uncertainties we face include those summarized below. The summary below is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report. Please carefully consider all of the information in this Quarterly Report and our 2023 Annual Report, including the full set of risks set forth in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report, and in our other filings with the SEC before making an investment decision regarding us. 
 Risks related to our business and our industry We are a relatively new public company with a history of losses that provides products and services to the solar industry, which is rapidly changing and dependent on being competitive with the price of electricity generated from other sources. We face competition from other companies that may be larger than us and have more financial resources than we have which could impact our ability to compete for new business. We also currently rely on a limited number of customers which may have material adverse effects on our revenue, operating results and cash flows. 

Risks related to government regulations and legal compliance We face risks to the demand for our products from our customers due to changes in, or expiration of, governmental incentives and existing tax credits and other benefits. Additionally, 

43 

changes in the trade environment and tax treaties between the United States and other countries, such as China, as well as import tariffs and other laws and regulations that impact the ability to import our products or other products necessary for the construction of solar energy projects, have adversely and could continue to adversely affect our business. 

Risks related to manufacturing and supply chain We face risks in meeting the needs of our customers due to our reliance on a limited number of contract manufacturers, including on their ability to obtain raw materials in a cost effective and timely manner and to provide timely deliveries of finished products to us and our customers. 

Risks related to intellectual property We face the risk of not being able to adequately protect or defend our intellectual property and property rights in the various countries in which we do business. 

Risks related to information technology and data privacy We face reputational and monetary risks from cybersecurity incidents and the unauthorized disclosure of personal or sensitive data relating to our employees, customers, vendors and others. 

Risks related to ownership of our common stock The holders of our common stock face a risk of loss in their investment in us due to fluctuations in our stock price as a result of changing market conditions, any future issuances of stock, our future financial performance, our corporate legal structure, the substantial ownership in our stock by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders and the potential for our common stock to not be able to trade in active, liquid markets. 

Risks related to health epidemics We face risks of our business being adversely impacted by the effects of future widespread outbreaks of contagious disease. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant supply chain disruptions beginning in 2020 that, for a period of time, resulted in delays in product delivery and completion and caused increased transportation costs, as well as labor shortages. 

As described further in Note 2 in Part I, Item 1 under the section "Liquidity" and in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report under the section "Liquidity and Capital Resources", we have a history of cash outflows to fund operations. 
 In addition, on October 11, 2024, we filed a definitive proxy for a special meeting of stockholders scheduled for November 8, 2024, to seek approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split. We may not receive approval from our stockholders for the amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or if approval is given, our Board of Directors may choose not to proceed with the reverse stock split in time to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. Also, if a reverse stock split is effected, there can be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement before December 17, 2024, then Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock is subject to delisting.

 ITEM 5.	OTHER INF ORMATION 
 (a) Information required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the period covered by this Form 10-Q, but not reported. 

On November 8, 2024, we entered into a binding term sheet with an institutional investor (the Investor to issue to the Investor, in a private placement, senior secured promissory notes (the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 15 million and common stock purchase warrants (the Warrants to purchase 17,500,000 shares of our common stock. 
 The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 11 per annum if payable in cash or, at our options, 13 per annum if paid-in-kind and will mature five (5) years from the date of issuance. The Notes will be secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and will be guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Notes will contain customary covenants for a transaction of this nature, including financial covenants and restrictive covenants. If we prepay the Notes in full within a specified period of time after issuance, we will be required to pay a make-whole payment to the Investor representing a portion of the undiscounted interest payments that otherwise would have been payable to the Investor, the calculation for which will be specified in the definitive documents. 
 The Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.01 per share, subject to certain customary adjustments to be set forth in the definitive documentation, and will expire ten (10) years from the date of issuance. At the option of the Investor, the Warrants will also be exercisable on a cashless basis using a customary cashless exercise formula. 
 We have also agreed that the Investor shall be entitled to nominate one (1) person for election to our board of directors at our annual stockholder meeting. We have also agreed to reimburse the Investor for expenses incurred in connection with the transaction in an amount equal to three percent (3 of the principal amount of the Notes. 
 The issuance of the Notes and Warrants will be subject to customary closing conditions and the preparation and negotiation of definitive documents. We currently expect that the issuance of the Notes and Warrants will occur on or prior to November 30, 2024.
