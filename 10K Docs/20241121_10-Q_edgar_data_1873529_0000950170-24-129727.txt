Additionally, as of the effective date of the amendment, amounts drawn under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable rate between and per annum, and fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit bear interest at an applicable rate between and per annum, based on a pricing grid of the Company s First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement allows for letters of credit to be drawn against the current borrowing capacity of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, capped at million. The Company pays certain fees under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, including a fronting fee of per annum, as well as fees on the unused portion of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility at a rate between and per annum, based on a pricing grid of the Company's First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. Prior to the amendment, the First Lien Term Loan Facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus per annum. Additionally, prior to the April 2024 amendment, amounts drawn under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at SOFR plus an applicable rate between and per annum, and fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit bore interest at an applicable rate between and per annum, based on a pricing grid of the Company s First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. All other terms under the Credit Agreement remain unchanged as a result of the amendments. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events , for information on debt transactions that occurred subsequent to September 28, 2024. Principal payments on the First Lien Term Loan Facility are payable in arrears on the last business day of each calendar year quarter, with the final payment of the remaining principal balance due in June 2030 when the First Lien Term Loan Facility matures. Interest payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are payable in arrears on the last business day of each calendar year quarter. The First Lien Revolving Credit Facility matures in June 2028. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and nonfinancial loan covenants and provisions. Commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2023, the Company must comply with a quarterly maximum First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio financial loan covenant. The First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio is required to be tested only if, on the last day of each fiscal quarter, the amount of revolving loans outstanding under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, excluding all letters of credit, exceeds of total revolving commitments on such date. Nonfinancial loan covenants restrict the Company s ability to, among other things, incur additional debt; make fundamental changes to the business; make certain restricted payments, investments, acquisitions, and dispositions; or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement. An annual calculation of excess cash flows, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024, determines if the Company will be required to make a mandatory prepayment on the First Lien Term Loan Facility. Mandatory prepayments would reduce future required quarterly principal payments. Other Credit Facilities In February 2024, the Company entered into a credit facilities agreement (the "LOC Agreement") which allows for million in letters of credit to be issued. The Company pays certain fees under the LOC Agreement, including fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit at a rate of per annum and fees on the unused portion of letters of credit at a rate of per annum. Fees on the letters of credit are payable in arrears on the last business day of each March, June, September, and December. The LOC Agreement matures in December 2026. Upon entering into the LOC Agreement, the Company issued million in letters of credit and cancelled million of outstanding letters of credit under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had outstanding borrowings on the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility and had an available borrowing capacity of million after giving effect to the outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement of million as of September 28, 2024 .

debt issuance costs were incurred during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Company recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 related to the unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs that were written off in connection with certain lenders that had reduced principal holdings or did not participate in the loan syndication as a result of the April 2024 amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Company recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the unamortized deferred financing costs that were written off in connection with the term loans and senior secured notes that were extinguished. Losses from extinguishment of debt are recognized in interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company did not incur any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

. The notional amount of the derivative instrument was million as of December 30, 2023 and million immediately prior to its expiration on June 28, 2024 and decreased quarterly as principal payments were made on the First Lien Term Loan Facility. The Company paid initial costs of million for the interest rate cap. The Company elected to exclude the change in the time value of the interest rate cap from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortized the initial value of the premium over the life of the contract. The premium amortization was recognized in interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Payment and amortization of the interest rate cap premium was included within prepaid expense and other current assets as well as other assets within cash flows from operating activities on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The derivative was considered highly effective through its expiration on June 28, 2024. In January 2024, the Company entered into a pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swap contract, with a fixed interest rate of per annum. Additionally, in February 2024, the Company entered into two pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swap contracts, with fixed interest rates of per annum. The contracts were executed in order to hedge the interest rate risk on a portion of the variable debt under the Credit Agreement. The Company receives variable amounts of interest from a counterparty at the greater of three-month SOFR or per annum and recognizes the amount reclassified into current earnings of the interest rate swaps in interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and

The Company estimates that million, before income taxes, of deferred gains recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 28, 2024 will be reclassified as a decrease in interest expense within the next 12 months. Actual amounts reclassified into net income during the next 12 months are dependent on changes in the three-month SOFR.)

Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with at or above investment grade credit ratings. This does not eliminate the Company s exposure to credit risk with these institutions; however, the Company s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company is not aware of any circumstance or condition that would preclude a counterparty from complying with the terms of the derivative contracts and will continuously monitor the credit worthiness of all its derivative counterparties for any significant adverse changes.

Any units that are forfeited, canceled, or reacquired by KC Parent prior to vesting are added back to the units available for issuance under the PIUs Plan. Class A-1 Units are fully vested upon issuance. Class B-1 Units vest over a period at per annum, subject to the service of the PIU Recipients with the Company, except in the event of an eligible retirement in which units remain outstanding and eligible to vest without regard for remaining service requirements. Upon the consummation of a sale of the Company, the vesting of all then nonvested Class B-1 Units accelerates in full. Class B-2 and Class B-3 Units vest on the date when certain performance-based vesting conditions are met, subject to the continued service of the PIU Recipients with the Company, except in the event of an eligible retirement. The performance conditions require raising distribution proceeds from the Company or from a third-party or transfer to securities in an aggregate amount equal to two times for Class B-2 Units or three times for Class B-3 Units of the Class A contribution amount and all other capital invested by KC Parent's limited partners. This condition is viewed as a substantive liquidity event performance-based vesting condition. For performance conditions, equity-based compensation expense is only recognized if the performance conditions become probable to be satisfied. T he Company has t recognized any performance-based vesting compensation expense for Class B-2 and Class B-3 Units as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 as the performance-based vesting conditions were not probable to be met. In March 2024, the PIUs Plan was modified. Refer to this note under the subsection titled "Equity-based Compensation Expense" for additional detail on how this modification was accounted for under ASC 718.

Stock options granted under the 2022 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Prior to the IPO, the 2022 Plan provides that the aggregate number of shares available for issuance pursuant to the awards shall be equal to the sum of (i) million shares and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending January 1, 2032 equal to the lesser of (A) of the number of shares outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Board. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events , for further information regarding the modification to the 2022 Plan that occurred subsequent to September 28, 2024. Stock Options The Company's stock options have time-based vesting schedules for which the awards generally vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining in equal quarterly installments over the following . The awards granted in May 2022 vest ratably over . terms and will expire and become unexercisable after the earliest of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the grant date, (ii) the ninetieth day following the Participant's termination of service for any reason other than due to death, disability, qualifying retirement, or for cause, (iii) immediately upon the termination of service of the Participant for cause, or (iv) the expiration of twelve months from the Participant's termination of service due to death or disability. In the event of qualifying retirement, the stock options will remain outstanding and eligible to vest in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Plan. In February 2023, the 2022 Plan was amended to provide for cash settlement of all stock options granted under the plan. As a result, stock options were remeasured at fair value and reclassified as liabilities at the modification date and are subject to remeasurement at fair value each reporting period following the modification date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized to reflect changes in the fair value of the liabilities to the extent that the fair value does not decrease below the grant date fair value of the awards.

The RSUs are subject to certain requirements including the Participant's continued service through the vesting date, as applicable. In the event of a Participant's termination of service, the Participant immediately forfeits any and all RSUs granted that have not vested or do not vest on the date termination of service occurs and rights in any such non-vested RSUs shall lapse and expire. Upon the occurrence of termination of service due to death or disability, the RSUs shall become vested in full. In the event of qualifying retirement, the RSUs will remain outstanding and eligible to vest in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Plan. In February 2023, the 2022 Plan was amended to provide for cash settlement of all RSUs granted under the plan, whereas prior to the amendment, half of the value of the RSUs were to be settled in cash and the other half were to be settled in shares.

Valuation Assumptions The Company estimates the grant date fair value of PIUs using a Monte Carlo Simulation model and estimates the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes model. The Monte Carlo Simulation model and Black-Scholes model require the use of highly complex and subjective assumptions. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much equity-based compensation expense is recognized.

Fair value of aggregate equity Prior to the Company s IPO, there was no public market for the equity of the Company, and therefore, the Company utilized a third-party valuation firm to determine estimates of fair value using generally accepted valuation methodologies, specifically income-based and market-based methods. The income-based method is the discounted cash flow method and the market methods include the guideline public company method and benchmarking against contemplated market transactions. Weightings are adjusted over time to reflect the merits and shortcomings of each method. Risk-free interest rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States constant maturity rates with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the PIUs and stock options. Expected dividend yield The Company does not expect to declare a dividend to shareholders in the foreseeable future. Expected term For PIUs, the Company calculates the expected term based on the expected time to a liquidity event. For stock options, the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method, which is based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding, generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options vesting term and contractual expiration period. The simplified method is used as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting service termination behavior. Expected volatility Prior to the Company s IPO, there was no specific historical or implied volatility information available. Accordingly, the Company estimated the expected volatility on the historical stock volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded over a period equivalent to the respective expected term of the PIUs and stock options. Equity-based Compensation Expense Total equity-based compensation expense for all equity-based compensation awards was million and million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and million and million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and was recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Equity-based compensation expense recognized during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 includes million in expense related to the March 2024 modification to the PIUs Plan. The income tax benefit related to equity-based compensation expense was million and million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and million and million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. In February 2023, the 2022 Plan was amended to provide for cash settlement of all stock options and RSUs granted under the plan. This modification impacted Participants with stock options and RSUs. Under ASC 718, a modification in the terms or conditions of an award, unless the change is non-substantive, represents an exchange of the original award for a new award. In the case of modifications that result in reclassification of the awards from equity to liabilities, the liability is remeasured at fair value every reporting period, with changes recognized as equity-based compensation expense to the extent that the fair value of the awards does not decrease below grant date fair value. Any change in the liability below the grant date fair value of the 

 21 

million reclassification from additional paid-in capital to other current and other long-term liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, at the time of modification, the Company recorded additional equity-based compensation expense of approximately million in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. In March 2024, the terms of the PIUs Plan were amended to provide for a March 2024 non-forfeitable distribution to 30 Class B PIU Recipients with PIUs outstanding at the time of modification, which will offset any future payments received by the PIU Recipients. Refer to Note 17, Related Party Transactions , for further information regarding the March 2024 distribution. This resulted in a Type I Modification (probable-to-probable) of the Class B-1 Units as the majority of the Class B-1 Units are vested with the remainder probable to vest both immediately before and after modification. The Class B-1 Units were measured at fair value on the modification date immediately before and after the modification. The cash distribution exceeded the reduction in fair value when comparing the value immediately before and after the modification by million. As the distribution is non-forfeitable and does not require any additional services to be provided by the PIU Recipients, the Company recognized the million as equity-based compensation expense within selling, general, and administrative expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The March 2024 modification also resulted in a Type IV Modification (improbable-to-improbable) of the Class B-2 and Class B-3 Units as the distribution to Class B-2 and Class B-3 PIU Recipients did not meet the liquidity event performance-based vesting conditions and therefore the units were not probable to vest both immediately before and after modification. No performance-based vesting compensation expense has been or will be recognized related to the Class B-2 and Class B-3 Units until the performance-based vesting conditions are met, at which time, in accordance with the guidance for Type IV modifications under ASC 718, expense will be recognized based on the post-modification fair value. However, the distribution to Class B-2 and Class B-3 PIU Recipients is non-forfeitable even if a liquidity event does not occur and thus the distribution represents compensation in excess of the rights and privileges provided to Class B-2 and Class B-3 PIU Recipients under the PIUs Plan. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , the Company recognized million as equity-based compensation expense within selling, general, and administrative expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the distribution to Class B-2 and Class B-3 PIU Recipients. equity-based compensation expense related to the March 2024 modification was recognized during the three months ended September 28, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, the total unrecognized equity-based compensation expense for Class B-1 Units, stock options, and RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was million, which will be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of years. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation expense for Class B-2 and Class B-3 Units as of September 28, 2024 was million, which will be recognized once certain respective performance hurdles are achieved. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events , for further information regarding modifications to equity-based compensation plans that occurred subsequent to September 28, 2024 .

Vested stock options under the 2022 Plan are contractually participating securities because option holders have a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends when the Company exceeds a stated distributable amount. The stated distributable amount was not met during both the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and therefore, the stock options were not considered as participating in undistributed earnings in the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share for the periods. Prior to the February 2023 amendment to the 2022 Plan, there were million shares of common stock from outstanding stock options that were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Due to the reclassification of all equity-classified stock options and RSUs to liability-classified as a result of the February 2023 amendment to the 2022 Plan, the Company no longer has share-settled stock options or RSUs, and therefore, there were anti-dilutive shares of common stock from outstanding stock options to exclude from the calculation of diluted net income per common share subsequent to the amendment. In October 2024, the 2022 Plan was further amended to provide for share-settlement of all unexercised stock options and unvested RSUs, and as a result, the liability-classified awards were reclassified as equity in accordance with ASC 718. Refer to Note 18, Subsequent Events , for further information. 

 and for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and and for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rate for both the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by federal tax credits. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the partial release of the receivable related to uncertain tax positions as a result of the portion of ERC recognized, tax expense from equity-based compensation, and state income taxes. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by state income taxes. Due to the unprecedented nature of ERC legislation and the changing administrative guidance, the Company recorded a million receivable related to uncertain tax positions in December 2022 when applying for the ERC. As of December 30, 2023, the Company's receivable related to uncertain tax positions was million within other assets, and as of September 28, 2024, the Company reduced the receivable to million and million within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets in connection with the portion of ERC recognized during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence when assessing the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets. Evidence includes the anticipated impact on future taxable income arising from the reversal of temporary differences, actual operating results for the trailing twelve quarters, the ongoing assessment of financial performance, and available tax planning strategies, if any, that management considers prudent and feasible. valuation allowance was required as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. The Company will continue to reassess the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets. The Company is no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2012.

The KC Parent, LP Agreement modified the PIUs Plan to allow for the March 2024 distribution. In March 2024, KC Parent paid a million distribution to Class A Unit holders and a million distribution to PIU Recipients with units outstanding as of the date of modification pursuant to the KC Parent, LP Agreement and PIUs Plan. Refer to Note 13, Shareholder s Equity and Equity-Based Compensation.

shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share and shares of common stock with a par value of per share. Modification of 2022 Plan On September 20, 2024, the Company s Board approved an amendment to the 2022 Plan which became effective on October 8, 2024, after the effectiveness of the Company s registration statement on Form S-1 for its IPO. In response to the Common Stock Conversion, the amendment provides that the aggregate number of shares available for issuance pursuant to the awards shall be equal to the sum of (i) shares and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2026 and ending January 1, 2034 equal to the lesser of (A) of the number of shares outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Board. Additionally, subsequent to the amendment, all unexercised stock options and unvested RSUs will be settled in shares when stock options are exercised and RSUs vest according to their original vesting schedules. As a result, the liability-classified awards will be reclassified as equity within additional paid-in capital as of the modification date and the Company will not remeasure the awards at fair value each reporting period during the remaining vesting period in accordance with equity-classification under ASC 718. This modification will impact Participants and will not result in incremental compensation expense. Liquidating Distribution and Modification of PIUs Plan On October 8, 2024, pursuant to the KC Parent, LP Agreement, the board of managers and the General Partner of KC Parent approved a plan of dissolution and liquidation of KC Parent whereby KC Parent may distribute shares of the Company s common stock to the limited partners of KC Parent in lieu of liquidating its assets for cash in connection with an IPO. As of the date of the IPO, the sole assets of KC Parent consisted of shares of the Company s common stock and the fair value of such shares was per share. KC Parent's shares of the Company's common stock were allocated to each of the capital accounts of its limited partners, including PIUs held by PIU Recipients, based on their respective ownership. KC Parent then distributed the shares of the Company s common stock to its limited partners (the Liquidating Distribution ). The Company expects the Liquidating Distribution to result in a modification to the PIUs Plan under ASC 718, and as such, the Company will recognize equity-based compensation expense within selling, general, and administrative expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income on the date of the modification. Initial Public Offering On October 8, 2024, an underwriting agreement was executed in which the Company agreed to sell shares of common stock to the underwriters based on an initial public offering price of per share. The Company received net proceeds of million, or per share after underwriting discounts and commissions, on October 10, 2024, when the shares were issued and the initial offering closed. Additionally, on October 10, 2024, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase up to additional shares of common stock based on the initial offering price of per share. The net proceeds of million, after underwriting discounts and commissions, were received by the Company on October 15, 2024, when the sale was completed. The total net proceeds from the initial offering and underwriters option, less approximately million in direct offering costs incurred in connection with the IPO, will be recorded to common stock and additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets following the IPO. IPO Launch Grants under 2022 Plan On October 9, 2024, the Company granted equity-based compensation awards to certain employees in connection with the IPO including RSUs granted to highly-tenured teachers with a service-based vesting condition, and RSUs and stock options granted to other employees that will vest ratably over a period. These grants were issued post-Common Stock Conversion at a grant date fair value of for RSUs and for stock options. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On October 9, 2024, the Board adopted and approved the Company's 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") which permits eligible employees of the Company to purchase shares of common stock at periodic intervals. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that will initially be reserved for issuance under the ESPP shall be equal to the sum of (i) million shares and (ii) an annual increase beginning on January 1, 2026 and ending January 1, 2034 by an amount equal to the 

 25 

of the shares outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such smaller number of shares as determined by the board of directors; provided that in no event will more than million shares of the Company s common stock be available for issuance under the ESPP. Termination of Management Services Agreement In connection with the completion of the IPO on October 10, 2024, the Management Services Agreement with Partners Group was terminated in accordance with its terms. First Lien Revolving Credit Facility Amendment On October 10, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility by million to million and extend the maturity date of million of the facility (the Revolving Extended Tranche Commitments ), inclusive of million of commitments prior to the amendment, to the earlier of October 2029 or 91 days prior to the First Lien Term Loan Facility maturity date Springing Maturity Date ), unless on or prior to the Springing Maturity Date, the Company repays, repurchases, or redeems, in full, the First Lien Term Loan Facility (collectively, the RCF Amendment ). The maturity date of the remaining million of non-extended commitments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility was unchanged from June 2028. Additionally, pursuant to the RCF Amendment, the cap on the amount of letters of credit that can be drawn against the borrowing capacity of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility increased to million. Repayment and Repricing of First Lien Term Loan On October 30, 2024, the Company repaid million of outstanding principal on the First Lien Term Loan Facility utilizing the net proceeds from the IPO, reducing the principal balance to million, and, in conjunction, entered into a repricing amendment to the Credit Agreement ("Repricing Amendment"). As of the effective date of the Repricing Amendment, the First Lien Term Loan Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus per annum. Additionally, amounts drawn under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable rate between and per annum, and fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit bear interest at an applicable rate between and per annum, based on a pricing grid of the Company s First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. The Repricing Amendment decreased the required quarterly principal payments on the First Lien Term Loan Facility to million, beginning with the payment due for the quarter ended March 29, 2025 . All other terms under the Credit Agreement remain unchanged. The Company expects to recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the repayment of a portion of the First Lien Term Loan Facility.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on October 9, 2024, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act ("Prospectus"). Some of the information included in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and "Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Our Company 
 KinderCare Learning Companies, Inc. ("the Company," "we," "us," and "our") is the largest private provider of high-quality early childhood education ("ECE") in the United States by center capacity. We are a mission-driven organization, rooted in a commitment to providing all children with the very best start in life. We serve children ranging from six weeks to 12 years of age across our market-leading footprint of 1,573 early childhood education centers with center capacity for 210,972 children and 1,018 before- and after-school sites located in 40 states and the District of Columbia as of September 28, 2024. 
 On October 8, 2024, our registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-281971) ("Form S-1") related to our initial public offering ("IPO"), was declared effective by the SEC, and our initial offering was completed on October 10, 2024. In connection with our IPO, the Company converted Class A and Class B common stock, both with a par value of 0.0001 per share, to common stock, with a par value of 0.01 per share, at a ratio of 8.375 shares of Class A and Class B common stock to one share of common stock, which became effective immediately following the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 for our IPO ("Common Stock Conversion"). As a result, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of September 28, 2024 have been adjusted to retrospectively reflect the Common Stock Conversion. Refer to Note 1 and Note 18 within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Factors Affecting Results of Operations 
 The following factors, among others described herein, have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods: 
 Increase revenues through improved occupancy and consistent price increases . Our future revenue growth is in part dependent on us continuing to grow revenues across our portfolio of centers. We invest in developing our brand, which has become widely recognized in the ECE market. Although we expect marketing activities to increase our cost of services, we expect them to positively impact our results of operations in the future. 

Occupancy improvement: We aim to improve occupancy rates across our portfolio. Historically, we increased our average occupancy through a combination of strategic investments in technology and talent, as well as implementing best practices at our centers. We invest significant resources into our technology infrastructure to support our center and site operations and interactions with families. As our occupancy grows, we have an opportunity to gain further operating leverage and improve profitability as we allocate fixed costs over more enrollments. 
 Pricing model designed for continued growth: We expect to implement regular price increases to support center re-investment and enhance our operational performance. Tuition increases are standard across the industry, and we view them as a reliable component of our business model. Additionally, while we expect rates to increase each year, the out-of-pocket costs paid by parents with children who continue to enroll in our programs decline on an annual basis as tuition costs decrease as children age-up (e.g., three-year olds have lower tuition costs than two-year olds). Assuming consistent enrollment across ages, tuition increases have an immediate positive impact to revenue. 
 Expand footprint through greenfield development and strategic acquisitions . Our long-term revenue growth depends on the expansion of our footprint, either through opening new greenfield centers or acquiring centers. We have a rigorous integration approach to transition acquired centers into our portfolio that allow us to deliver a consistent level of quality, as expected by our clients and accreditors. Given the significant fragmentation in our industry, we expect to continue to 

27 

pursue acquisitions complementary to our existing portfolio. Expansion will require cash investment, but we anticipate a long-term increase in both revenue and profit. 

Develop and nurture other revenue streams and expand service offerings . Supporting services adjacent to our ECE business provide diversification and drives incremental revenue. Leveraging our employer relationships, our business-to-business offerings, which include tuition benefits programs and employer-sponsored centers, are poised for growth as employers are increasingly recognizing the importance of supporting their employees with access to quality ECE programs. In the before- and after-school programs market we have contracts with approximately 1 of the over 90,000 K-12 schools in the United States, providing significant opportunity to continue to grow our footprint. 

Access to governmental funding and advocacy to support the ECE industry. We receive various forms of federal, state, and local governmental funding to support our operations and serve more families including reimbursements for food costs through the federal Child and Adult Food Care Program as well as grants for capital purchases, teacher compensation, and other center operating costs. In addition, we proactively work with prospective and current families to help them access public subsidy funding. As a market leader, we believe we are well positioned to advocate for continued and increased government support for the broader ECE industry. 

Adapt to changes in seasonal demand for child care and other services. Enrollments at centers and before- and after-school sites are generally higher in the spring and fall back-to-school period and lower during the summer and calendar year-end holidays when families may be on vacation or utilizing alternative child care arrangements. As a result, the number of open sites may decrease at the end of the second quarter as many sites close temporarily for the summer, and revenue at centers and sites may decline during the third quarter, which overlaps with most of the summer season. To adapt to the changes in seasonal demand, centers offer summer programs and Champions offers day camps for school-age children during the summer and calendar year-end holidays. 

Key Performance Metrics 
 Total centers and sites 
 We measure and track the number of centers and sites because, as our number of centers and sites grow, it highlights our geographic expansion and potential growth in revenue. We believe this information is useful to investors as an indicator of revenue growth and operational expansion and can be used to measure and track our performance over time. We define the number of centers as the number of centers at the beginning of the period plus openings and acquisitions, minus any permanent closures for the period. A permanently closed center is a center that has ceased operations as of the end of the reporting period and management does not intend on reopening the center. We define the number of sites as total sites that were operational in the last month of the period, which reflects the seasonal impacts of temporary closures at the beginning of summer.

During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, total centers increased by 16 due to acquiring 16 centers and opening 10 centers, partially offset by 10 permanent center closures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total centers decreased by two due to 13 permanent center closures, partially offset by opening nine centers and acquiring two centers. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 1,018 before- and after-school sites, an increase of 77 sites from 941 before- and after-school sites as of September 30, 2023. Total before- and after-school sites increased by 70 during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 due to opening 155 sites, partially offset by 85 site closures. Total before- and after-school sites increased by 153 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of opening 204 sites, partially offset by 51 site closures. 
 Average weekly ECE FTEs 
 Average weekly ECE full-time enrollment ("FTEs") is a measure of the number of full-time children enrolled and charged tuition weekly in our centers. We calculate average weekly ECE FTEs based on weighted averages; for example, an enrolled full-time child equates to one average weekly ECE FTE, while a child enrolled for three full days equates to 0.6 average weekly ECE FTE. This 
 28 

metric is used by management and we believe is useful to investors as it is the key driver of revenue generated and variable costs incurred in our operations.

 Average weekly ECE FTEs for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were relatively consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 ECE same-center occupancy 
 ECE same-center occupancy is a measure of the utilization of center capacity. We define same-center to be centers that have been operated by us for at least 12 months as of the period end date, or in other words, centers that are starting their second year of operation. Excluded from same-centers are any closed centers at the end of the reporting period and any new or acquired centers that have not yet met the same-center criteria. We calculate ECE same-center occupancy as the average weekly ECE same-center full-time enrollment divided by the total of the ECE same-centers capacity during the period. Center capacity is determined by regulatory and operational parameters and can fluctuate due to changes in these parameters, such as changing center structures to meet the demands of enrollment or changes in regulatory standards. This metric is used by management and we believe is useful to investors as it measures the utilization of our centers capacity in generating revenue.

ECE same-center revenue increased by 68.9 million, or 12.6 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cr me School centers, acquired in fiscal 2022 and classified as same-centers as of September 28, 2024, accounted for 30.3 million of the ECE same-center revenue growth. Additionally, 22.8 million, or 4.2 , of the ECE same-center revenue growth was driven by centers that were classified as same-centers as of both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 11.2 million of the ECE same-center revenue growth was due to the timing of registration fee billing in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The remaining 4.6 million increase in ECE same-center revenue growth was driven by the net impact of new and acquired centers, other than Cr me School centers, not yet classified as same-centers as of September 30, 2023 and center closures as of September 28, 2024.

ECE same-center revenue increased by 188.2 million, or 11.3 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cr me School centers, acquired in fiscal 2022 and classified as same-centers as of September 28, 2024, accounted for 94.1 million of the ECE same-center revenue growth. Additionally, 82.0 million, or 5.0 , of the ECE same-center revenue growth was driven by centers that were classified as same-centers as of both September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The remaining 12.0 million increase in ECE same-center revenue growth was driven by the net impact of new and acquired centers, other than Cr me School centers, not yet classified as same-centers as of September 30, 2023 and center closures as of September 28, 2024. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue is derived primarily from tuition charged for providing early childhood education and care services at our centers and sites. The majority of tuition is paid by individual families and may be partially subsidized by amounts received from government agencies or employer sponsors. Subsidy revenue from government agencies was 242.6 million and 201.4 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 699.8 million and 596.0 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) 
 Our cost of services includes the direct costs related to the operation of our centers and sites and excludes depreciation and impairment. Cost of services consists primarily of personnel costs, rent, food, costs of operating and maintaining facilities, taxes and licenses, marketing, transportation, classroom and office supplies, and insurance. Offsetting certain center operating expenses are reimbursements from federal, state, and local agencies. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Our depreciation and amortization includes depreciation relating to centers and sites, field management, and corporate facilities as well as amortization related to finance lease right-of-use assets and definite-lived intangibles, such as client relationships, trade names and trademarks, covenants not-to-compete, and software. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses include costs, primarily personnel related, associated with field management, corporate oversight, and support of our centers and sites. 
 Impairment losses 
 Our impairment losses relate to property and equipment, operating right-of-use assets, and definite-lived intangible assets. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense includes long-term debt interest, gain or loss on interest rate derivatives, amortization of debt issuance costs, and financing lease interest. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income includes interest earned on cash held in interest-bearing accounts. 
 Other (income) expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net includes sub-lease income, miscellaneous insurance proceeds, contract settlements, realized and unrealized gains and losses related to investment trust assets, and other gains and losses. 
 30 

Income tax expense (benefit) 
 Income taxes primarily consist of an estimate of federal and state income taxes based on enacted federal and state tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, differences between GAAP and tax income and deductions, and the tax effect from uncertain tax positions, as applicable. 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations 
 As a result of certain factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations. 
 COVID-19 Related Stimulus 
 During 2020 and 2021, the United States government approved several incremental stimulus funding programs for ECE providers in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic, and as a result, we have received grants in the form of revenue or cost reimbursements ("COVID-19 Related Stimulus"). We recognized 16.9 million and 36.9 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 55.9 million and 145.2 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, in funding for reimbursement of center operating expenses in cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment), as well as 0.2 million and 1.4 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 0.3 million and 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, in revenue arising from COVID-19 Related Stimulus. The programs funding the COVID-19 Related Stimulus are required to distribute all stimulus funding by December 31, 2024, and we do not expect future funding after that date. The variability of funding provided by COVID-19 Related Stimulus has impacted the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented, and the conclusion of the programs will have an impact on the comparability of future periods. 
 The Employee Retention Credit ERC ), established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and extended and expanded by several subsequent governmental acts, allows eligible businesses to claim a per employee payroll tax credit based on a percentage of qualified wages, including health care expenses, paid during calendar year 2020 through September 2021. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we applied for ERC for qualified wages and benefits paid throughout the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021. Reimbursements of 62.0 million in cash tax refunds for ERC claimed, along with 2.3 million in interest income, were received during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Due to the unprecedented nature of ERC legislation and the changing administrative guidance, not all of the ERC reimbursements received have met our recognition criteria. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recognized 23.4 million of ERC in cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment), along with 0.5 million in interest income. No ERC was recognized during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The timing in recognition of ERC has impacted the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented, and recognition of the remaining deferred ERC liabilities will have an impact on the comparability of future periods.

7.5 

Total revenue increased by 47.0 million, or 7.5 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue from early childhood education centers increased by 40.5 million, or 6.9 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately 6 was from higher tuition rates and approximately 1 was attributable to increased enrollment. Revenue from early childhood education centers for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was higher by 10.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the timing of registration fee billing in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 The increase in revenue from early childhood education centers was driven by an increase in higher ECE same-center revenue. Excluding centers that became classified as same-centers after September 30, 2023, which primarily relates to Cr me Schools, ECE same-center growth was 34.0 million. New and acquired centers not yet classified as same-centers contributed 9.1 million in revenue during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Revenue from before- and after-school sites increased by 6.5 million, or 16.8 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to opening new sites, offering more summer day camps, and increased tuition rates. 
 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) 
 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) increased by 52.7 million, or 11.2 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a 20.0 million decrease in reimbursements from COVID-19 Related Stimulus recognized due to the conclusion of certain stimulus funding. The increase was also attributable to higher personnel costs of 18.0 million due to wage rate and labor hour increases, partially offset by lower grant related bonuses. Additionally, other cost of services increased by 9.9 million primarily as a result of increased marketing spend and insurance costs, and rent expense increased 4.9 million due to new centers. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 2.6 million, or 9.5 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 2.6 million as a result of additional capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 as well as depreciation of property and equipment at acquired and new centers. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 3.4 million, or 4.9 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven by lower personnel costs of 1.8 million due to lower bonus reserve, partially offset by higher compensation expense on our deferred compensation plan. The decrease was also attributable to 1.7 million lower professional fees incurred as a result of investments in talent and transformational initiatives in fiscal 2023. 
 Impairment losses 
 Impairment losses decreased by 0.5 million, or 29.2 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by fewer centers with property and equipment impairment during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 33 

Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased by 1.0 million, or 2.6 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by 4.7 million in higher interest on long-term debt as a result of entering into an incremental first lien term loan in March 2024, partially offset by a 3.1 million decrease due to income recognized on our three pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swap agreements during the three months ended September 28, 2024. Additionally, this increase was partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased by 0.3 million, or 20.3 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower cash balances held in interest-bearing accounts during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Other (income) expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net increased by 2.7 million, or 370.5 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 2.8 million net change in realized and unrealized holding gains on our deferred compensation plan investment trust assets. See Note 1 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements included in the Prospectus for further information regarding our deferred compensation plan. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense decreased by 0.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 22.9 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 24.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rates for both the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by the relative impact that federal tax credits had on current and prior period activity.

Total revenue increased by 123.9 million, or 6.5 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue from early childhood education centers increased by 98.1 million, or 5.5 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately 5 was from higher tuition rates while enrollment remained relatively consistent. 
 The increase in revenue from early childhood education centers was driven by an increase in higher ECE same-center revenue. Excluding centers that became classified as same-centers after September 30, 2023, which primarily relates to Cr me Schools, ECE same-center growth was 82.0 million. New and acquired centers not yet classified as same-centers contributed 21.5 million in revenue during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Revenue from before- and after-school sites increased by 25.8 million, or 21.9 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to opening new sites, increased tuition rates, and offering more summer day camps. 
 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) 
 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) increased by 161.5 million, or 11.9 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a 89.3 million 
 34 

decrease in reimbursements from COVID-19 Related Stimulus recognized due to the conclusion of certain stimulus funding. The increase was also attributable to higher personnel costs of 63.0 million due to wage rate and labor hour increases as well as benefits cost increases, partially offset by lower grant related bonuses. Additionally, other cost of services increased by 22.2 million primarily as a result of increased insurance costs and marketing spend, and rent expense increased 10.4 million due to new centers. These increases were partially offset by 23.4 million in ERC recognized during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 6.8 million, or 8.5 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 7.2 million as a result of additional capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 as well as depreciation of property and equipment at acquired and new centers, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in amortization expense driven by intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal 2023. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 13.6 million, or 6.1 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by a 8.4 million increase in equity-based compensation expense as a result of the March 2024 distribution to certain employees, officers, managers, directors, and other providers of services to KC Parent, LP ("KC Parent") and its subsidiaries with outstanding profit interest units (collectively, PIU Recipients related to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PIUs Plan"), partially offset by the remeasurement of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options to fair value each reporting period as a result of the awards becoming liability-classified in fiscal 2023. Additionally, we incurred 5.7 million higher meetings and travel expense attributable to our field leadership summit held during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and 4.7 million in costs related to our transition to an integrated cloud-based enterprise resource planning system, primarily within computer costs, personnel costs, and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by 3.7 million lower professional, legal, and recruiting fees incurred as a result of investments in talent and transformational initiatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Impairment losses 
 Impairment losses increased by 0.1 million, or 0.8 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by 1.0 million higher right-of-use asset impairment from centers with lower cash flow projections, partially offset by 1.0 million lower property and equipment impairment due to fewer centers with property and equipment impairment during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased by 5.4 million, or 4.8 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by 14.1 million in higher interest on long-term debt as a result of entering into an incremental first lien term loan in March 2024, partially offset by a 4.5 million decrease due to income recognized on our three pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swap agreements during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to expense recognized on our interest rate cap agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, this increase was partially offset by a 4.2 million decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income increased by 1.0 million, or 24.3 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher average interest rates on cash balances held in interest-bearing accounts during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Other (income) expense, net 
 Other (income) expense, net increased by 4.0 million, or 231.7 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 2.5 million net change in realized and unrealized holding gains on our deferred compensation plan investment trust assets. The increase was also attributable to a 1.5 million gain recognized from insurance claims. See Note 1 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements included in the Prospectus for further information regarding our deferred compensation plan. 
 35 

Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense decreased by 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 31.7 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 25.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the partial release of the receivable related to uncertain tax positions as a result of the portion of ERC recognized, tax expense from equity-based compensation, and state income taxes. Compared to the statutory rate, the difference in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by state income taxes. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we also provide the below non-GAAP financial measures. EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per common share (collectively referred to as the non-GAAP financial measures are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, income or loss from operations, or any other performance measure in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Consequently, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We present EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per common share because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are useful to securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) allow for an assessment of our operating performance without the effect of charges that do not relate to the core operations of our business. 
 EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per common share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness; 

they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash requirements for income tax liabilities; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per common share do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; 

they do not reflect our cash used for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital; and 

other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 

EBIT, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBIT is defined as net income adjusted for interest and income tax expense (benefit). EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for impairment losses, equity-based compensation, management and advisory fee expenses, acquisition related costs, non-recurring distribution and bonus expense, COVID-19 Related Stimulus, net, and other costs because these charges do not relate to the core operations of our business. We present EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are useful to securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties. We believe adjusted EBITDA is helpful to investors in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per common share 
 Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), amortization of intangible assets, impairment losses, equity-based compensation, management and advisory fee expenses, acquisition related costs, non-recurring distribution and bonus expense, COVID-19 Related Stimulus, net, other costs, and non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) because these charges do not relate to the core operations of our business. Adjusted net income (loss) per common share is defined as the amount of adjusted net income (loss) per weighted average number of common shares outstanding. We present adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per common share because we consider them to be important measures used to evaluate our operating performance internally. We believe the use of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per common share provides investors with consistency in the evaluation of the Company as they offer a meaningful comparison of past, present, and future operating results, as well as more useful financial comparisons to our peers. We believe these supplemental measures can be used to assess the financial performance of our business without regard to certain costs that are not representative of our continuing operations.

Explanation of add backs: 
 (1) Represents impairment charges for long-lived assets as a result of center closures and reduced operating performance at certain centers due to the impact of changing demographics in certain locations in which we operate and current macroeconomic conditions on our overall operations. 

(2) Represents non-cash equity-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718, Compensation: Stock Compensation . 

(3) Represents amounts incurred for management and advisory fees with related parties in connection with a management services agreement with Partners Group (USA), Inc., a related party of the Company s ultimate parent, which was terminated upon completion of our IPO. 

(4) Represents costs incurred in connection with planned and completed acquisitions, including due diligence, transaction, integration, and severance related costs. During the periods presented, these costs were incurred related to the acquisition of Cr me School. 

(5) During March 2024, we recognized a 14.3 million one-time expense related to an advance distribution to Class B PIU Recipients. In connection with this distribution, we recognized a 5.0 million one-time bonus expense for RSU and stock options to certain service providers, which are defined as employees, consultants, or directors (collectively, Participants"), to account for the change in value associated with the March 2024 distribution to PIU Recipients. We do not routinely make distributions to PIU Recipients in advance of a liquidity event or pay bonuses to RSU or stock option Participants outside of normal vesting and we do not expect to do so in the future. 

(6) Includes expense reimbursements and revenue arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, net of pass-through expenses incurred as a result of certain grant requirements. We recognized 16.9 million and 36.9 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 55.9 million and 145.2 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, in funding for reimbursement of center operating expenses in cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment), as well as 0.2 million and 1.4 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and 

38 

September 30, 2023, and 0.3 million and 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, in revenue arising from COVID-19 Related Stimulus. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recognized 23.4 million of ERC offsetting cost of services (excluding depreciation and impairment) as well as 2.6 million in professional fees in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a result of calculating and filing for ERC. COVID-19 Related Stimulus is net of pass-through expenses incurred as stipulated within certain grants of 2.3 million and 6.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 11.4 million and 21.3 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

(7) Other costs include certain professional fees incurred for both contemplated and completed debt and equity transactions, as well as costs expensed in connection with prior contemplated offerings. For the three months ended September 28, 2024, other costs include expenses incurred, offset by a refund for costs expensed in a prior period resulting in a net credit to expense, for professional fees incurred as a result of our IPO. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other costs include expenses incurred related to a contemplated equity transaction. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, other costs includes 2.9 million in transaction costs associated with our incremental first lien term loan and repricing on our 1,750.0 million senior secured credit facilities and 0.7 million in costs related to our IPO. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other costs includes 6.3 million in transaction costs associated with our June 2023 refinancing. These costs represent items management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. 

(8) Includes the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate federal and state statutory tax rate for each adjustment. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8 for both the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Our statutory rate is re-evaluated at least annually. 

(9) The outstanding shares and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Common Stock Conversion. Refer to Note 1 and Note 18 within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of cash are cash provided by operations, current cash balances, and borrowings available under a 160.0 million revolving credit facility (the "First Lien Revolving Credit Facility"). Our principal uses of cash are payments of our operating expenses, such as personnel salaries and benefits, debt service, rents paid to landlords, and capital expenditures. 
 We expect to continue to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions with cash generated from operations, cash on hand, and to the extent necessary and available, through borrowings under the credit agreement, dated as of June 12, 2023 (as subsequently amended and restated) (the "Credit Agreement"). If the need arises for additional expenditures, we may seek additional funding. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors. We have incurred significant expenses during our transition to a public company that we had not previously incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as well as the corporate governance standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the New York Stock Exchange. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or debt financing arrangements. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
 Debt facilities 
 As of September 28, 2024, our Credit Agreement consists of a 1,590.0 million first lien term loan ("First Lien Term Loan Facility") and a 160.0 million First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 In March 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement for a 265.0 million incremental first lien term loan. The amendment increased the required quarterly principal payments on the First Lien Term Loan Facility to 4.0 million from 3.3 million, beginning with the payment due for the quarter ended March 30, 2024. All other terms under the Credit Agreement remained unchanged. 
 In April 2024, we entered into a repricing amendment to the Credit Agreement for the First Lien Term Loan Facility and the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, including fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit. As of the effective date of the amendment, the First Lien Term Loan Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 4.50 per annum. Additionally, as of the effective date of the amendment, amounts drawn under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable rate between 4.00 and 4.50 per annum, and fees on the outstanding balance of letters of 
 39 

credit bear interest at an applicable rate between 4.00 and 4.50 per annum, based on a pricing grid of our First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. All other terms under the Credit Agreement remained unchanged. 
 On October 10, 2024, subsequent to the end of the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility by 80.0 million to 240.0 million and extend the maturity date of 225.0 million of the facility (the Revolving Extended Tranche Commitments to the earlier of October 2029 or 91 days prior to the First Lien Term Loan Facility maturity date (the "Springing Maturity Date"), unless on or prior to the Springing Maturity Date, the Company repays, repurchases, or redeems, in full, the First Lien Term Loan Facility. Additionally, the cap on the amount of letters of credit that can be drawn against the borrowing capacity of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility increased to 172.5 million. The maturity date of the remaining 15.0 million of non-extended commitments was unchanged from June 2028. 
 On October 30, 2024, we repaid 608.0 million of outstanding principal on the First Lien Term Loan Facility utilizing the net proceeds from our IPO, reducing the principal balance to 966.8 million, and, in conjunction, entered into a repricing amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Repricing Amendment"). As of the effective date of the Repricing Amendment, the First Lien Term Loan Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 3.25 per annum. Additionally, amounts drawn under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable rate between 2.75 and 3.25 per annum, and fees on the outstanding balance of letters of credit bear interest at an applicable rate between 2.75 and 3.25 per annum, based on a pricing grid of our First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio. The Repricing Amendment decreased the required quarterly principal payments on the First Lien Term Loan Facility to 2.4 million, beginning with the payment due for the quarter ended March 29, 2025. All other terms under the Credit Agreement remain unchanged. 
 As of September 28, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility and 55.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 The interest rate effective as of September 28, 2024 was 9.83 on the First Lien Term Loan Facility, 4.00 on outstanding letters of credit, and 0.25 on the unused portion of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The weighted average interest rate during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 for the First Lien Term Loan Facility was 10.11 . 
 All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and nonfinancial loan covenants and provisions. 
 Under the Credit Agreement the financial loan covenant is a quarterly maximum First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be tested only if, on the last day of each fiscal quarter, the amount of revolving loans outstanding on the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility (excluding all letters of credit) exceeds 35 of total revolving commitments on such date. As this threshold was not met as of September 28, 2024 the quarterly maximum First Lien Term Loan Facility net leverage ratio financial covenant was not in effect. Nonfinancial loan covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt; make fundamental changes to the business; make certain restricted payments, investments, acquisitions, and dispositions; or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
 The First Lien Term Loan Facility matures in June 2030 and the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility matures in June 2028. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement. 
 In February 2024, we entered into a credit facilities agreement, dated as of February 1, 2024, which allows for 20.0 million in letters of credit to be issued ("LOC Agreement"). We pay an interest rate of 5.95 on any outstanding balance and 0.25 on any unused portion. The LOC Agreement matures in December 2026. Upon entering into the LOC Agreement, we issued 20.0 million in letters of credit and cancelled 16.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 28, 2024, there were 20.0 million outstanding letters of credit under the LOC Agreement. 
 We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 See Note 10 and Note 18 of our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our debt facilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by 151.0 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, decreased by 37.1 million primarily due to lower cost reimbursements from COVID-19 Related Stimulus recognized, partially offset by revenue growth. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a 114.0 million decrease in cash primarily due to deferred recognition of ERC and collections on grants receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by higher accrued interest expense due to the timing of interest payments during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities increased by 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by 6.7 million in higher payments for acquisitions and 4.8 million in higher capital expenditures. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased by 60.7 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 264.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of an incremental first lien term loan during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as well as the 115.8 million net impact of our June 2023 refinancing during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were partially offset by the 320.0 million March 2024 distribution to KC Parent during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Cash requirements 
 As of September 28, 2024, we have cash requirements for leases, long-term debt payments and other liabilities. For lease related information, see Note 7 of our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we have the following obligations: 
 Long-term debt obligations, including interest, of 2.5 billion are expected to be paid out as follows: 45.1 million for the remainder of 2024, 372.1 million in two to three years, 323.9 million in four to five years, and 1.7 billion thereafter through June 2030 when the First Lien Term Loan Facility matures. 

Self-insurance obligations of 66.9 million are expected to be paid out as claims are settled and cash outflows cannot be estimated reliably. 

Deferred compensation plan of 37.2 million is expected to be paid out based on the individual plan participant and cash outflows cannot be estimated reliably. 

Promissory notes, including interest, of 0.8 million are expected to be paid out as follows: 0.1 million for the remainder of 2024, 0.6 million in two to three years, and 0.1 million in four to five years. 

Other liabilities of 4.3 million is comprised of various payables expected to be paid out based on the contractual terms. 

41 

Service arrangements which include certain information technology, labor software, and maintenance services of 48.8 million are expected to be paid out as follows: 6.2 million for the remainder of 2024, 17.7 million in two to three years, 7.5 million in four to five years, and 17.4 million thereafter. 

Certain agreements may have cancellation penalties for which, if we were to cancel, we would be required to pay up to approximately 4.8 million. Other cancellation penalties cannot be estimated as we cannot predict the occurrence of future agreement cancellations. See Note 11 and Note 14 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements included in the Prospectus for additional detail related to our contractual obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements are, in some cases, estimates based on our management s judgment and input from actuaries and other third parties and are developed from information available at the time. We evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual outcomes may vary from the estimates, and changes, if any, are reflected in current period earnings. 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies described within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Prospectus. For a description of our other significant accounting policies, see Note 1 in both our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and audited consolidated annual financial statements included in the Prospectus. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our results of operations or financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had 1.5 billion of variable-rate debt, net of debt issuance costs. We estimate that had the average interest rates on our borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense would have increased by approximately 2.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 and approximately 6.0 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, net of the effects of our interest rate derivatives. 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk and may use derivatives to manage variable interest rates on the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility and the First Lien Term Loan Facility. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We may enter into interest rate derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , to effectively convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. In October 2022, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement that commenced in December 2022 and matured in June 2024 in order to hedge interest rate risk on a portion of the variable-rate debt of our prior 1,200.0 million first lien term loan facility, which was repaid in full in connection with the June 2023 refinancing. We paid an initial 5.0 million premium for the interest rate cap, which we amortized over the life of the contract. Under the interest rate cap, we received variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rose above the strike rate on the contract. The interest rate hedged under the interest rate cap was modified from the London Interbank Offered Rate to SOFR contemporaneously with our June 2023 refinancing in connection with reference rate reform. We elected to adopt an optional expedient available under ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform , which allowed a hedging relationship to continue, in light of a change in critical terms, without de-designation of the hedge. The derivative's notional amount was 659.8 million immediately prior to its expiration on June 28, 2024 and was considered highly effective through its expiration. In January 2024, we entered into a pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swap with a notional amount of 400.0 million and a fixed interest rate of 3.85 per annum. Additionally, in February 2024, we entered into two pay-fixed-receive-float interest rate swaps each with a notional amount of 200.0 million and a fixed interest rate of 3.89 per annum. These swaps commenced in June 2024 when the interest rate cap expired, and they will mature in December 2026, with a total notional amount of 800.0 million through December 2026. The contracts were executed in order to hedge the interest rate risk on a portion of the variable debt under the Credit Agreement and we receive variable amounts of interest from a counterparty at the greater of three-month SOFR or 0.50 per annum. As of September 28, 2024, the derivatives are considered highly effective.

Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024 due to a previously-disclosed material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We previously identified a material weakness that continues to exist, which relates to the lack of effectively designed and maintained IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; and (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored. 
 We are in the process of designing and implementing controls and taking other actions to remediate the material weakness described above, including implementing an enterprise resource planning software system. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until we complete the design and implementation of controls, the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 43 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, please refer to the section titled Risk Factors in the Prospectus. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in the Prospectus.

 Use of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering of Common Stock 
 On October 15, 2024 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-281971), which was declared effective on October 8, 2024. 
 Under the registration statement, we sold 27,600,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate at a price of 24.00 per share. This included 3,600,000 shares issued by the Company pursuant to the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC acted as representatives of the underwriters for the offering. We received net proceeds of approximately 616.2 million. There has been no material change in the use of proceeds as described in the Prospectus. 
 Ite m 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Ite m 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 None. 
 Ite m 5. Other Information.

(d) (A) A Default or Event of Default and (B) any Default or Event of Default resulting from the violation of a no Default or no Event of Default condition or any misrepresentation as to no Default or Event of Default as of any time solely as a result of the existence of such event, failure or transaction shall, in each case, cease to be continuing or existing and be deemed cured if the initial event, failure or transaction giving rise to such Default or Event of Default has either been publicly announced or notified to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing in any periodic or special report, including the Compliance Certificates, and two years shall have passed from the date of such announcement or notification without any acceleration or other enforcement action (including delivery of a notice of default) being taken by the Administrative Agent or the requisite Lenders hereunder with respect to such event, failure or transaction. 

(e) With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words exists, is continuing or similar expressions with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any Loan Party or other Restricted Subsidiary to take any action by a specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the applicable Loan Party or other Restricted Subsidiary takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any Loan Party or other Restricted Subsidiary that is not then permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, such 

Exhibit A 

Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a Cured Default ), any other Default or Event of Default resulting from the making or deemed making of any representation or warranty by any Loan Party or the taking of any action by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party, in each case which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneous with, the cure of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.02(e), an Event of Default (the Initial Default may not be cured pursuant to this Section 1.02(e): 

(i) if the taking of any action by any Loan Party or Subsidiary of a Loan Party that is not permitted during, and as a result of, the continuance of such Initial Default directly results in the cure of such Initial Default and the applicable Loan Party or Subsidiary had actual knowledge at the time of taking any such action that the Initial Default had occurred and was continuing, 

(ii) in the case of an Event of Default under Section 9.01(h) or (i) that directly results in material impairment of the rights and remedies of the Lenders, Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and that is incapable of being cured, 

(iii) in the case of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(c) arising due to the failure to perform or observe Section 6.07 that directly results in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties (taken as a whole) to perform their respective payment obligations under any Loan Document to which the Borrowers or any of the other Loan Parties is a party, or 

(iv) in the case of an Initial Default for which (i) the Borrower failed to promptly give notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of such Initial Default in accordance with Section 6.03(a) and (ii) the Borrower had actual knowledge of such failure to promptly give such notice. 

(f) The word incur shall be construed to mean incur, create, issue, assume, become liable in respect of or suffer to exist (and the words incurred and incurrence shall have correlative meanings). 

(g) The maturity , maturity date , scheduled maturity or final maturity (or words of similar import) of any Indebtedness or the date on which any Indebtedness matures shall mean the date specified in the definitive documentation in respect thereof as the fixed date on which the final payment of principal is due and payable and shall not mean the date on which the Indebtedness becomes due and payable as a result of the breach of any covenant or the occurrence of any cross-default. The maturity of any revolving facility shall be the termination date of the revolving commitments. The maturity of any delayed draw term facility shall be the maturity date of the term loan made thereunder but not the termination date of the term loan commitment. 

(h) With respect to multiple transactions consummated substantially concurrently with each other, the Borrower shall be permitted to designate the order such transactions are consummated; provided that, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to Section 1.08(e), Pro Forma Effect shall be given to all such transactions in determining the availability of any basket or the calculation of any financial ratio. 

(i) Section headings herein and in the other Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

Exhibit A 

(j) The Administrative Agent does not warrant nor accept any responsibility nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to (i) any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (ii) the administration, submission or any matter relating to the rates in the definition of Benchmark or with respect to any rate that is an alternative, comparable or successor rate thereto or (iii) the effect of any of the foregoing. 

Section 1.03 Accounting Terms; etc. . All accounting terms not specifically or completely defined herein shall be construed in conformity with, and all financial data (including financial ratios and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP, except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein. Unless the context indicates otherwise, any reference to a fiscal year shall refer to a fiscal year of the Borrower, and any reference to a fiscal quarter shall refer to a fiscal quarter of the Borrower. All determinations of fair market value (or similar term) or arm s-length (or similar term) under a Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower in good faith and if such determination is consistent with a valuation or opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, such determination shall be conclusive for all purposes under the Loan Documents. To the extent permitted by the Consolidating Financial Statements Exception and unless otherwise elected by the Borrower in its discretion, the consolidated results of the Reporting Entity shall be deemed to be the consolidated results of the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Borrower may, at its option, change the determination of its fiscal year, including to a 5-4-4 fiscal year, and with the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend this Agreement to effect any administrative and technical changes in connection therewith, and such amendment shall become effective without any further action by any Lender, and no Lender consent shall be required for the Administrative Agent to enter into such amendment. 

Section 1.04 Rounding . Any financial ratios required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one decimal place more than the number of decimal places by which such ratio is expressed herein (the applicable decimal place and rounding the result up or down to the applicable decimal place. 

Section 1.05 References to Agreements, Laws, Etc. 

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to Organization Documents, agreements (including the Loan Documents) and other contractual instruments shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only to the extent that such amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications are not prohibited by any Loan Document; and (b) references to any Law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending, replacing, supplementing or interpreting such Law as in effect from time to time.

Section 1.07 Available Amount Transactions . If more than one action occurs on any given date the permissibility of the taking of which is determined hereunder by reference to the amount of the Available Amount immediately prior to the taking of such action, the permissibility of the taking of each such action shall be determined independently, but in no event may any two or more such actions be treated as occurring simultaneously, i.e., each transaction must be permitted under the Available Amount as so calculated. 

Section 1.08 Pro Forma Calculations; Limited Condition Transactions; Basket and Ratio 

Exhibit A 

Compliance . 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, financial ratios and tests, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the TTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (and in each case, the component definitions thereof) shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this Section 1.08; provided , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clauses (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 1.08, when calculating the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of (1) the definition of Applicable Commitment Fee , (2) the definition of Applicable Rate , (3) [reserved], (4) the definition of Applicable ECF Prepayment Percentage and (5) the actual compliance with the Financial Covenant (but not any pro forma compliance thereof), the events described in this Section 1.08 that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period shall not be given Pro Forma Effect; provided , further that for purposes of determining the Applicable ECF Prepayment Percentage, (i) at the election of the Borrower but without duplication to the extent such reduction in Pari Passu Lien Debt has already been taken into account in calculating the Applicable ECF Prepayment Percentage for the immediate preceding fiscal year, effect shall be given to all voluntary prepayments of Term Loans, Incremental Equivalent Debt and other Pari Passu Lien Debt made on or prior to the date of the applicable mandatory prepayment and (ii) effect shall be given to the applicable mandatory prepayment, as contemplated in and in accordance with the definition of Applicable ECF Prepayment Percentage . 

(b) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio or test, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the TTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (and in each case, the component definitions thereof), Specified Transactions that have been made (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio, test or amount is made shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period and, with respect to any Permitted Investment, such Pro Forma Effect shall be given upon the execution of definitive documentation in respect thereof as if such transaction were immediately closed upon execution of such definitive documentation (unless and until terminated). If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.08, then the financial ratio or test, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the TTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA shall be calculated to give Pro Forma Effect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.08. With respect to any pro forma calculations to be made in connection with any acquisition or Investment in respect of which financial statements for the relevant target are not available for the same Test Period for which financial statements of the Borrower are available, the Borrower shall determine such pro forma calculations on the basis of the available financial statements (with appropriate adjustments if for differing periods) or such other basis as determined by the Borrower in a commercially reasonable manner. 

(c) Whenever Pro Forma Effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and, synergies projected by the Borrower in good faith to be realized as a result of specified actions taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had been realized on the first day of such Test Period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies were realized during the entirety of such period) relating to such Specified Transaction, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such 

Exhibit A 

actions (such cost savings and synergies, Specified Transaction Adjustments ); provided that (i) such Specified Transaction Adjustments are reasonably identifiable, reasonably anticipated to be realized and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Borrower, (ii) such actions are taken, committed to be taken or expected to be taken no later than 18 months after the date of such Specified Transactions, (iii) no amounts shall be added pursuant to this clause (c) to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in calculating Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to any Test Period and (iv) the aggregate amount of run rate cost savings, operating expense reductions and other cost synergies that may be added back pursuant to clause (a)(xix) of the definition of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in such Test Period, together with the Specified Transaction Adjustments with respect to such Test Period, shall not in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to 30 of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for such Test Period (calculated after giving effect to such addbacks and Specified Transaction Adjustments); provided , further , that, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Borrower, the Borrower may elect not to make all pro forma adjustments with respect to a Specified Transaction (other than a Restricted Payment) the amount or value of which, as applicable, is less than 25,000,000. 

(d) In the event that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment) any Indebtedness included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio, as the case may be, (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving Pro Forma Effect to such incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness, to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period with respect to leverage ratios or the first day of such Test Period with respect to coverage ratios. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given Pro Forma Effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of the event for which the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio or other coverage ratio is made had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any interest hedging arrangements applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, or other rate shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if not actually chosen, then based upon such optional rate as the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries may designate. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary (i) unless the Borrower elects otherwise, if the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of such related transactions (A) incurs Indebtedness, creates Liens, makes Dispositions, makes Investments, designates any Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted or repays any Indebtedness or takes any other action under or as permitted by a ratio-based basket and (B) incurs Indebtedness, creates Liens, makes Dispositions, makes Investments, designates any Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted or repays any Indebtedness or takes any other action under one or more non-ratio-based basket (which shall occur within 5 Business Days of the events in clause (A) above), then the applicable ratio will be calculated with respect to any such action under the applicable ratio-based basket under any negative covenant without regard to any such action under such non-ratio-based basket under such negative covenant made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions and (ii) if the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs Indebtedness under a ratio-based basket, (A) such ratio-based basket (together with any other ratio-based basket utilized in connection therewith, including in respect of other Indebtedness, Liens, Dispositions, Investments, Restricted Payments or payments in respect of Junior Financing) will be 

Exhibit A 

calculated excluding the cash proceeds of such Indebtedness for netting purposes (i.e., such cash proceeds shall not reduce the Borrower s Consolidated Net Debt pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of such term) and (B) the amount of any Revolving Loans or borrowings under any other revolving facility incurred currently therewith shall be excluded for purposes of determining any leverage ratio or coverage ratio, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Interest Coverage Ratio, as the case may be. For example, if the Borrower incurs Indebtedness under the General Debt Basket on the same date on which it incurs unsecured Incremental Equivalent Debt under the Ratio Incremental Amount, then the Total Net Leverage Ratio and any other applicable ratio will be calculated with respect to such incurrence under the Ratio Incremental Amount without regard to any incurrence of Indebtedness under the General Debt Basket. Without limiting the clause (f) below, (i) if the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries enter into any revolving facility commitments (including any Incremental Revolving Facility or revolving commitments in the form of Incremental Equivalent Debt), such revolving facility shall be deemed to be fully drawn as of the date such commitments are first received and thereafter the borrowings under such revolving facility shall not constitute incurrence of Indebtedness for purpose of Section 7.03 or for purpose of calculating the Incremental Amount and (ii) if the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries enter into any delayed draw term loan or other committed term debt facility, the Borrower may elect to determine compliance by such debt facility (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens from time to time in connection therewith) with this Agreement and each other Loan Document either (x) on the date such commitments with respect thereto first become effective assuming the full amount of such facility is incurred (and any applicable Liens are granted) on such date and thereafter the funding of such term debt facility shall not constitute incurrence or utilization of any basket capacity at such time for purposes of this Agreement or (y) on the date all or part of such term debt facility is funded, and in such case, the date on which the full amount of the commitments in respect of such facility are provided shall not constitute an incurrence or utilization of any basket capacity at such time for purposes of this Agreement (this clause (e), the Stacking Provision ). 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary, when (i) calculating any applicable ratio or basket (including any basket based on the TTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA) in connection with the incurrence of Indebtedness, the creation of Liens, the making of any Disposition, the making of an Investment, the making of a Restricted Payment, the designation of a Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted, the repayment of Indebtedness or for any other purpose, (ii) determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty, (iii) determining whether any Default or Event of Default has occurred, is continuing or would result from any action, or (iv) determining compliance with any other condition to any action or transaction, in each case of clauses (i) through (iv) in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of such ratio or basket, the accuracy of such representation or warranty (but taking into account any earlier date specified therein), whether any Default or Event of Default (or any Specified Event of Default) has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom, or the satisfaction of any other condition shall, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an LCT Election ), be deemed to be (i) the date the definitive agreements, or if customary for such transactions, letters of intent, for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into or, at the option of the Borrower, amended, or (ii) the date an irrevocable notice for prepayment or redemption is delivered, as applicable provided that, notwithstanding the LCT Election made under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Borrower may elect (in its sole discretion) to re-determine one or more of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above at the time of (w) any amendment to any definitive agreements or letters of intent referred to in clause (i), (x) any delivery of financial statements prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or other transaction in connection therewith or action or transaction related thereto, (y) the consummation of any other transaction for which pro forma calculations are required under the Loan Documents prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or other transaction in connection therewith or action or transaction related thereto, or (z) the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or other transaction in connection therewith or action or transaction related thereto) 

Exhibit A 

(the LCT Test Date ). If on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) such ratios, amounts, representations and warranties, absence of defaults, satisfaction of conditions and other provisions are calculated as if such Limited Condition Transaction or other transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with the applicable ratios, amounts or other provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if any of such ratios, amounts, representations and warranties, absence of defaults, satisfaction of conditions or other provisions are exceeded or breached as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA), a change in facts and circumstances or other provisions at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transaction, such ratios, representations and warranties, absence of defaults, satisfaction of conditions precedent and other provisions will not be deemed to have been exceeded, breached, or otherwise failed as a result of such fluctuations or changed circumstances solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction and any related transactions is permitted hereunder provided that, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or increased baskets may be utilized) and (ii) such ratios and compliance with such conditions shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or related Specified Transactions; provided , that the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine availability under any baskets, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such basket. If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to any other Specified Transaction or otherwise on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated, the date that the definitive agreement, or if customary for such transactions, letters of intent, for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires or the date on which the irrevocable notice has expired, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. For purposes of any calculation pursuant to this clause (f) of the Interest Coverage Ratio or other coverage ratios, Consolidated Interest Expense may be calculated using an assumed interest rate for the Indebtedness to be incurred in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction based on the indicative interest margin contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Borrower in good faith. 

(g) [Reserved]. 

(h) If any incurrence of Indebtedness, creation of Liens, making of Dispositions, making of Investments, designation of any Subsidiary as restricted or unrestricted or repayment of any Indebtedness or taking of any other action under any provision in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or any portion of the foregoing) previously divided and classified (or re-divided and re-classified) under any non-ratio based basket, could subsequently be re-divided and re-classified under any ratio-based basket, such re-division and reclassification shall be deemed to occur automatically, in each case, unless otherwise elected by the Borrower. In addition, with respect to multiple transactions, the Borrower shall be permitted to sequence (and subsequently re-sequence) the order such transactions are deemed to be consummated for purposes of incurring each such transaction under an applicable basket on a pro forma basis ; provided that, subject to the Stacking Provision, Pro Forma Effect shall be given to all such transactions in determining the availability of any non-ratio-based basket or ratio-based basket. 

Section 1.09 Currency Equivalents Generally . 

Exhibit A 

(a) In determining whether any Indebtedness, Investment, Lien, Disposition, Restricted Payment or any other amount under a fixed amount basket denominated in Dollars may be incurred in a currency other than Dollars or whether any threshold amount or eligibility requirement denominated in Dollars applies, such amount shall be determined by the Borrower in good faith based on the currency exchange rate determined at the time of such incurrence or becoming into existence (or, in the case of any revolving Indebtedness or any amount committed to be made, at the time it is first committed), or reasonably in advance of the incurrence thereof; provided that if any Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. No Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness, Investment, Lien, Disposition, Restricted Payment or such other amount is incurred, made or determined. 

(b) For purposes of determining the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, the Consolidated Total Assets, the Consolidated Interest Expense, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and any other financial ratios, all amounts denominated in a currency other than Dollars will be converted to Dollars for any purpose (including testing the Financial Covenant or any other financial covenant) at the effective rate of exchange in respect thereof reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Borrower for the applicable Test Period for which such measurement is being made (or, at the option of the Borrower, the average exchange rate with respect to the applicable currency over the applicable Test Period), and will reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of Hedge Agreements permitted hereunder for currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination of the Dollar equivalent of such Indebtedness. 

Section 1.10 Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary . 

Any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred hereunder (including any Incremental Facilities) may be incurred, at the option of the Borrower, by a newly created and newly designated Unrestricted Subsidiary (an Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary with no assets other than the cash proceeds of such incurred Indebtedness plus , subject to compliance with Section 7.02, any cash and Cash Equivalents contributed to such Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary as deposit of interest expenses and fees, additional cash collateral or for other purposes, which Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary will then merge with and into the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary surviving the merger and assuming all obligations of the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary. So long as such Indebtedness would have been permitted to be incurred directly by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary upon the incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary, or, with respect to any Indebtedness incurred in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, at the option of the Borrower, at the time the LCT Election is made, the creation, designation and re-designation of the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary and the merger of the Unrestricted Escrow Subsidiary into the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be subject to any additional condition, including any condition that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time. 
 Section 1.11 Cashless Transactions . 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, to the extent that (x) any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces, renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Loans with Incremental Facilities, Refinancing Loans, Extended Loans or loans incurred under a new credit facility or (y) any of Indebtedness of the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary 
 Exhibit A 

is refinanced, renewed or replaced with Incremental Facilities or loans incurred under a new credit facility, in each case above, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means of a cashless roll by such Lender of any Loans or such creditor of other Indebtedness, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with (x) any requirement hereunder or any other Loan Document that any payment be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, in cash or any other similar requirement or (y) any cash funding requirement under Section 2.01, Section 2.02 or Section 2.14, as applicable. 
 Section 1.12 Payment and Performance . 

If any payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation is stated to be due or performance required hereunder on a day other than a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as described in the definition of Interest Period or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day (it being understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of calculating financial covenants and computations contained herein and determining compliance therewith, if payment is made, in full, on any such extended due date, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid on the original due date without giving effect to any extension thereto). 
 Section 1.13 Benchmark Replacement Setting . 

(a) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders (or, to the extent affecting only certain Facilities, Lenders comprising Required Facility Lenders of the affected Facility or Facilities (in the case of multiple Facilities affected, voting as one Class)). No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13(a) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 

(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 1.13(d) and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 1.13 including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole 

Exhibit A 

discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 1.13. 

(d) Unavailability or Addition of Tenor of Benchmark .

Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan by the Swing Line Lender, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of such Swing Line Loan; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date with respect to the Revolving Non-Extended Tranche Commitments, any participation in a Swing Line Loan by a Revolving Non-Extended Tranche Lender will be automatically reallocated to the Revolving Extended Tranche Lenders based on each such Revolving Extended Tranche Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 

(b) Borrowing Mechanics for Swing Line Loans . Each Swing Line Loan Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent. Each such notice shall be in the form of a written Swing Line Loan Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, and must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of the requested Swing Line Loan Borrowing (or such later time as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion), and such notice shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be in a minimum of 100,000 or a whole multiple of 25,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the date of such Swing Line Loan Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day).

Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of the Required Revolving Lenders) prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such requested borrowing date (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.03(a) or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender shall make each Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower, by wire transfer thereof in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Swing Line Lender, on the requested date of such Swing Line Loan (which instructions may include standing payment instructions, which may be updated from time to time by the Borrower, provided that, unless the Swing Line Lender 

Exhibit A 

shall otherwise agree, any such update shall not take effect until the Business Day immediately following the date on which such update is provided to the Swing Line Lender). 

(c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans . 

(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans made by the Swing Line Lender then outstanding (the Refunded Swing Line Loans ). Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Swing Line Loan Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance (including with respect to prior notice requirements) with the requirements of Section 2.02(b), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein, but subject to the aggregate unused Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of such Swing Line Loan Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Swing Line Loan Request available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day specified in such Swing Line Loan Request, whereupon, subject to Section 2.03(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. 

(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Loan Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.03(c)(i), the request for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swing Line Loan funded pursuant to this clause (ii), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swing Line Loan (to the extent of such funded participations) shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders and not to the Swing Line Lender. 

(iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Loan Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the 

Exhibit A 

Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(iv) Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02; provided , further , that for the avoidance of doubt, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall not apply to the purchase or funding of participations pursuant to this Section 2.03(c). No such funding of participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 

(d) Repayment of Participations . 

(i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will promptly remit such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of such payment to the Administrative Agent (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lender s participation was funded) in like funds as received by the Swing Line Lender, and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent will be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have funded their participations pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) to the extent of their interests therein. 

(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its reasonable discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 

(e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender . The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans made by the Swing Line Lender. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan or participation pursuant to this Section 2.03 to refinance such Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan made by the Swing Line Lender, interest in respect of such Lender s share thereof shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 

(f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender . Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender. 

Exhibit A 

(g) Resignation and Removal of the Swing Line Lender .

The Swing Line Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender being replaced provided that no consent will be required if the replaced Swing Line Lender has no Swing Line Loans outstanding) and the successor Swing Line Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Swing Line Lender. At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, (i) the Borrower shall prepay any outstanding Swing Line Loans made by the resigning or removed Swing Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the resigning or removed Swing Line Lender shall surrender any Swing Line Note held by it to the Borrower for cancellation, and (iii) the Borrower shall issue, if so requested by the successor Swing Line Lender, a new Swing Line Note to the successor Swing Line Lender, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Sublimit then in effect and with other appropriate insertions. From and after the effective date of any such replacement or resignation, (x) any successor Swing Line Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of a Swing Line Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swing Line Loans made thereafter and (y) references herein to the term Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Swing Line Lender, or to such successor and all previous Swing Line Lenders, as the context shall require.

(ii) Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the copy of a Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i), the Administrative Agent shall confirm to the relevant Issuing Bank if the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof and then, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, such Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of such Letter of Credit; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date with respect to the Revolving Non-Extended Tranche Commitments, any participation in a Letter of Credit by a Revolving Non-Extended Tranche Lender will be automatically reallocated to the Revolving Extended Tranche Lenders based on each such Revolving Extended Tranche Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of such Letter of Credit. 

(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application for a standby Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its reasonable discretion, agree to issue a standby Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit ); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit shall permit such Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Nonextension Notice Date in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the 

Exhibit A 

applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Facility Expiration Date; provided , however , that no Issuing Bank shall (A) permit any such extension if (1) such Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.04(a) or otherwise) or (2) it has received written notice on or before the day that is 10 Business Days before the Nonextension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (B) be obligated to permit such extension if it has received written notice on or before the day that is 10 Business Days before the Nonextension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the applicable Issuing Bank not to permit such extension. 

(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 

(c) Drawings and Reimbursement; Funding of Participations . 

(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of a compliant drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and such Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. (x) If an Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower of any payment by such Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of such payment, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing not later than the next Business Day after receipt of such notice and (y) if such notice is not provided to the Borrower prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such payment date, then the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing not later than the end of the second Business Day after receipt of such notice, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing fees in respect of such Letter of Credit. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing Bank by such time, such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such failure and the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify each Revolving Lender of such payment date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in the Dollar Amount thereof in the case of an Alternative Currency) (the Reimbursement Obligations and the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof based on the participations of such Lender in the Letter of Credit under which such drawing was made. In such event, (x) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations denominated in Dollars and Euros, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested (1) in the case of Dollars, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or (2) in the case of Euros, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans, denominated in Euros, with an Interest Period of 1 month, (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations denominated in British Pounds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan Borrowing of RFR Loans and (z) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds or Euros) (but expressed in its Dollar Amount), the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars with an Interest Period of 1 month, in each case, to be disbursed on such payment date in an amount equal to (A) the Dollar Amount of such Reimbursement Obligation plus (B) in the case of any Reimbursement Obligation denominated in any Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds or Euros) (but expressed in its Dollar Amount), an additional amount equal to the amount required to convert 

Exhibit A 

Dollars into the currency of the unreimbursed drawing, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02(b) for the principal amount of the applicable Type of Loans, but subject to the aggregate unused Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this clause (i) shall be given in writing. 

(ii) Each Revolving Lender (including each Revolving Lender acting as an Issuing Bank) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.04(c)(iii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan (A) in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or Euros, that is (1) in the case of Dollars, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or (2) in the case of Euros, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans, denominated in Euros, with an Interest Period of 1 month, (B) in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in British Pounds, that is an RFR Loan and (C) in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds or Euros), that is a Term Benchmark Loan in Dollars with an Interest Period of 1 month, in each case, to the Borrower in such amount plus , in the case of any Reimbursement Obligation denominated in any Alternative Currency (but expressed in its Dollar Amount), an additional amount equal to the amount required to convert Dollars into the currency of the unreimbursed drawing. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Issuing Bank in accordance with the instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by such Issuing Bank (which instructions may include standing payment instructions, which may be updated from time to time by such Issuing Bank, provided that, unless the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree, any such update shall not take effect until the Business Day immediately following the date on which such update is provided to the Administrative Agent). 

(iii) With respect to any Reimbursement Obligation that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Loan Borrowing of (A) for Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or Euros, (1) in the case of Dollars, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or (2) in the case of Euros, a Revolving Loan Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans, denominated in Euros, with an Interest Period of 1 month, (B) RFR Loans for Letters of Credit denominated in British Pounds, or (C) Term Benchmark Loans for Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds or Euros), as the case may be, because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit Borrowing in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation that is not so refinanced plus , in the case of any Reimbursement Obligation denominated in an Alternative Currency (but expressed in its Dollar Amount), an additional amount equal to the amount required to convert Dollars into the currency of the unreimbursed drawing. In such event, each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section. 

(iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit Advance to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Issuing Bank. 

Exhibit A 

(v) Each Revolving Lender s obligations to make Revolving Loans or Letter of Credit Advances to reimburse an Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.04(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such Issuing Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this paragraph (c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of a participation in any Letter of Credit shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 

(vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by such Issuing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or Letter of Credit Advance in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d) Repayment of Participations . 

(i) If, at any time after the applicable Issuing Bank has made payment in respect of any drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it and has received from any Revolving Lender its Letter of Credit Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.04(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Reimbursement Obligation or, in the case of any Reimbursement Obligation denominated in an Alternative Currency (but expressed in its Dollar Amount), an additional amount equal to the amount required to convert Dollars into the currency of the unreimbursed drawing, or, in each case, interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s Letter of Credit Advance was outstanding) in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. 

(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by 

Exhibit A 

such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 

(e) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Banks for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit or any term or provision thereof, any Loan Document, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; 

(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Banks or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 

(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 

(iv) any payment by an Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by an Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 

(v) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit; or 

(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower; 

provided , that the foregoing shall not excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted under applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
 (f) Role of Issuing Banks . Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Banks shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any document or the authority of the Person executing 

Exhibit A 

or delivering any document. None of any Issuing Bank, any of its Agent-Related Persons nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the requisite Revolving Lenders; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts of omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Banks, any of its Agent-Related Persons, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Banks shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.04(e). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the applicable Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Banks shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The Issuing Banks may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communication with a beneficiary. 

(g) Applicability of ISP . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a standby Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the International Standby Practices 1998 published by the Institute of International Banking Law Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall be stated therein to apply to such standby Letter of Credit. 

(h) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application . In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control. 

(i) Reporting . Each month (or at such other intervals as the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank shall agree), the applicable Issuing Bank shall provide to the Administrative Agent a schedule of the Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, showing the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit and the current amount outstanding, the expiration date, and the reference number of any Letter of Credit outstanding at any time during such month, and showing the aggregate amount (if any) payable by the Borrower to such Issuing Bank during such month. 

(j) Existing Letters of Credit . For the avoidance of doubt, all letters of credit issued for the account of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, issued under the Existing First Lien Credit Agreement and outstanding on the Closing Date and issued by an entity that is the Issuing Bank (or its designee) under this Agreement, which, by its execution of this Agreement, has agreed to continue to act as an Issuing Bank hereunder and listed on Schedule 2.04 (each, an Existing Letter of Credit shall automatically be continued hereunder on the Closing Date by the applicable Issuing Bank, and as of the Closing Date the Revolving Lenders shall acquire or continue to hold, as applicable, a participation therein, and each such Existing Letter of Credit shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be a Letter of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement as of the Closing Date without any further action by the Borrower. 

(k) Resignation and Removal of an Issuing Bank . Any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank upon 60 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders and the Borrower. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank being replaced provided that no consent will be required if the 

Exhibit A 

Issuing Bank being replaced has no Letters of Credit or Reimbursement Obligations with respect thereto outstanding) and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank. From and after the effective date of any such replacement or resignation, (i) any successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement or resignation of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced or resigning Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto to the extent that Letters of Credit issued by it remain outstanding and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement or resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 

(l) Cash Collateral Account . At any time and from time to time, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, at the direction or with the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders, may require the Borrower to deliver to the Administrative Agent such amount of cash as is equal to 101 of the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit at any time outstanding (whether or not any beneficiary under any Letter of Credit shall have drawn or be entitled at such time to draw thereunder) to be held by the Administrative Agent in a Cash Collateral Account. The Borrower hereby grants (or, if registration thereof is required in any applicable jurisdiction, shall grant) to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders, a Lien upon and security interest in the Cash Collateral Account and all amounts held therein from time to time as security for Letter of Credit Usage, and for application to the Borrower s Letter of Credit Obligations as and when the same shall arise. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest on the investment of such amounts in Cash Equivalents, which investments shall be made at the direction of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the determination as to investments shall be made at the option and in the discretion of the Administrative Agent), amounts in the Cash Collateral Account shall not bear interest. Interest and profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. In the event of a drawing, and subsequent payment by the applicable Issuing Bank, under any Letter of Credit at any time during which any amounts are held in the Cash Collateral Account, the Administrative Agent will deliver to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to the Reimbursement Obligation created as a result of such payment (or, if the amounts so held are less than such Reimbursement Obligation, all of such amounts) to reimburse such Issuing Bank therefor. Any amounts remaining in the Cash Collateral Account after the expiration of all Letters of Credit with no pending drawings and reimbursement in full of each Issuing Bank for all of its obligations thereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Borrower, to be applied against the Obligations in such order and manner as the Administrative Agent may direct. If the Borrower is required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.04(l), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower on demand, provided that after giving effect to such return (A) the Total Utilization of Revolving Commitments at such time would not exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments at such time and (B) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time. 

(m) Addition of an Issuing Bank . One or more Revolving Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender) selected by the Borrower that agrees to act in such capacity and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent may become an additional Issuing Bank hereunder pursuant to a written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Revolving Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such additional Issuing Bank. 

Exhibit A 

Section 2.05 Conversion/Continuation . 

(a) Each conversion of Loans from one Type to another, each continuation of a Type of Loans and each election of a new Interest Payment Date for an RFR Borrowing, shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may only be given in writing, provided that Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency may not be converted into a Type of Loan that is not available hereunder with respect to such Alternative Currency. Each such notice must be in writing and must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) (i) 3 Business Days prior to the requested date of any conversion of Base Rate Loans to, or continuation of, Term Benchmark Loans, (ii) 3 Business Days prior to the requested date of any election of a new Interest Payment Date for an RFR Borrowing, (iii) 3 Business Days prior to the requested date of any continuation of any Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds and Euros) and (iv) 3 Business Days prior to the requested date of any conversion of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans to Base Rate Loans. Each notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) must be delivered to the Administrative Agent in the form of a Conversion/Continuation Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans shall be in a principal amount not less than (x) 500,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof (or the entire principal amount of such Loan) if denominated in Dollars, or (y) 500,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof (or the entire principal amount of such Loan) if denominated in Euros. Each conversion to RFR Loans shall be in a principal amount not less than 500,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof (or the entire principal amount of such Loan). Each conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of 500,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof (or the entire principal amount of such Loan). Each conversion or continuation of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds and Euros) shall be in a minimum amount to be agreed with the Appropriate Lenders of the applicable Class upon such currency becoming an Alternative Currency. Each Conversion/Continuation Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of a Type of Loans, (ii) the requested date of the conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be converted or continued, (iv) the Class of Loans to be converted or continued, (v) the Type of Loans to which such existing Loans are to be converted, if applicable, and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If (x) with respect to any Term Benchmark Loans, the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be converted to a Term Benchmark Loan with an Interest Period of 1 month or (y) with respect to any Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds or Euros), the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Loans shall be converted to a Loan of the Type and with the Interest Period, if applicable, to be agreed with the Lenders of the applicable Class for Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency upon such currency becoming an Alternative Currency. Any such automatic conversion or continuation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term Benchmark Loans or Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds). If the Borrower requests a conversion to, or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans or Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds) in any such Conversion/Continuation Notice but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of 1 month. If no Interest Payment Date is specified with respect to any RFR Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Payment Date of 1 month s duration. 

(b) Following receipt of a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Loans described in Section 2.05(a). 

Exhibit A 

(c) This Section shall not apply to Swing Line Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 

Section 2.06 Availability . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (a) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the applicable Loans comprising such Borrowing and (b) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.06 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s applicable Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 

Section 2.07 Prepayments . 

(a) Optional . 

(i) The Borrower may, upon notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in the form of a Prepayment Notice, at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay the Loans of any Class in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to clause (E) below; provided that:

Exhibit A 

(C) any prepayment of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds and Euros) shall be in a minimum amount to be agreed with the Appropriate Lenders of the applicable Class upon such currency becoming an Alternative Currency or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding;

Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the entries in the Register, the entries in the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. 

Exhibit A 

(b) Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence the relevant Class of such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.

If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its proportionate share (based on such Appropriate Lender s participation in the amount so paid) (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office; provided that the proceeds of any borrowing of Revolving Loans to finance the reimbursement of a drawn Letter of Credit as provided in Section 2.04(c) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree to separate cut-off times for payments made in connection with the payoff of one or more Facilities set forth in customary payoff letters without the consent of any Lender. 

(b) [Reserved]. 

(c) Unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank, as applicable, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to such Lender or such Issuing Bank. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender or such Issuing Bank in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. 

(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the applicable conditions to the Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 

(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.07 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other 

Exhibit A 

Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 

(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 

(g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 9.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. 

(h) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to 2.04(c), 2.06, 2.15 or 10.07, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender s obligations to the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Banks until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 

Section 2.15 Sharing of Payments, Etc. 

If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on account of the Loans of a particular Class made by it (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans of such Class made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in Letter of Credit Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each relevant Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including Section 2.07(a)(iv) and Section 11.07), (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder or (C) any payment received by such Lender not in its capacity as a Lender. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing 
 Exhibit A 

a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 11.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.15 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

(iii) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders with Revolving Commitments in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent that (A) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (B) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment.

So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (A) no Swing Line Lender shall be required to issue, extend or amend any Swing Line Loan unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto and (B) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend or amend any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Revolving Lenders, (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that the Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Revolving Lenders as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 

(ii) Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.20 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 

(iii) Termination of Requirement . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Bank s or the Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20 following (A) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender) or (B) the determination by the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.20, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable Issuing Bank may agree that the Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations; provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents. 

Section 2.21 Currency Equivalents . 

(a) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Amount of each Revolving Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency and Letter of Credit Obligation in respect of Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency on each Revaluation Date.

(b) If after giving effect to any such determination of the Dollar Amount, the Total Utilization of Revolving Commitments exceeds the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall, within 5 Business Days of receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent setting forth such calculation in reasonable detail, prepay the applicable Revolving Loans under the Revolving Facility or take other action as the Administrative Agent, in its discretion, may direct (including to Cash 

Exhibit A 

Collateralize the applicable Letter of Credit Obligations) to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess. 

Section 2.22 Judgment Currency . 

(a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction, the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

Payments under this Section 3.01(g) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Borrower receives written demand for payment from such Recipient. 

(h) If any Recipient determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or any Guarantor, as the case may be, or with respect to which the Borrower or any Guarantor, as the case may be, has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by or on behalf of the Borrower or Holdings, as the case may be under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower or Holdings, as the case may be, upon the request of such Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or Holdings, as the case may be plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Recipient in the event such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (i), in no event will such Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower or Holdings pursuant to this paragraph (i) the payment of which would place such Recipient in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax or Other Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax or Other Tax had never been paid. Such Recipient, as the case may be, shall provide the Borrower upon request with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence reasonably available of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority provided that such Recipient may delete any information therein that such Recipient deems confidential or not relevant to such refund in its reasonable discretion). This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person. 

(i) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a) or (g) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any such event by designating another Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event or assigning its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation would reduce or eliminate any amount of Taxes or Other Taxes required to be deducted or withheld or paid by the Borrower; provided that such designation is made at the Borrower s expense and are on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, do not cause such Lender or any of its Lending Offices to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.01(i) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or (g). 

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may deduct and withhold any taxes required by any Laws (including, for the avoidance of doubt, FATCA) to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.01. 

(k) Each Agent or Lender, as applicable, shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Agent or Lender (but only to 

Exhibit A 

the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.07(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Agent or Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Agent or Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Agent and Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Agent or Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Agent or Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 3.01(k). 

(l) Without limiting the foregoing, any Administrative Agent that is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code will deliver to the Borrower, on or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower), duly completed copies of a U.S. branch withholding certificate on IRS Form W-8IMY evidencing its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a U.S. person, with the effect that the Borrower will be entitled to make payments hereunder to the Administrative Agent without withholding or deduction on account of U.S. federal withholding tax. 

(m) The agreements in this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, termination of this Agreement and the payment, satisfaction or discharge of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and any assignment of rights by, or replacement of, any Lender. 

Section 3.02 Illegality . If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or Daily Simple RFR or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or Daily Simple RFR, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Loans, to make RFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate , the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate , in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans, or a Borrowing of or conversion to RFR Loans, as applicable, and shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate ), either on the Interest Payment Date therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, or (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by each 

Exhibit A 

affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 

Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates . Subject to Section 1.13, (a) (i) if on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Loans the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or (ii) on any day, the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Daily Simple RFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof or, (b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Term Benchmark Loan, or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Loan or a request for an RFR Loan or a conversion thereto, as applicable, does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term Benchmark Loans, affected RFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Loan of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans, or for a Loan of or conversion to RFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, or Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period, and any outstanding affected RFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans on and from the date of such notice. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted. Subject to Section 2.20, if the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 

Section 3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy . 

(a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender; 

(ii) subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, in respect thereof (except for (A) Taxes indemnifiable pursuant to Section 3.01, (B) any taxes and other amounts described in clauses (ii) through (v) of the second sentence of Section 3.01(a), (C) Connection Income Taxes, and (D) Other Taxes); or 

(iii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any participation in a Letter of Credit that is not otherwise accounted for in the definition of Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or Daily Simple RFR or this clause (a); 

Exhibit A 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or the Daily Simple RFR, in the case of a Change in Law with respect to Taxes, making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank (whether of principal, interest or any other amount)) then, from time to time within 10 days after demand by such Lender or such Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) provided that such calculation will not in an way require disclosure of confidential or price-sensitive information or any other information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law), the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. No Lender or Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender shall request that the Borrower pay any additional amount pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) unless it shall concurrently make similar requests to other borrowers similarly situated and affected by such Change in Law and from whom such Lender or Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender is entitled to seek similar amounts. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Issuing Bank or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or such Issuing Bank or the Loans made by or Letters of Credit issued by it to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to liquidity or capital adequacy), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or such Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent) provided that such calculation will not in an way require disclosure of confidential or price-sensitive information or any other information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law), the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or their respective holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 or Section 3.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 or Section 3.01 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law or other matter giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law or other matter giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

Exhibit A 

Section 3.05 Funding Losses . 

Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount (provided that such calculation will not in an way require disclosure of confidential or price-sensitive information or any other information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law), the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost, liability or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by it as a result of: 
 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any EURIBO Rate Loan or any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 

(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any EURIBO Rate Loan or any Term Benchmark Revolving Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 

(c) any assignment of a EURIBO Rate Loan or a Term Benchmark Revolving Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07; 

including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender may make any demand under this Section 3.05 (i) in connection with any prepayment of interest on Term Loans or (ii) in connection with any prepayment of the Loans for which the Borrower has delivered notice to the Lenders 3 Business Days prior to such date of prepayment, and the Lenders do not submit a demand for reimbursement in accordance with this Section 3.05 within 1 Business Day of such prepayment. 
 Section 3.06 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation . 

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material economic, legal or regulatory respect. 

(b) Suspension of Lender Obligations . If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, to make RFR Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term Benchmark Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.06(c) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. 

(c) Conversion of Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans . If any Lender gives notice to the 

Exhibit A 

Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender s Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Term Benchmark Loans or after the next Interest Payment Date for RFR Loans, as applicable, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans of a given Class held by the Lenders of such Class holding Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, Interest Periods and Interest Payment Dates) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 

Section 3.07 Replacement of Lenders Under Certain Circumstances . If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or ceases to make Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, as a result of any condition described in Section 3.02 or Section 3.04, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 3.01(i), (iii) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, (iv) any Lender does not accept an Extension Offer, a Permitted Debt Exchange Offer or declines to execute a Refinancing Amendment requesting all Lenders of the applicable Class to provide the relevant Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness, (v) any Lender shall become and continue to be a Defaulting Lender or (vi) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the Commitments of such Lender and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender in relation to Loans and participations held by such Lender (or, at the option of the Borrower, terminate the Commitments and repay the Loans in respect of any Class thereof directly related to any of the circumstances described in clauses (i) (vi) above) and/or (y) require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.04) to one or more Eligible Assignees that shall assume such obligations (any of which assignee may be another Lender, if such Lender accepts such assignment) (or, at the option of the Borrower, cause such Lender to assign Commitments and/or Loans in respect of any Class thereof directly related to any of the circumstances described in clauses (i) (vi) above), provided that, in the case of clause (y) above: 

(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 11.07(b)(iv); 

(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts payable under Section 2.11(g) and Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), or, as applicable, of the applicable Class of Commitments and/or Loans subject to the assignment; 

(c) such Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender s Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans (or, as applicable, of the applicable Class of Commitments and/or Loans subject to such assignment), and (ii) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or Administrative Agent (or a lost or destroyed note indemnity in lieu thereof); provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be 

Exhibit A 

recorded in the Register and the Notes shall be deemed to be canceled upon such failure; 

(d) the Eligible Assignee shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender; 

(e) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 

(f) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender being a Non-Consenting Lender, the Eligible Assignee shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Lender being replaced was a Non-Consenting Lender. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, any Lender that acts as an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of cash collateral in the Minimum Collateral Amount (calculated for this purpose, solely with respect to such Issuing Bank) into a cash collateral account pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank) have been made with respect to each such outstanding Letter of Credit and the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 10.09. 
 In the event that (i) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that Lenders consent to a departure from or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, each directly and adversely affected lender, each affected Lender, or each Lender of a certain Class and (iii) the majority of such group of Lenders with the voting right (including the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Lenders or Required Facility Lenders, as applicable) as determined by the Borrower, have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender within such sub-group of Lenders who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender . 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 Section 3.08 Survival . All of the Borrower s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.

Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any agency or fiduciary or trust relationship with any Lender, Holdings, the Borrower, or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Each 
 Exhibit A 

Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. Any Agent may resign from such role at any time, with immediate effect, by giving prior written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and Borrower. 
 Section 10.09 Resignation of Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent . The Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), at all times other than during the existence of a Specified Event of Default, to appoint a successor, which shall be a Lender or a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such Lender or bank with an office in the United States and who is a U.S. person and a financial institution within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(ii). If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, meeting the qualifications set forth above (including the consent of the Borrower); provided that if the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor of such Agent is appointed) and (b) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or retired Administrative Agents, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. If neither the Required Lenders nor the Administrative Agent have appointed a successor Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall be deemed to have succeeded to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (subject to the proviso in the sentence above). Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to perfect or continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or retired Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 10.07, 11.04 and 11.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Agent-Related Persons in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable. 

Section 10.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim; Credit Bidding . In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative 

Exhibit A 

to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 

(a) to file a verified statement pursuant to rule 2019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure that, in its sole opinion, complies with such rule s disclosure requirements for entities representing more than one creditor; 

(b) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, Letter of Credit Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 

(c) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 11.04. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 11.04 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Lenders or the Issuing Banks may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. 
 Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding. 
 The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (i) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, or any similar Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject and (ii) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any 
 Exhibit A 

applicable Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any such bid (A) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (B) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (i) of Section 11.01 of this Agreement), (C) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of the Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action and (D) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. 
 Section 10.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters . 

(a) Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank and a potential Hedge Bank or an Affiliate thereof) and each Issuing Bank irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to be the agent for and representative of the Lenders and Issuing Bank with respect to the Guaranty, the Collateral and the Collateral Documents. 

(b) Each Agent, each Lender and each other Secured Party agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document: 

(i) Liens on any property granted to or held by an Agent or in favor of any Secured Party under any Loan Document will be automatically released or subordinated, as applicable, without further action from any Person (and as applicable, this provision constitutes the express authorization from the Secured Parties of the disposition of such property free of such Lien under Section 9-315 of the UCC (or similar provisions under applicable Laws)), 

(A) upon satisfaction of the Termination Conditions; 

(B) at the time the property subject to such Lien is transferred (or to be transferred) as part of, or in connection with, any transfer permitted under the Loan Documents to any Person that is not a Loan Party, 

(C) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (ii) below; 

(D) subject to Section 11.01 in respect of releases of all or substantially all of 

Exhibit A 

the Collateral, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders; 

(E) upon such property becoming an Excluded Asset or Excluded Equity Interest; 

(F) upon any property becoming subject to a Securitization Financing or Receivables Financing Transaction to the extent required by the terms of such Securitization Financing or Receivables Financing Transaction; and/or 

(G) upon delivery of written notice by the Borrower, if the property is subject to a Lien that is permitted under (i) Section 7.01(c), (e), (l), (m)(i), (n), (q) or (o) or (ii) Section 7.01(u), (v) or (x), to the extent such Lien is of the type referred to or constitutes a modification, renewal or extension of any Lien described in clause (i). 

(ii) Any Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically released without further action from any Person if such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary (in each case, as certified in writing by a Responsible Officer), except that such automatic release shall only occur upon delivery of written notice of release from the Borrower with respect to any Excluded Subsidiary that is added as a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the proviso to the definition of Excluded Subsidiary (including any Immaterial Subsidiary or non-wholly owned Subsidiary that is added as a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to such proviso ); provided that no Subsidiary Guarantor will be released solely as a result of such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a wholly owned Subsidiary unless one of the following conditions is satisfied: (I) (a) such transaction is entered into for a bona fide business purpose (as determined in good faith by the Borrower) and, for the avoidance of doubt, not the primary purpose of causing such release and (b) the portion of Equity Interests that caused such Guarantor to cease to be wholly owned were not transferred to an Affiliate of the Borrower (other than for purposes of a bona fide joint venture arrangement on terms that are not less favorable than arms-length terms), (II) such Person ceases to constitute a Subsidiary under the Loan Documents or (III) such Person otherwise constitutes an Excluded Subsidiary (other than solely on account of constituting a non-wholly owned Subsidiary), and 

(iii) upon request of the Borrower in connection with any Liens permitted by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required to subordinate the Lien on any Collateral to any Lien permitted under Section 7.01 to be senior to the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent. 

Each Agent, each Lender and each other Secured Party agrees that upon written request from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly take such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower, including filing UCC termination statements, filing Intellectual Property releases, returning possession of possessory Collateral, and executing and filing other instruments, releases and documents evidencing the release of such Liens or Guarantors, as applicable, at the Borrower s sole cost and expense, in connection with any of the foregoing releases (or, if requested by the Borrower, to confirm the subordination in writing its Lien pursuant to clause (b)(i)(G) above). Each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to and shall rely exclusively on an officer s certificate of the Borrower that one or more conditions set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) above are satisfied, without any independent verification. Each Lender and each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes and irrevocably directs the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent to take such actions and execute any such documents and consents to such reliance. Notwithstanding anything 
 Exhibit A 

set forth above, it is understood and agreed that such written release is customarily requested for the convenience of facilitating any transfer of property to a third-party purchaser or for similar reasons but such written release shall not be required for any such release to become effective (which release is governed by clauses (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above) and any prior requests from the Borrower for such written release shall not impose on the Borrower an obligation to seek such releases in future transactions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent s Lien thereon, or contained in any certificate prepared or delivered by the Borrower or any Loan Party in connection with the Collateral or compliance with the terms set forth above or in a Loan Document, nor shall the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.

For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph may be enforced against any Lender by the Required Lenders, the Agents or the Borrower and each Lender and the Agents expressly acknowledge that this paragraph shall be available as a defense of the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any action or proceeding.

Exhibit A 

any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually, as a Supplemental Administrative Agent and, collectively, as Supplemental Administrative Agents ).

(c) Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower or Holdings, as applicable, shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Administrative Agent. 

Section 10.14 Intercreditor Agreements .

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Cash Management Obligations or Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Cash Management Obligations or such Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. 

Section 10.16 Withholding Taxes . To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax (for the avoidance of doubt, including backup withholding). If any Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements of Section 3.01, as applicable (it being understood that the documentation required under such Sections shall be delivered to the participating Lender)), 3.04 and 3.05 (through the applicable Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender. 

(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights . A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Lender that sells a participation or has a loan funded by an SPC shall (acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower) maintain a register complying with the requirements of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations) issued thereunder relating to the exemption from withholding for portfolio interest on which is entered the name and address of each Participant or SPC and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s or SPC s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register ).

(f) Liens on Loans . Any Lender may, at any time without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(g) with the prior written consent of the Borrower, 

(h) to any rating agency when required by it (it being understood that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from such Lender), or 

(i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than by reason of disclosure in breach of this Section 11.08 by any of the Administrative Agent, any Supplemental Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks or the Lenders, (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lead Arranger, any Lender, any Issuing Bank, or any of their respective Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, and which source is not known by such Person to be subject to a confidentiality restriction in respect thereof in favor of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower or (iii) is independently developed by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lead Arranger, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any of their respective Affiliates without reliance on any other confidential information. 

In addition, each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and customary information about this Agreement to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Loans, and to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

 Each Lender acknowledges that improper disclosure of Information may irreparably harm the Borrower and its Affiliates. Because money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to seek and obtain specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief on an emergency, temporary, preliminary and/or permanent basis, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, without first being required to demonstrate actual damages or post any security or bond.

The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender or such Issuing Bank or Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 

Section 11.10 Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents with respect to any of the Obligations, shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate ). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, 

Exhibit A 

or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. If the rate of interest under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Maximum Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. 

Section 11.11 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all other agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

Section 11.13 Survival . All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing or issuance of a Letter of Credit, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit remain outstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of each Loan Party set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.04, 11.04, 11.05 and 11.09 and the agreements of the Lenders set forth in Sections 2.15, 10.03 and 10.07 shall survive the satisfaction of the Termination Conditions, and the termination hereof.

The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

Exhibit A
