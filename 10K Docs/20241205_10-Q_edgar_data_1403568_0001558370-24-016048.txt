References in the following discussion to we, us, our, Ulta Beauty, the Company, and similar references mean Ulta Beauty, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. Overview We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance. Today, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of approximately 25,000 beauty and wellness products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than 1,400 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels. The continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities across four foundational focus areas: 1) Assortment: curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts; 2) Experience: fostering authentic, empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage guests at every touchpoint; 3) Access: engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences; and 4) Loyalty: building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. We operate in an attractive and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, and believe our strong operating model, competitive advantages, and financial foundation, paired with our investments to drive our growth, position us to capture additional market share in the industry.

 Comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others. Over the long term, our growth strategy is to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel capabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to drive revenue growth, leverage fixed costs, improve merchandise margin, increase operating efficiencies, and grow other revenue, partially offset by incremental investments in new stores and technology to enhance the guest experience, people, assortment, advertising, and depreciation. Current Trends Industry trends Our research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. The overall beauty market expanded in 2023 and into the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, supported by on-going consumer engagement with the beauty category. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term. Impact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends Persistent inflationary and macroeconomic pressures have impacted consumer spending habits broadly, which we believe may have contributed to lower sales trends through the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024. The continuation of inflationary and macroeconomic pressures could lead to a recession and further impact our ability to grow sales and maintain historical profitability levels. In addition, inflation could cause the interest rates on any future debt to remain at an elevated level or increase. Basis of presentation The Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce. We recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage. Comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14 th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13 th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53 rd week of comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales. 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 Measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results: the general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels; the introduction of new products or brands; the location of new stores in existing store markets; competition; our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences; the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; shipping and handling costs for e-commerce orders; retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses; salon services payroll and benefits; and shrink and inventory valuation reserves. 
 Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses include: payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees; advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs. 
 This presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses. Pre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising. Interest income, net represents interest from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising or elevated interest rates. Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.

 Results of operations Our quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Company s third quarter in fiscal 2024 and 2023 ended on November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. The following tables present the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:

 Comparison of 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 to 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 Net sales Net sales increased 41.2 million, or 1.7 , to 2.53 billion for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 2.49 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The net sales increase was primarily due to new store contribution, partially offset by a 4.9 million decline in other revenue. The comparable sales increase of 0.6 for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 was driven by a 0.5 increase in transactions and a 0.1 increase in average ticket. Gross profit Gross profit increased 13.6 million, or 1.4 , to 1.0 billion for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 992.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.7 for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 39.9 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs and lower other revenue, partially offset by favorable channel mix and lower inventory shrink. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased 20.9 million, or 3.2 , to 682.3 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 661.4 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 27.0 for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 26.6 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead, primarily due to strategic investments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses were 4.9 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Interest income, net Interest income, net was 1.7 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 2.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had 199.7 million and 195.4 million, respectively, outstanding under the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of February 3, 2024. Income tax expense Income tax expense of 78.0 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 24.4 , compared to 80.2 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Net income Net income was 242.2 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 249.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in net income is primarily due to the 20.9 million increase in SG A expenses and the 1.4 million increase in pre-opening expenses, partially offset by the 13.6 million increase in gross profit and the 2.2 million decrease in income taxes. Comparison of 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 to 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 Net sales Net sales increased 155.0 million, or 2.0 , to 7.8 billion for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 7.7 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The net sales increase was primarily due to new store contribution and 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 a 10.0 million increase in other revenue. The comparable sales increase of 0.3 for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 was driven by a 0.3 increase in average ticket. Gross profit Gross profit was 3.1 billion for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 3.0 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.1 for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 39.7 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower merchandise margin, partially offset by deleverage of store fixed costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A expenses increased 118.8 million, or 6.3 , to 2.0 billion for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 1.9 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 25.5 for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 24.5 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, primarily due to deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits, and store expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses were 12.0 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 5.4 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Interest income, net Interest income, net was 13.1 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 14.3 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had 199.7 million and 195.4 million, respectively, outstanding under the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of February 3, 2024. Income tax expense Income tax expense of 253.9 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 23.9 , compared to 278.6 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 23.7 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. Net income Net income was 807.8 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 896.6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in net income is primarily due to the 118.8 million increase in SG A expenses and the 6.6 million increase in pre-opening expenses, partially offset by the 24.7 million decrease in income taxes and the 13.1 million increase in gross profit. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories, cash and cash equivalents, and receivables, reduced by accounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued liabilities. As of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 177.8 million, 766.6 million, and 121.8 million, respectively. Our primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our information technology systems.

Table of Contents 
 Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease expenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season. Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments. We generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. We believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term. Cash flows We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows: 

39 Weeks Ended November 2, October 28, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 302,041 358,011 Net cash used in investing activities (306,644) (315,900) Net cash used in financing activities (584,209) (658,177) Operating activities Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 was mainly due to the decrease in net income, the timing of accrued income taxes, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accrued liabilities, accounts payable, and deferred revenue, partially offset by a lower increase in merchandise inventories in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, a decrease in net other assets and liabilities, and an increase in depreciation and amortization. Merchandise inventories, net were 2.4 billion at November 2, 2024 compared to 2.3 billion at October 28, 2023, representing an increase of 43.9 million or 1.9 . The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the addition of 63 net new stores opened since October 28, 2023. Investing activities We have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments, and investments in information technology systems. Investing activities for capital expenditures were 300.5 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 311.0 million during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. During the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, we opened 57 new stores, closed five stores, relocated two stores, and remodeled 36 stores, compared to the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, when we opened 20 new stores, closed one store, relocated five stores, and remodeled 16 stores. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures for information technology systems, supply chain

Table of Contents 
 investments, and store maintenance, partially offset by higher capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores and merchandising fixtures, compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023. Our future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems, and supply chain investments we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures. Financing activities Financing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions. Purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the dollar amount of share repurchases. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had 199.7 million and 195.4 million, respectively, outstanding under the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of February 3, 2024. Share repurchase program In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to 2.0 billion of the Company s common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time. In March 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the March 2024 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to 2.0 billion of the Company s common stock. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time. In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the October 2024 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 3.0 billion of the Company s common stock. The October 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorization revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the March 2024 Share Repurchase Program. The October 2024 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. A summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table: 

39 Weeks Ended November 2, October 28, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Shares repurchased 1,869,314 1,821,426 Total cost of shares repurchased, including excise tax 771.5 848.4 Credit facility On March 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association,

 as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party thereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 13, 2029, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of 800.0 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and satisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a 50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional 200.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of the Company s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Company s election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0.5 to 1.0 or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of 1.5 to 2.0 , and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 , with such margins based on the Company s borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.25 to 0.375 per annum. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had 199.7 million and 195.4 million, respectively, outstanding under the credit facility. The weighted average interest rate was 7.15 and 8.21 for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. As of February 3, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement. Seasonality Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother s Day and Valentine s Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Critical accounting policies and estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We continually monitor this risk and may develop strategies to manage it. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate risk We are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We had 199.7 million and 195.4 million outstanding on the credit facility as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of February 3, 2024. A hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would not have a material impact on our operating income for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the members of our senior management and Board of Directors. Based on management s evaluation as of November 2, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Part II - Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, Commitments and contingencies, for information on legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, financial results, or future performance. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The following table sets forth repurchases of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2024: 

Period Total number of shares purchased (1) Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under plans or programs (in thousands) (2) August 4, 2024 to August 31, 2024 226,000 345.91 226,000 1,492,756 September 1, 2024 to September 28, 2024 193,542 385.24 193,436 1,418,971 September 29, 2024 to November 2, 2024 312,205 374.81 312,022 2,945,284 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 731,747 368.64 731,458 2,945,284
