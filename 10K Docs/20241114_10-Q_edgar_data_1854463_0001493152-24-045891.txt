Following

in full on September 23, 2021, an aggregate amount of from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement

of the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the Public Shares if an Initial Business Combination has not been completed
in the required time period. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations
of the target business. 

The
Company initially had 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021 to consummate the Initial Business
Combination. On November 30, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved an amendment
(the November 2022 Extension Amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended,
the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date (the Termination Date by which the Company must consummate
an Initial Business Combination from December 17, 2022 (the Original Termination Date to January 17, 2023, and to allow

additional one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of the Company s

Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the
amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock at a conversion
price of per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at
the time of the Initial Public Offering. 

On
June 12, 2023, the Company held a second special meeting of stockholders (the June 2023 Extension Meeting ), at which the
stockholders approved, among other things, (i) an amendment (the June 2023 Extension Amendment to the Company s
Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another

On
June 3, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment
to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (the June 2024 Extension Amendment to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect
to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each time after July 17, 2024, by resolution
of the Company s board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable
Termination Date, until December 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2024, unless the closing of the Company s
Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such
extension. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of Public Shares properly exercised their
right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately . Following such redemptions, Public Shares remained outstanding. 

Following
the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note
in the principal amount of (the Fourth Extension Note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to
loan to the Company up to in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The Fourth Extension Note does not bear
interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and (b) the Company s liquidation.
In the event that the Company does not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Fourth Extension Note will be repaid only from
amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. 

Through
the date of this report, the Company has deposited into the Trust Account in connection with six drawdowns under the First Extension Note, six drawdowns
under Second Extension Note, six drawdowns under the Third Extension Notes, and six drawdowns
under the Fourth Extension Note (collectively the Extension Notes pursuant to the extension of the Termination Date to
December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all the holders of Public Shares upon the Company s liquidation
or (ii) holders of such shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension
Amendment (as defined below) or (b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
 and , respectively, was outstanding under the Extension Notes. 

If
the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, the Company will, as promptly as possible
but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held
in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable
and up to of interest to pay for dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, the Company may not
be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of the public stockholders.
In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Rights, Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless. 

No
compensation of any kind (including finders , consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of the existing officers, directors,
stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Initial
Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on the Company s behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from
the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management
after the Initial Business Combination is uncertain, the Company has no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid
to those persons after the Initial Business Combination. 

Management
intends to use any funds available outside of the Trust Account for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist
the Company with its search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company s insiders, officers and directors
in connection with activities as described below. 

The
allocation of the net proceeds available to the Company outside of the Trust Account, along with the interest earned on the funds held
in the Trust Account available to pay for the Company s income and other tax liabilities, represents the best estimate of the intended
uses of these funds. In the event that the Company s assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the Company may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above-described categories. If the estimate of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating the Initial
Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to the Company from the Trust
Account is insufficient, the Company may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, the Company could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor
or third parties. The Sponsor and/or founding stockholders may, but are not obligated to, loan funds as may be required. Such loans would
be evidenced by promissory notes that would either be paid upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination, or, with respect to
certain of such notes, at such lender s discretion , converted upon consummation of
the Initial Business Combination into Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant. However, the Sponsor
and/or founding stockholders are under no obligation to loan the Company any funds or invest in the Company. If the Company is unable
to obtain the necessary funds, the Company may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate without completing our
Initial Business Combination. 

The
Company will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the sale of the
Additional Private Placement Warrants, including the funds held in the Trust Account, in connection with the Initial Business Combination
and to pay for expenses relating thereto, including the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in
an amount equal to 3.5 of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination. To
the extent that the Company s capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect the Initial Business Combination,
the proceeds held in the Trust Account which are not used to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be disbursed to the combined
company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business 
operations or for strategic acquisitions. 

To
the extent the Company is unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Company will pay the costs of liquidation from the
remaining assets outside of the Trust Account and from up to of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of
income and other tax obligations) that may be released to it to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, the Sponsor
has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

On
May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Original Business Combination Agreement ), by
and among WinVest, WinVest Merger Sub I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, WinVest Merger
Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of WinVest, Xtribe P.L.C., a public limited company incorporated
and registered in England and Wales with number 07878011 Xtribe PLC ), and Xtribe Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Xtribe PLC. On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination
Agreement (the A R Business Combination Agreement ), by and among WinVest, WinVest (BVI) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands

Risks
and Uncertainties 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, . However, for purposes of calculating the excise
tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value
of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury (the Treasury Department has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and
prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022,
in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent
the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a business combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on
a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Initial Business Combination,
extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE (Private
Investment in Public Entity) or other equity issuances in connection with a business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection
with a business combination but issued within the same taxable year of a business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and
other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming
holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the
cash available on hand to complete a business combination and in the Company s ability to complete a business combination. The
Company will not use the proceeds placed in the Trust Account and the interest earned thereon to pay any excise taxes that may be imposed
on it pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax imposed under the IR Act,
on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. 

In
June 2023, the Company s stockholders redeemed Public Shares for a total of . In November 2023, the Company s
stockholders redeemed Public Shares for a total of . In
June 2024, the Company s stockholders redeemed Public Shares for a total of . The
Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the stock redemption under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 450, Contingencies ASC 450 ). ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists the likelihood that the future event
will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability
must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status and probability
of completing a business combination as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and determined that a contingent liability should
be calculated and recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded and , respectively,
of excise tax liability calculated as of total shares redeemed. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. The Company is
currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation. 

Use
of Funds Restricted for Payment of Taxes 

In
February 2024, the Company withdrew of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account and received a tax refund of
 that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. Such amounts were restricted for
payment of the Company s tax liabilities as provided in the Company s charter. During the first quarter of 2024, approximately
 of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Sponsor replenished to the
Company s operating account in the form of a working capital loan. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, approximately of interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account was withdrawn and inadvertently
used for the payments of general operating expenses. The Company s initial business combination target, Xtribe, has agreed to replenish
the Company s operating account for approximately . 

Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . The Company s
liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering have been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related
party, the Sponsor, and from the issuance of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has
been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from the Sponsor s purchase
of Private Placement Warrants held outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company had a net loss of and expenses from operating activities were , mainly due to costs associated with
professional services, including legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance expenses. The Company intends to use
the funds held outside the Trust Account, in addition to additional funds that the Company may borrow under the October 2023 Promissory
Note (as defined below), primarily to pay corporate filing and compliance expenses, evaluate target businesses, perform business due
diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure,
negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination. Per the terms of the Extension Notes, funds available under such notes are not
restricted for use for extension payments. The Company believes it will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate an
Initial Business Combination. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which assumes
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the
Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024
relates to the Company s formation, the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business
Combination and working to consummate an Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. The Company will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income
in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from
the Initial Public Offering. The Company s ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating a business
combination. Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public
Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business
combination. Although management has been successful to date in raising necessary funding, there can be no assurance that any
required future financing can be successfully completed. Additionally, the Company does not currently have sufficient working
capital. Furthermore, the Company s ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the contractual time period
is uncertain. The Company currently has until December 17, 2024 to consummate the Initial Business Combination. The Company will not
be able to consummate an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024. Based on these circumstances, management has
determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern due to the uncertainty
of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year. 

Management s
plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation extending the Company s current Termination Date, among other things. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on November 1, 2024, the Company is proposing to
amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to January 17, 2025 (the Charter
Extension Date upon the deposit into the Trust Account of ,
to be loaned to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the
Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an
additional one month period each after the Charter Extension Date (each, an Additional Extension ), by resolution of
the Company s board of directors, if requested by the Company s Sponsor, and upon five days advance notice prior
to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing
of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional 
per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees.

Warrants was placed in the Trust Account and may be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less,
in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations or in cash. To mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment
company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), prior to the 24-month anniversary
of the effective date of the Company s IPO Registration Statement, the Company instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government
treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to maintain all funds in the Trust Account in cash
in an interest-bearing bank account. The funds were reinvested into money market funds in May 2024. The Trust Account is intended as
a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption
of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation
(A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete
the Initial Business Combination by the Termination Date or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights
or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; or (iii) absent the consummation of an Initial Business Combination by the Termination
Date, the return of the funds held in the Trust Account to the public stockholders as part of redemption of the Public Shares. 

ASC
740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments,
accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities. 

While
ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual
elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated
due to the potential impact of the timing of any Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized
during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3
which states, If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (benefit) but is otherwise
able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim
period in which the item is reported. The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly
take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the
Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2024.
The Company s effective tax rate was ) and ) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
Company s effective tax rate was ) and ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective
tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to non-deductible
transaction costs and changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. 

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced
losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.

board service for its Sponsor to transfer an aggregate of of its Founder Shares to the Company s directors for no cash
consideration and an aggregate of of its Founder Shares to certain members of the Company s advisory board for no cash consideration,
for a total of shares, approximating the fair value of the shares on such date, or . The shares were subsequently transferred
prior to the effectiveness of the Company s registration statement. The Founder Shares do not have redemption rights and will be

Private

Our
Sponsor purchased from us an aggregate of Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of per warrant, or 
in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. A portion of the
proceeds received from the purchase equal to was placed in the Trust Account so that at least per share sold to the
public in the Initial Public Offering is held in the Trust Account. 

March
2021 Promissory Note Related Party 

On
March 16, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (extended by amendment in March 2022 to the consummation
of an Initial Business Combination) (the March 2021 Promissory Note ), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to
an aggregate principal amount of , of which was outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummates
its Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the amount outstanding under the March 2021
Promissory Note into Private Placement Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price of per
warrant, and each warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one-half share of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price
of per share, commencing on the date of the Initial Business Combination of the Company, and otherwise on the terms of the Private
Placement Warrants. 

The
Company analyzed the conversion feature of the March 2021 Promissory Note into private warrants under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ,
ASC 450, Contingencies , ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with
Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).
 Prior to any Initial Business Combination, the outstanding amounts under the March 2021 Promissory Note are recorded as a liability
on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should
be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants,
being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion
feature is not material as of the latest drawdown date, and the reporting date, or September 30, 2024, management has not recorded any
such adjustment to the Company s financial statements. 

October
2023 Promissory Note Related Party 

On

(ii) holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) the vote to approve the Charter Extension

The
Company analyzed the conversion feature of the First and Second Extension Notes into private warrants under ASC 815, Derivatives and
Hedging , ASC 450, Contingencies , ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic

on the balance sheet. The conversion feature for any such outstanding amounts requires liability treatment on the balance sheet and should
be recorded at fair value with changes to the fair value being recorded through the income statement. Once converted, the private warrants,
being identical to the Public Warrants, will be classified under equity treatment. However, given that the fair value of such conversion

Rights 

The
registration statement pursuant to which the Company registered its securities offered in the Initial Public Offering was declared effective
on September 14, 2021. On September 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of Units. Each Unit consists
of one share of Common Stock of the Company, par value per share, one redeemable warrant, with each Public Warrant entitling
the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of per whole share, subject to
adjustment, and one Right, with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common Stock
upon the consummation by the Company of an Initial Business Combination. Each Right may be traded separately. If the Company is unable
to complete an Initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account,
holders of Rights will not receive any such funds for their Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. 

Public
Warrants 

Each
redeemable warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one half of one share of Common Stock at a price of per full share,
subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of the completion of an Initial Business Combination and
12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective
and current registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus
relating to such shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within 90 days from the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, warrant
holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain
an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the consummation
of an Initial Business Combination. 

The
Company may call the outstanding warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon
conversion of working capital loans), in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant: 

at
 any time while the warrants are exercisable; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock
 splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on
 the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders (the Force-Call Provision ), and 

if,
 and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants
 at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the
 date of redemption. 

The
right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and
after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder s
warrant upon surrender of such warrant. 

The
redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium
to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise
price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below
the exercise price of the warrants. 

If
the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management of the Company will have the option to require all holders
that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. 

In
addition, if (x) per share of Common
Stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors), (y)
the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available
for funding the Initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock
during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the Initial Business Combination
(such price, the Market Value is below per share, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be
equal to 115 of the Market Value, and the last sales price of the Common Stock that triggers the Company s right to redeem the
Warrants pursuant to Section 6.1 below shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165 of the Market Value. 

The
Private Placement Warrants, as well as any warrants the Company issues to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their
affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be identical to the warrants underlying the Units offered in
the Initial Public Offering.

such sum into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from October 17, 2024 to November 17, 2024.
Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company s liquidation or (ii) holders
of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a
vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the
consummation of a Business Combination. 

November
 Extension 

On November
14, 2024, the Company effected the sixth drawdown of under the Fourth Promissory Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum
into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination Date from November 17, 2024 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts
will be distributed either to: (i) all of the holders of Public Shares upon the Company s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public
Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company s
Certificate of Incorporation or (b) the consummation of a Business Combination. 

Special
Meeting of Stockholders 

On
November 1, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to extend
the Termination Date from December 17, 2024 to the Charter Extension Date upon the deposit into the Trust Account of , to be loaned
to the Company by the Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow the Company, without another
stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to for up to five Additional Extensions, by resolution of the Company s
board of directors, if requested by the Company s Sponsor, and upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable Termination
Date, until June 17, 2025, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination
shall have occurred prior thereto, subject to the deposit of an additional per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by
the Sponsor or its affiliates, members or third-party designees. If the proposal to extend the Termination Date is approved and effective,
the Company s stockholders may elect to redeem their shares of Common Stock. An electing stockholder will be entitled to receive
a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes
payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding shares of Common Stock issued as part of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering.
This redemption right will apply to each public stockholder regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal
from the Trust Account of such amounts would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of
the Company held by the Sponsor.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Initial Business
Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering
(the Initial Public Offering ), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

23 

As
of September 30, 2024 and the date of this filing, we had not commenced core operations. All activity for the period from March 1, 2021
(inception) through September 30, 2024 related to our formation, raising funds through our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target
company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe (as defined below).
We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate
non-operating income in the form of interest and dividend income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. 

The
stock exchange listing rules provide that the Initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have
a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the assets held in a trust account (the Trust Account in the
United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company Continental ), as trustee (excluding the deferred
underwriting commissions and taxes payable), at the time of the our signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Initial Business
Combination. We will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-Initial Business Combination company owns or acquires
50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target company or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target company
sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment
Company Act ). There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the Certificate of Incorporation provided that we had until
December 17, 2022 to complete an Initial Business Combination; provided, however, that if we anticipated we may not be able to consummate
an Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2022, we, by resolution of the board of directors if requested by our sponsor, WinVest
SPAC LLC (the Sponsor ), could extend the period of time to consummate an Initial Business Combination up to two times,
each by an additional three months (up until June 17, 2023), subject to the deposit of additional funds into the Trust Account by our
Sponsor or its affiliates or designees. On November 30, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the November 2022 Extension
Meeting to, among other things, approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we must
consummate an Initial Business Combination (the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and to allow
us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional
one month each time after January 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days 
advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after the original Termination
Date of December 17, 2022, unless the closing of the Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the November
2022 Extension Amendment ). Our Sponsor agreed that if the November 2022 Extension Amendment was approved at the November 2022
Extension Meeting, it or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees would lend to us up to 750,000 to be deposited
into the Trust Account. 

The
stockholders approved the November 2022 Extension Amendment at the November 2022 Extension Meeting. Accordingly, on December 5, 2022,
we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 750,000 (the First Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant
to which our Sponsor agreed to loan to us up to 750,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date. The First Extension
Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of the Initial Business Combination and (b) our liquidation.
In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the First Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining
outside of the Trust Account, if any. Upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any
portion or all of the amount outstanding under the First Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our common stock,
par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), at a conversion price of 0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will
be identical to the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) issued to our Sponsor at the time of our Initial Public Offering. The
balance on the First Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 750,000. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Common Stock issued as
part of the Units (as defined below) sold in our Initial Public Offering Public Shares properly exercised their right
to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.20 per share, for
an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 98.0 million.

On
June 12, 2023, we held a second special meeting of stockholders (the June 2023 Extension Meeting at which the stockholders
approved, among other things, (i) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the June 2023 Extension Amendment to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to July 17, 2023, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend
the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month (or such shorter period as may be requested by
the Sponsor) after July 17, 2023, by resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days advance
notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until December 17, 2023, or a total of up to six months after June 17, 2023, unless
the closing of our Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto, and (ii) an amendment (the Redemption Limitation
Amendment to eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that we may not consummate any business combination
unless we have net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 upon consummation of such business combination. Following stockholder approval
of the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment at the June 2023 Extension Meeting, on June 16, 2023, we
filed the June 2023 Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State. 

In
connection with the approval of the June 2023 Extension Amendment on June 12, 2023, on June 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory

consummate an Initial Business Combination, the Second Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust
Account, if any. Upon the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of the
amount outstanding under the Second Extension Note into private warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price
of 0.50 per private warrant. Such private warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor at the
time of the Initial Public Offering. The balance on the Second Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 390,000. 

In

resolution of our board of directors, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable Termination
Date, until June 17, 2024, or a total of up to six months after December 17, 2023, unless the closing of our Initial Business Combination
shall have occurred prior thereto, by causing 55,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account for each such extension. 

In
connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023 ,
on December 13, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of 330,000 (the Third Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to 330,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date.
The Third Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of (a) the closing of an Initial Business Combination and

with Xtribe PLC, Xtribe ), which amends and restates the Original Business Combination Agreement in its entirety. 

On

Certificate of Incorporation (the June 2024 Extension Amendment to extend the Termination Date from June 17, 2024 to July 17, 2024, and to allow us, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend

Following
the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal
amount of 180,000 (the Fourth Extension Note, and collectively with the First Extension Note, the Second Extension Note

The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 120,000 and 0, respectively. 

Through
the date of this report, we have effected drawdowns of 1,650,000 under the Extension Notes and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection
with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to December 17, 2024. Such amounts will be distributed either to:

in connection with (a) a vote to approve certain specified amendments to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or
(b) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. 

If
we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not
more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of our outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the
Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up
to 100,000 of interest to pay our dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute
such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our
dissolution and liquidation, the Rights (as defined below) and Public and Private Placement Warrants will expire and will be worthless. 

Results
of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 

All
activities through September 30, 2024 were related to our organizational activities, preparation for our Initial Public Offering, and,
after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial
Business Combination with Xtribe. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Subsequent to our Initial Public Offering on September 17, 2021, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest and dividends
on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the Trust Account. There has been no significant change in our trading
position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We incur ongoing expenses as
a result of being a public company for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance, as well as for due diligence expenses. 

26 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was 1,430,395 and expenses from operating activities were 1,724,753, as compared
to a net loss of 966,681 and expenses from operating activities of 1,476,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases
were mainly due to an increase in legal and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 due to efforts being made to complete our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We intend to use our operating
cash held outside the Trust Account primarily to evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses,
travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review
corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an Initial Business
Combination. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 548 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of 4,928,551, as compared to 37,946
in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of 2,717,064 as of December 31, 2023. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation
of the Initial Public Offering had been satisfied through proceeds from advances from a related party, our Sponsor, and from the issuance
of Common Stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds
from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from our Sponsor s purchase of Private Placement Warrants held
outside of our Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor. We believe we will need to access additional liquidity in order to consummate
an Initial Business Combination. 

On
March 16, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, which note was amended on March 27, 2022 (the March 2021
Promissory Note ), pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000, of which 300,000 was outstanding
under the March 2021 Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The March 2021 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing
and payable on the date on which we consummate an Initial Business Combination. The Sponsor may elect to convert any portion or all of
the amount outstanding under the March 2021 Promissory Note into warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price
of 0.50 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to acquire one-half share of Common Stock at an exercise price of
 11.50 per whole share, commencing on the date of our Initial Business Combination. No such conversions have yet occurred. During 2023,
we effected drawdowns of 300,000 under the March 2021 Promissory Note. These amounts remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The
purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business
Combination. 

On
September 17, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one
share of Common Stock, one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrant ), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment, and one
right (the Right ), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-fifteenth (1/15) of one share of Common
Stock upon the consummation by us of an Initial Business Combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of 100,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, we completed the private sale of 10,000,000
warrants (the Private Placement Warrants, and collectively with the Public Warrants, the Warrants at a price
of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 5,000,000 (such sale, the Private Placement ).
Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at a price of 11.50 per
whole share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants. 

On
September 23, 2021, our underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 1,500,000 Units (the Over-Allotment
Units ), generating gross proceeds of 15,000,000 on September 27, 2021. Simultaneously with the sale of Over-Allotment Units,
we consummated a private sale of an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants (the Additional Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of 450,000.

paid a total of 2,400,000 in underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions (not including deferred underwriting commissions of 4,025,000
payable only upon completion of our Initial Business Combination) and 523,969 for other costs and expenses related to the Initial Public
Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and overallotment of 112,076,031. 

As
of September 27, 2021, a total of 116,150,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement
Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account, and we had 638,000 of cash held outside
of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. 

On
December 5, 2022, we issued the First Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of 750,000. On December 5, 2022, we effected
the first drawdown of 125,000 under the First Extension Note and caused the Sponsor to deposit such sum into the Trust Account in connection
with the extension of the Termination Date from December 17, 2022 to January 17, 2023. During 2023, we effected drawdowns of 625,000
under the First Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension of the Termination
Date from January 17, 2023 to June 17, 2023. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the November 2022 Extension Amendment, the holders of 9,606,887 shares of Public Shares properly
exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately
 10.20 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 98.0 million. 

On
June 13, 2023, we issued the Second Extension Note to our Sponsor in the principal amount of 390,000. During 2023, we effected drawdowns
of 390,000 under the Second Extension Note and caused such sums to be deposited into the Trust Account in connection with the extension
of the Termination Date from June 17, 2023 to December 17, 2023. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the June 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 627,684 shares of Public Shares properly exercised
their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.71 per
share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 6,721,795. 

On
October 31, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor (the October 2023 Promissory Note ), pursuant to
which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount
of 1,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had effected drawdowns of 709,200 under the
October 2023 Promissory Note. The October 2023 Promissory Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Initial Business
Combination. In the event that we do not consummate an Initial Business Combination, the October 2023 Promissory Note will be repaid
only from amounts remaining outside of the Trust Account, if any. The purpose of each drawdown is for the payment of expenses associated
with operations and those necessary to initiate an Initial Business Combination. 

In
connection with the approval of the November 2023 Extension Amendment on November 30, 2023, on December 13, 2023, we issued the Third
Extension Note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to 330,000 in connection with the extension of the
Termination Date. The balance on the Third Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was 330,000. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the November 2023 Extension Amendment, the holders of 122,306 shares of Public Shares properly exercised
their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.81 per
share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 1,322,518. Following such redemptions, 1,143,123 shares of Public Shares
remained outstanding. 

In
connection with the approval of the June 2024 Extension Amendment on June 3, 2024, on June 12, 2024, we issued the Fourth Extension Note
to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to 180,000 in connection with the extension of the Termination Date.
The balance on the Fourth Extension Note as of September 30, 2024 was 120,000. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the June 2024 Extension Amendment, the holders of 650,790 Public Shares properly exercised their
right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.32 per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 7,367,204. Following such redemptions, 492,333 Public Shares remained outstanding. 

28 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of approximately 5.8 million. We intend to use substantially all of the
remaining funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall
be net of taxes payable, to complete our Initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes and
up to 100,000 of dissolution expenses, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to consummate an Initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which assumes the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations.
All activity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to identifying
a target company for an Initial Business Combination and working to consummate our Initial Business Combination with Xtribe. We will
not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating
income in the form of interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from the proceeds derived from
the Initial Public Offering. Our ability to commence operations is contingent upon consummating an Initial Business Combination. We currently
have until December 17, 2024 to consummate our Initial Business Combination, which is 39 months from the closing of our Initial Public
Offering. We will not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination by December 17, 2024. 

Management s
plan to address the December 17, 2024 liquidation is to seek stockholder approval for, and to file, an amendment to our Certificate
of Incorporation. Pursuant to a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on
November 1, 2024, we are proposing to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Termination Date from December 17,
2024 to January 17, 2025 (the Charter Extension Date upon the deposit into the Trust Account of 30,000, to be loaned
to us by our Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees, and to allow us, without another
stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date on a monthly basis for up to five times by an additional one month each
time after the Charter Extension Date (each, an Additional Extension ), by resolution of our board of directors, if
requested by our Sponsor, and upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until June 17, 2025, or
a total of up to six months after December 17, 2024, unless the closing of an Initial Business Combination shall have occurred prior
thereto, subject to the deposit an additional 30,000 per Additional Extension into the Trust Account by our Sponsor or its
affiliates, members or third-party designees (the Charter Extension Amendment ). If the Charter Extension Amendment is
approved and effective, our public stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares. An electing stockholder will be entitled to
receive a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest
(net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares. This redemption right will apply to each holder of
Public Shares regardless of whether and how such holder votes on the proposal. The removal from the Trust Account of such amounts
would reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company held by our Sponsor. Due
to the reasons stated above, we believe we may not have sufficient liquidity through the date of an Initial Business Combination, if
extended through June 17, 2025. 

To
the extent we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination, we will need to pay the costs of liquidation from our current
available funds outside the Trust Account, including the approximate amount of 290,800 still available to us under the October 2023
Promissory Note as of September 30, 2024, and from up to 100,000 of interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income
and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to pay for dissolution expenses. If such funds are insufficient, our Sponsor has
agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Based on these
circumstances, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to insufficient
liquidity, the uncertainty of liquidity requirements and the mandatory liquidation date within one year. 

Accordingly,
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company
as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

29 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024,
other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative support services
provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on September 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the
earlier of the completion of an Initial Business Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

Deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds raised in the Initial Public Offering, or 4,025,000,
will be payable to the underwriters upon the consummation of our Initial Business Combination and will be held in the Trust Account until
the consummation of such Initial Business Combination. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. We do not participate
in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management
has determined that the Company has no critical accounting estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820) ASU 2022-03 ). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity
security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value.
The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction.
The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The
provisions in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities. Early adoption
is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the balance
sheets, results of operations and cash flows. 

ASU
2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information
on income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early
adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. We do not expect to early adopt
this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows. 

We
do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our financial statements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive
officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officer ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting related to the protection of funds permitted for withdrawal from the Trust Account, the Company s
non-compliance with the investment management trust agreement and incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 15, 2024, except as set
forth below: 

There
are no assurances that the Charter Extension Amendment will enable us to complete an Initial Business Combination. 

Approving
the Charter Extension Amendment involves a number of risks. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, we can provide no assurances
that the Initial Business Combination will be consummated prior to June 17, 2025. Our ability to consummate any Initial Business Combination
is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are required to offer stockholders the opportunity to
redeem shares in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Extension Amendment, and we will be required to offer stockholders redemption
rights again in connection with any stockholder vote to approve the Initial Business Combination. Even if the Charter Extension Amendment
is approved by our stockholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate the Initial Business
Combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the
Charter Extension Amendment vote and the Initial Business Combination vote could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with
a redemption offer or liquidation, our stockholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Public Shares
on the open market. The price of our Public Shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose
of their Public Shares at favorable prices, or at all. 

31 

The
Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities following our Initial Business Combination,
hinder our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection
with a liquidation. 

On
August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise
tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by covered corporations beginning on January 1, 2023, with certain exceptions
(the Excise Tax ). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the
stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of
the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value
of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. 

The
U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance
regarding the Excise Tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations
and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded
domestic corporations are exempt from the Excise Tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year in which a liquidation
is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Redemptions of our Public Shares in connection with an amendment to our Certificate of
Incorporation or in connection with an Initial Business Combination may subject us to the Excise Tax unless one of the two exceptions
above apply. 

If
the Charter Extension Amendment is approved, our public stockholders will have the right to require us to redeem their public stock.
Any redemption or other repurchase that we make in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment may be subject to the Excise Tax.
Consequently, the value of our stockholder s investment in our securities may decrease and the amount our stockholders may receive
upon redemption may be negatively impacted as a result of the Excise Tax to the extent we do not liquidate by December 31, 2024. Whether
and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of
the redemptions and repurchases in connection with our Initial Business Combination, (ii) the structure of an Initial Business Combination,
(iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with an Initial Business Combination (or
otherwise issued not in connection with an Initial Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of an Initial Business
Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the Excise Tax
would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the Excise Tax have not been determined.
The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available for a stockholder redemption, could cause a reduction in the cash available
to complete an Initial Business Combination and could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete an Initial Business Combination. 

We
are required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules to consummate an Initial Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO
Registration Statement. As a result of our failure to consummate an Initial Business Combination within this time period, our securities
could be subject to delisting. 

Pursuant
to IM-5101-2(b) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we must consummate an Initial Business Combination by the 36-month anniversary of the effectiveness
of our IPO Registration Statement, or September 14, 2024 (the Nasdaq Deadline ). We did not complete an Initial Business
Combination prior to the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, we are in violation of Nasdaq IM-5101-2. 

32 

As
previously reported, on September 17, 2024, we received a written notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Capital Market, LLC Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules IM-5101-2.
On September 24, 2024, we timely requested a hearing before The Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), which was held on November
12, 2024. As of the date of this filing, we have not yet received a written decision from the Panel with the results of the hearing.
Our securities will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. However,
there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on Nasdaq. If the
Panel does not grant our request, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Additionally, even if the Panel grants our request, the
proposed extension of the Termination Date to June 17, 2025 would exceed the six-month extension the Company has requested from the Panel
(the Nasdaq Extension ). As a result, if the Nasdaq Extension is granted and the Charter Extension Amendment is approved
but we do not complete an Initial Business Combination prior to the expiration of the Nasdaq Extension, Nasdaq may issue a Staff Delisting
Determination under Rule 5810 to delist our securities. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face
significant material adverse consequences, including: 

the
 price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with being listed on Nasdaq 

holders
 may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so 

we
 may become subject to shareholder litigation 

we
 may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities 

we
 may lose media and analyst coverage and 

we
 would likely lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter
 markets, if at all. 

Nasdaq
may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our stockholders in connection with approval of the Charter
Extension Amendment, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading
restrictions. 

Our
Common Stock, Units, Warrants and Rights are listed on Nasdaq. After the Stockholder Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance
with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing
requirements for our Common Stock include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders, at least 500,000
publicly held shares and a market value of publicly held shares of 1.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation,
in connection with the Charter Extension Amendment, stockholders may elect to redeem their Public Shares and, as a result, we may not
be in compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. 

If
our securities do not meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange.
If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved
national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we
could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities,
(ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our Public Shares are a penny stock, which will require
brokers trading in our Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule
419 of the Securities Act, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities,
(iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company, (v) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain
additional financing in the future, and (vi) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business
combination. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from
regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Our Common Stock, Units, Warrants
and Rights qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify
as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

33 

The
Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company is unable to develop and
maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report its financial
results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and materially and adversely affect the Company s
business and operating results. 

During
the preparation of the Company s financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified
a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to incorrectly filing income taxes in the state of Delaware.
The Company filed an amended return in Delaware and will file its income tax returns in the U.S., Massachusetts, and Florida jurisdictions. 

During
the preparation of the Company s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the period ended March
31, 2024, the Company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to its Trust Account withdrawals.
In 2023, the Company withdrew 898,940 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account, which was restricted for payment
of the Company s tax liabilities as provided in the Company s Certificate of Incorporation. In the period ended March 31,
2024, the Company withdrew 40,050 of interest and dividend income earned in the Trust Account and received a tax refund of 104,305
that was previously paid with the interest and dividend income earned on the Trust Account. During both the year ended December 31, 2023
and the periods ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, portions of these funds were inadvertently used for the payments of general operating
expenses. Such amounts were disbursed without appropriate review and approval to ensure that the disbursements were made in accordance
with the investment management trust agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company and the Company. As a result of
this issue, management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review
and approval of cash disbursements.
