 million in cash Foursight Acquisition ). Foursight is an automobile finance company that purchases and services automobile retail installment contracts primarily made to near-prime borrowers across the country. Contracts are sourced through an extensive network of dealers. The acquisition supports our expansion into the auto lending business. 
 
 The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. 
 
 Fair value of assets acquired: Cash and cash equivalents Net finance receivables Allowance for finance receivable losses ) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents Other intangibles Other assets Fair value of liabilities assumed: 
 Long-term debt Other liabilities Goodwill 
 
 The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be adjusted during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition as further information becomes available. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. 
 
 The goodwill of million recognized from the Foursight Acquisition reflects the strategic benefits and opportunities of the combined company and is reported in our Consumer and Insurance C I segment. Tax deductible goodwill is million, reflecting differences in the allocation of purchase price for tax purposes. See Note 7 for a reconciliation of the carrying amount of goodwill at the beginning of 2024 and September 30, 2024. 
 
 Assets acquired include auto finance receivables with a fair value of million on gross receivables of million. Of this amount, we determined million of gross receivables have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination purchased credit deteriorated or PCD loans) and recorded an allowance for finance receivable losses for PCD loans of million at the acquisition date. The remaining loans were deemed to be non-PCD loans, and an additional million was recorded in our Allowance for finance receivable losses and recognized through Provision for finance receivable losses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The results of operations of Foursight are included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations subsequent to the acquisition date. We have omitted the pro forma disclosures because we have determined that the acquisition did not have a significant impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR 
 
 We consider the delinquency status of our finance receivables as our key credit quality indicator. We monitor the delinquency of our finance receivable portfolio, including the migration between the delinquency buckets and changes in the delinquency trends to manage our exposure to credit risk in the portfolio. 
 
 When consumer loans are days contractually past due, we consider these accounts to be at an increased risk for loss and move collection of these accounts to our central collection operations. We consider our consumer loans to be nonperforming at days or more contractually past due, at which point we stop accruing finance charges and reverse finance charges previously

 Unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale securities were less than 1 million and, therefore, were not quantified in the table above. 
 
 On a lot basis, we had and investment securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We do not consider the unrealized losses to be credit-related, as these unrealized losses primarily relate to changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, there were no credit impairments on investment securities that we intend to sell. We do not have plans to sell any of the remaining investment securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024, and we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be required to sell such investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
 
 We continue to monitor unrealized loss positions for potential credit impairments. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material credit impairments related to our investment securities. Therefore, there were no material additions or reductions in the allowance for credit losses (impairments recognized or reversed in earnings) on credit impaired available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The proceeds of available-for-sale securities sold or redeemed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled million and million, respectively.

 OUTLOOK 
 
 We are actively monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and remain prepared for any developments that may impact our business. Our financial condition and results of operations could be affected by macroeconomic conditions, including changes in unemployment, inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, and geopolitical actions outside of the U.S. We will continue to incorporate updates to our macroeconomic assumptions, as necessary, which could lead to further adjustments in our allowance for finance receivable losses, allowance ratio, and provision for finance receivable losses. 
 
 Our experienced management team remains focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with a long liquidity runway and adequate capital while maintaining a conservative and disciplined underwriting model. We believe we are well positioned to serve our customers and execute on our strategic priorities, including: 
 
 striving to be the lender of choice for nonprime consumers and improve their financial well-being; 
 continuing to grow our receivables through new products and distribution channels; 
 maintaining a rigorous underwriting standard with a goal of enhancing credit performance; 
 leveraging our scale and cost discipline across the Company to deliver improved operating leverage; and 
 maintaining a strong liquidity level with diversified funding sources. 
 
 We believe our commitment to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, retain disciplined underwriting, drive strategic growth initiatives, and maintain a robust balance sheet strengthens our ability to navigate challenges and seize opportunities. As we pursue our key initiatives, we are confident in our ability to increase shareholder value and remain resilient and adaptable to navigate an ever-evolving economic, social, political, and regulatory landscape.

 Interest income increased 115 million or 10 and 296 million or 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 due to growth in average net receivables. 
 
 Interest expense increased 34 million or 13 and 125 million or 17 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023 due to an increase in average debt to support our receivables growth and a higher average cost of funds. 
 
 Provision for finance receivable losses increased 102 million or 25 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for finance receivable losses driven by growth in our receivables, partially offset by an increase in recoveries in the current period. 
 
 Provision for finance receivable losses increased 243 million or 19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher net charge-offs related to growth in our receivables, including the impact of the Foursight Acquisition. The increase was partially offset by an increase in recoveries in the current period and a larger build in the allowance for finance receivable losses in the prior period.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Management uses C I adjusted pretax income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance measure of our segment. C I adjusted pretax income (loss) represents income (loss) before income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes restructuring charges, net gain or loss resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt, acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, regulatory settlements, and other items and strategic activities. Management believes C I adjusted pretax income (loss) is useful in assessing the profitability of our segment. 
 
 Management also uses C I pretax capital generation, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance measure of our segment. This measure represents C I adjusted pretax income as discussed above and excludes the change in our C I allowance for finance receivable losses in the period while still considering the C I net charge-offs incurred during the period. Management believes that C I pretax capital generation is useful in assessing the capital created in the period impacting the overall capital adequacy of the Company. Management believes that the Company s reserves, combined with its equity, represent the Company s loss absorption capacity. 
 
 Management utilizes both C I adjusted pretax income (loss) and C I pretax capital generation in evaluating our performance. Additionally, both of these non-GAAP measures are consistent with the performance goals established in OMH s executive compensation program. C I adjusted pretax income (loss) and C I pretax capital generation are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 OMH s reconciliations of income before income tax expense on a Segment Accounting Basis to C I adjusted pretax income (non-GAAP) and C I pretax capital generation (non-GAAP) were as follows:

 Credit Quality 
 
 FINANCE RECEIVABLES 
 
 Our net finance receivables, consisting of consumer loans and credit cards, were 23.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and 21.3 billion at December 31, 2023. We consider the delinquency status of our finance receivables as our key credit quality indicator. We monitor the delinquency of our finance receivable portfolio, including the migration between the delinquency buckets and changes in the delinquency trends to manage our exposure to credit risk in the portfolio. Our branch and central operation team members work closely with customers as necessary and offer a variety of borrower assistance programs to help support our customers. 
 
 DELINQUENCY 
 
 We monitor delinquency trends to evaluate the risk of future credit losses and employ advanced analytical tools to manage performance. Team members are actively engaged in collection activities throughout the early stages of delinquency. We closely track and report the percentage of receivables that are contractually 30-89 days past due as a benchmark of portfolio quality, collections effectiveness, and as a strong indicator of losses in coming quarters. 
 
 When consumer loans are contractually 60 days past due, we consider these accounts to be at an increased risk for loss and move collection of these accounts to our central collection operations. Use of our central operations teams for managing late-stage delinquency allows us to apply more advanced collection techniques and tools to drive credit performance and operational efficiencies. 
 
 We consider our consumer loans to be nonperforming at 90 days contractually past due, at which point we stop accruing finance charges and reverse finance charges previously accrue d .

 ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES 
 
 We estimate and record an allowance for finance receivable losses to cover the expected lifetime credit losses on our finance receivables. Our allowance for finance receivable losses may fluctuate based upon changes in portfolio growth, credit quality, and economic conditions. 
 
 Our methodology to estimate expected credit losses uses recent macroeconomic forecasts, which include forecasts for unemployment. We leverage projections from various industry leading providers. We also consider inflationary pressures, consumer confidence levels, and interest rate increases that may continue to impact the economic outlook. At September 30, 2024, our economic forecast used a reasonable and supportable period of 12 months. We may experience further changes to the macroeconomic assumptions within our forecast, as well as changes to our loan loss performance outlook, both of which could lead to further changes in our allowance for finance receivable losses, allowance ratio, and provision for finance receivable losses. 
 
 Changes in our allowance for finance receivable losses were as follows:

 (b) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2022-02, we recorded a one-time adjustment to the allowance for finance receivable losses. See Notes 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 included in our Annual Report for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2022-02. 
 
 The current delinquency status of our finance receivable portfolio, inclusive of recent borrower performance and loss performance, volume of our modified finance receivable activity, level and recoverability of collateral securing our finance receivable portfolio, and the reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions are the primary drivers that can cause fluctuations in our allowance ratio from period to period. We monitor the allowance ratio to ensure we have a sufficient level of allowance for finance receivable losses based on the estimated lifetime expected credit losses in our finance receivable portfolio. The allowance for finance receivable losses as a percentage of net finance receivables decreased from the prior year period primarily due to change in the portfolio mix. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about the changes in the allowance for finance receivable losses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS 
 
 We finance the majority of our operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations, secured debt, unsecured debt, borrowings from revolving conduit facilities and credit card revolving VFN facilities, whole loan sales, and equity. We may also utilize other sources in the future. As a holding company, all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries primary cash needs relate to funding our lending activities, our debt service obligations, our operating expenses, payment of insurance claims, and supporting strategic initiatives. 
 
 We have previously purchased portions of our unsecured indebtedness, and we may elect to purchase additional portions of our unsecured indebtedness or securitized borrowings in the future. Future purchases may be made through the open market, privately negotiated transactions with third parties, or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers, all of which are subject to terms, prices, and consideration we may determine at our discretion. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, OMH generated net income of 383 million. OMH s net cash outflow from operating and investing activities totaled 291 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, our scheduled interest payments for 2024 totaled 66 million and there were no scheduled principal payments for 2024 on our existing unsecured debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 9.0 billion of unencumbered receivables. 
 
 Based on our estimates and considering the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due. 
 
 OMFC s Issuances, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Unsecured Debt 
 
 On May 22, 2024, OMFC issued a total of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500 Senior Notes due 2031 under the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee on an unsecured basis. 
 
 On June 10, 2024, OMFC paid a net aggregate amount of 1.0 billion, inclusive of accrued interest and premium, to complete the redemption of its 6.875 Senior Notes due 2025. 
 
 On August 19, 2024, OMFC issued a Social Bond offering for a total of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125 Senior Notes due 2031 under the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee on an unsecured basis. OMFC intends to allocate an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from the offering to finance or refinance, in part or in full, a portfolio of new or existing loans that meet the eligibility criteria of OneMain Financial s Social Bond Framework. 
 
 From time to time we may purchase portions of our unsecured indebtedness through the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 267 million of our unsecured notes. 
 
 OMFC s Unsecured Corporate Revolver 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the borrowing capacity of our corporate revolver was 1.1 billion. 
 
 Securitizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities and Credit Card Revolving VFN Facilities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed one new consumer loan securitization (OMFIT 2024-1, see Securitized Borrowings below) and redeemed one consumer loan securitization (FCRT 2021-1, see Securitized Borrowings below). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into three new revolving conduit facilities. At September 30, 2024, 176 million was drawn under our revolving conduit facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity was 6.7 billion. At September 30, 2024, we had 13.8 billion of consumer loan gross finance receivables pledged as collateral for our securitizations, revolving conduit facilities, and private secured term funding.

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into two credit card revolving VFN facilities. At September 30, 2024, the maximum capacity of our credit card revolving VFN facilities was 300 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 227 million of credit card principal balances held in OMFCT for our credit card revolving VFN facilities. 
 
 Private Secured Term Funding 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the maximum borrowing capacity of 350 million was outstanding under the private secured term funding collateralized by our consumer loans. No principal payments are required to be made until after April 25, 2025, followed by a subsequent one-year amortization period, which upon expiration the outstanding principal is due and payable. 
 
 See Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information on our long-term debt, securitization transactions, private secured term funding, revolving conduit facilities, and credit card revolving VFN facilities. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 
 Our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings, and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. 
 
 The table below outlines OMFC s long-term corporate debt ratings and outlook by rating agencies:

 While OMH intends to pay its minimum quarterly dividend, currently 1.04 per share, for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. OMH s dividend payments may change from time to time, and the Board may choose not to continue to declare dividends in the future. See our Dividend Policy in Part II - Item 5 included in our Annual Report for further information. 
 
 Whole Loan Sale Transactions 
 
 We have whole loan sale flow agreements with third parties, with current terms of less than one year, in which we agreed to sell a remaining total of 330 million gross receivables of newly originated unsecured personal loans along with any associated accrued interest.

 Liquidity Risks and Strategies 
 
 OMFC s credit ratings are non-investment grade, which has a significant impact on our cost and access to capital. This, in turn, can negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity and our ability or cost to refinance our indebtedness. There are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, capital raising, and debt refinancing plans, some of which may not be quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks are further described in our Liquidity and Capital Resources of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7 included in our Annual Report. 
 
 The principal factors that could decrease our liquidity are customer delinquencies and defaults, a decline in customer prepayments, rising interest rates, and a prolonged inability to adequately access capital market funding. We intend to support our liquidity position by utilizing strategies that are further described in our Liquidity and Capital Resources of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7 included in our Annual Report. However, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of our significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect. 
 
 OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, AHL and Triton paid extraordinary dividends to OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC OMFH of 70 million and 30 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, AHL and Triton paid ordinary dividends to OMFH of 98 million and 58 million, respectively, and paid extraordinary dividends to OMFH of 67 million and 2 million, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 included in our Annual Report for further information on these state restrictions and the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries in 2023.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 included in our Annual Report. We consider the allowance for finance receivable losses to be a critical accounting policy because it involves critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or to our methodologies for deriving critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Seasonality 
 
 Our consumer loan volume and demand are generally lowest during the first part of the year following the holiday season and as a result of tax refunds, and then increases through the end of the year. Delinquencies follow the same trends, being generally lower during the first part of the year and rising throughout the remainder of the year. These seasonal trends contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs throughout the year.
