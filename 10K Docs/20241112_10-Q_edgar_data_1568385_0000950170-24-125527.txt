 business units of Big Village (Big Village Insights, Inc., and Big Village Agency LLC (together, referred to as the "Big Village Entities")), in an all-cash transaction funded by the Centre Lane senior secured credit facility (the "Big Village Acquisition"). Digital Publishing Our digital publishing division focuses on developing content that attracts an audience and monetizes that audience through advertising. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families, and more broadly, women. The portfolio consists of popular websites including Mom.com, Cafemom.com, LittleThings.com, and MamasLatinas.com. This demographic is highly sought after by brands and their advertising agencies. We use internal and external technologies to constantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the content we create. Our publishing division monetizes its audiences through both direct and programmatic advertising sales. Advertising Technology Our advertising technology division focuses on delivering targeted ads to audiences on owned and operated sites as well as third-party publishers in a cost-effective manner through the deployment of proprietary technologies. By developing our own proprietary technology stack, we are able to pass along efficiencies to both the demand and supply side of the ecosystem. Our goal is to enable and support a streamlined, end-to-end advertising model that addresses both demand (buy side) and publisher supply (sell side) programmatic sales and delivery of digital advertisements using an array of audience targeting tools and advertising formats (display, audio, video, CTV, and in-app). Programmatic advertising relies on software programs that leverage data and proprietary algorithms to match the optimal selection of an ad with a bid price offered by advertisers. Consumer Insights Our consumer insights division focuses on providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insight to address customers' strategic issues. We provide cutting-edge and dynamic research, offering clients a comprehensive perspective on their consumers. This insight extends to strategic guidance on the optimal timing and channels to effectively connect with target audiences. Our cutting-edge approach combines advanced data analytics and comprehensive market research, to uncover actionable insights that drive informed decision-making. Creative Services Our creative services division transforms data into award-winning campaigns. We are uniquely able to leverage insights teams with highly strategic media planning and buying teams to ensure brands not only position their advertising precisely, but also yield impactful business results. Our goal is to combine data-driven decisions with creativity fueled by a deep understanding of modern culture. Media Services Our media services division focuses on advertisers and agencies by providing access to premium inventory, leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns. Our aim is to empower clients to access the most sought-after advertising spaces across diverse platforms tailored to their specific needs and preferences. Our data-driven approach ensures that ad placements are not only well-targeted, but also continuously optimized for maximum efficiency and return on investment. Our commitment to combining premium inventory access with data-driven programmatic campaign optimization makes us an indispensable partner in the success of our clients' advertising and marketing endeavors.

million as of September 30, 2024. Cash flows used in operating activities were and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately a million working capital deficit, inclusive of million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its liquidity needs through a combination of factors. The Company is currently exploring several strategic alternatives, including restructuring, or refinancing its debt, or seeking additional debt, including borrowing under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Agreement, or raising equity capital. The ability to access the capital markets depends, in part, upon the volume and market price of the Company's stock, which cannot be assured. Other measures include reducing or delaying certain business activities, and reducing general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount. The ultimate success of these plans is not guaranteed. The Company's current cash and working capital, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is not expected to be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations over the next twelve months. As a result, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations and continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and if triggering events are noted prior to the annual assessment. Impairment is deemed to occur when the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit exceeds the implied value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2023, an impairment assessment was performed on goodwill for the Ad Network, Owned Operating and Insights reporting units. The assessment used a qualitative assessment which includes consideration of the economic, industry and market conditions in addition to the overall financial performance of the Company and these assets. Our qualitative assessment concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the Ad Network and Owned Operating reporting units was less than the carrying value, hence, we performed a quantitative analysis. Our assessment for the Insights reporting unit did not have such a conclusion, hence a quantitative analysis was not required. In a quantitative test, the fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis and further analyzed using other methods of valuation. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our long-term projections. Assumptions used in our impairment testing are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. Our discount rate is based on a market participant debt structure and cost of capital. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge of the reporting unit s goodwill would be necessary. At December 31, 2023 , our quantitative analysis showed that the implied fair value of our goodwill for the Ad Network and Owned Operating reporting units was less than its carrying value which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million. There was triggering event or impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Goodwill and Intangibles Assets Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, and if triggering events are noted prior to the annual assessment. Impairment is deemed to occur when the carrying value associated with the reporting unit exceeds the implied value associated with the reporting unit. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flow method), which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility The Company is required to perform an analysis of the change in each amendment to determine whether the change is a modification or an extinguishment of debt. Under a modification, no gain or loss is recorded, and a new effective interest rate is established based on the carrying value of the debt and revised cash flow. If the debt is extinguished, the old debt is derecognized and the new debt is recorded as fair value, which becomes the new carrying value. Amendment seventeen was considered an extinguishment. The Company utilized a third party valuation company to calculate the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the amendment and determined that it was substantially different by at least from the present value of the remaining cash flow of the original debt instrument.

Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC. 
 Business Overview 
 Organization and Nature of Operations 
 Bright Mountain Media, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company, Bright Mountain or we has an end-to-end digital media and advertising services platform that efficiently connects brands with targeted consumer demographics. We focus on digital publishing, advertising technology, consumer insights, creative and media services. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two business units of Big Village (Big Village Insights, Inc., and Big Village Agency LLC (together, referred to as the "Big Village Entities")), in an all-cash transaction funded by the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility (the "Big Village Acquisition"). 
 Digital Publishing 
 Our digital publishing division focuses on developing content that attracts an audience and monetizes that audience through advertising. The current portfolio of owned and operated websites is focused on moms, parenting, families, and more broadly, women. The portfolio consists of popular websites including Mom.com, Cafemom.com, LittleThings.com, and MamasLatinas.com. This demographic is highly sought after by brands and their advertising agencies. We use internal and external technologies to constantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the content we create. Our publishing division monetizes its audiences through both direct and programmatic advertising sales. 
 Advertising Technology 
 Our advertising technology division focuses on delivering targeted ads to audiences on owned and operated sites as well as third-party publishers in a cost-effective manner through the deployment of proprietary technologies. By developing our own proprietary technology stack, we are able to pass along efficiencies to both the demand and supply side of the ecosystem. Our goal is to enable and support a streamlined, end-to-end advertising model that addresses both demand (buy side) and publisher supply (sell side) programmatic sales and delivery of digital advertisements using an array of audience targeting tools and advertising formats (display, audio, video, CTV, and in-app). Programmatic advertising relies on software programs that leverage data and proprietary algorithms to match the optimal selection of an ad with a bid price offered by advertisers. 
 Consumer Insights 
 Our consumer insights division focuses on providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insight to address customers' strategic issues. We provide cutting-edge and dynamic research, offering clients a comprehensive perspective on their consumers. This insight extends to strategic guidance on the optimal timing and channels to effectively connect with target audiences. Our cutting-edge approach combines advanced data analytics and comprehensive market research, to uncover actionable insights that drive informed decision-making. 
 Creative Services 
 Our creative services division transforms data into award-winning campaigns. We are uniquely able to leverage insights teams with highly strategic media planning and buying teams to ensure brands not only position their advertising precisely, but also yield impactful business results. Our goal is to combine data-driven decisions with creativity fueled by a deep understanding of modern culture.

Media Services 
 Our media services division focuses on advertisers and agencies by providing access to premium inventory, leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns. Our aim is to empower clients to access the most sought-after advertising spaces across diverse platforms tailored to their specific needs and preferences. Our data-driven approach ensures that ad placements are not only well-targeted, but also continuously optimized for maximum efficiency and return on investment. Our commitment to combining premium inventory access with data-driven programmatic campaign optimization makes us an indispensable partner in the success of our clients' advertising and marketing endeavors. 
 The Company generates revenue through: 
 the selling of advertisements placed on our owned and managed sites and on partner websites where we earn a share of the revenue; 

facilitating the seamless, real-time exchange of advertisements on a large scale, bridging networks of buyers (referred to as "DSPs") and networks of sellers (referred to as "SSPs"); 

serving advertisers through providing access to premium resources and leveraging data to optimize programmatic campaigns, where revenue is derived from the planning and execution of creative and media marketing campaigns; and 

providing primary and secondary research, competitive intelligence, and expert insights to address customers' strategic issues, where revenue is primarily derived from providing a single integrated service for such research. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Seasonal Fluctuations . Typically advertising technology companies report a material portion of their revenues during the third and fourth calendar quarter as a result of back-to-school and holiday-related advertising spend. We continue to experience this trend in our advertising technology division. Because of seasonal fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the results of any quarter or full year will be indicative of results for future years or quarters. 
 Limited Number of Customers . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one customer represented 13.4 and 13.5 of revenue, respectively. 
 Managing Industry Dynamics . We operate in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry. Advances in programmatic advertising technologies, and the efficient and automated method of purchasing ads online, has enabled publishers to auction their ad inventory to more buyers simultaneously, in real time. As advertisers stay ahead of evolving trends in consumer engagement with digital media, an expansive opportunity for innovation emerges. Our commitment to understanding customer needs empowers us, and our continuous pursuit of innovation enables swift adaptation to industry shifts. This approach not only facilitates the development of cutting-edge solutions, but also does so in a cost-effective manner. 
 As regulatory concerns accelerate the impact on existing industry standards, companies are actively seeking new methods to finely tailor their messages to target audiences. Tech companies will be limited in how they monetize personal information for advertising purposes. This trend is exemplified by two imminent developments: (1) the anticipated erosion of Google's third-party cookies and (2) the data security measures integrated into Apple iPhone. Consequently, companies must explore innovative methods to better understand their target audiences and have the tools to effectively engage with them.

General and administrative expenses increased by 43,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to a combination of factors as discussed below: 
 Personnel Cost 
 Personnel cost increased by 734,000, or 12 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Company reduced its head count by 47 employees, including 22 employees that were terminated as a reduction in force. The Company incurred severance cost of approximately 93,000 in connection with this reduction. The Company incurred severance cost of approximately 322,000 associated with a head count reduction during the same period for 2023. 
 Professional Fees 
 Professional fees decreased by 530,000 or 18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 685,000 of professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represented costs associated with the Big Village Acquisition. 
 Data Processing 
 Data processing increased by 550,000, or 130 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. As discussed above, the Big Village Acquisition was completed in April 2023, and contributed to data processing for six months of the prior period and for the full nine months of the current period, and is the main driver of the increase in data processing for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets. The assessment indicated that the carrying value was in excess of its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of 13.7 million and 2.5 million for goodwill and intangibles, respectively. There was no impairment recorded for the same period of 2024.

Financing and other expense, net increased by 3.4 million, or 59 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period during 2023. This increase was largely attributable to 3.4 million or 55 , increase in interest expense related to the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility which reflected higher principal and fees due to the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility amendments during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements and for use within management's discussion and analysis based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company's financial performance, but non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 All of the items included in the reconciliation from net loss before taxes to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, etc.) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance (e.g., M A costs, income taxes, gain on sale of investments, loss on disposal of assets, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the Company's operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business. 
 We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. 
 Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company's performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. 
 A reconciliation of net loss before taxes to non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. The following table summarizes total current assets, total current liabilities, and net working capital (deficit) as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.

(11,065) 

As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 2.5 million compared with a cash balance of 4.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company s liquidity needs, and a discussion of how it intends to meet those needs, is discussed below. See Going Concern. 
 Going Concern 
 Historically, the Company has incurred losses, which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately 163.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash flows used in operating activities were 451,000 and 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately 13.0 million, inclusive of 2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Company's current cash and working capital, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is not expected to be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations over the next twelve months. As a result, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations and continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its liquidity needs through a combination of factors. During the next year, we anticipate that we will need approximately 6.3 million to meet our contractual obligations in addition to amounts needed for our working capital needs. The Company is currently exploring several strategic alternatives, including restructuring, or refinancing its debt, or seeking additional debt, including borrowing under the Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Agreement, or raising equity capital. The ability to access the capital markets depends, in part, upon the volume and market price of the Company's stock, which cannot be assured. Other measures include reducing or delaying certain business activities, and reducing general and administrative expenses, including a reduction in headcount. The ultimate success of these plans is not guaranteed. 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Financing Arrangement Summary 
 Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 On June 5, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement between themselves, the lenders party thereto and Centre Lane Partners Master Credit Fund II, L.P., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent Centre Lane Partners ), as amended (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement has been amended numerous times to change the terms, including the amounts outstanding, the interest rate, the maturity date and other payment terms. 
 The outstanding principal owed to Centre Lane Partners was 77.0 million and 70.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and matures on April 20, 2026. Of the amount outstanding at September 30, 2024, approximately 1.3 million is due by December 31, 2024 with 2.9 million due by September 30, 2025. The balance of 72.9 million is due in 2026. 
 The amount due under the Credit Agreement bears interest at 7.0 per annum plus the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). At September 30, 2024, the SOFR was 5.30 , thus the overall interest rate on this facility was 12.33 per annum at September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with the Twentieth Amendment, adjustments were made to the interest rate for outstanding loans as follows: 
 Changing the last out term loan PIK rate to the SOFR plus 7 until December 31, 2024, and to the SOFR plus 2 (previously 5 thereafter;

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. 
 Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, allowance for current expected credit losses, the determination of the relative selling prices of our services, percentage of completion for revenue recognition, estimates of amortization period for intangible assets, estimates of depreciation period for property and equipment, discount rates used in the valuation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, litigation reserves, the valuation of equity-based transactions, valuation of the Center Lane Senior Secured Facility carrying value regarding debt modification or extinguishment, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
 Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or otherwise complex. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recent accounting pronouncements are detailed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even though we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include information otherwise required by this Item 3 to Form 10-Q. 
 Item 4. Controls and Pro cedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer (its principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (its principal financial officer), have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, senior management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). 
 As the Company integrates the operations acquired through the Big Village Acquisition, there is a risk of identifying deficiencies in our overall internal controls. Our focus is on implementing and maintaining effective financial management systems and internal controls, on an ongoing process. However, given that all such controls are not yet fully operational, management has concluded that a material weakness existed in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, rendering them ineffective at December 31, 2023. 
 As set forth below, management will take steps to remediate the material weaknesses identified below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below, we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Outlined below are the material weaknesses identified by management, along with the remedial actions planned. 
 Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2023, management identified certain material weaknesses. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

As the Company continues to integrate the operations assumed as part of the Big Village Acquisition, we have identified deficiencies in our overall internal controls, specifically as identified below: 
 Inadequate controls related to revenue recognition, cost of revenue, and the accounts payable and accrual process leading to potential omission or misstatement of material transactions impacting financial statements; and 

Ineffectiveness of the Company s information technology systems and controls concerning financial information. 

To address these weaknesses, the Company has initiated a remediation plan comprising the following measures: 
 Updating the information technology general controls ("ITGC") risk assessment to incorporate operations from the Big Village Acquisition; 

Examination of information technology systems to ascertain necessary updates to support the financial reporting process; 

Collaboration with a third-party company to ensure SOX compliance, establish and document controls related to revenue recognition, accounts payable, and other processes to enhance internal controls over financial reporting; and 

Expansion of our finance department through the hiring of certified public accountants with prior auditing experience, knowledge of SEC filings and technical issues. In the year ended December 31, 2023, two additional certified public accountants were onboarded, tasked with month end close oversights and SEC reporting. We believe this will strengthen our finance department as we work towards developing strong internal controls and providing guidance beyond the finance functions to senior management to support our financial reporting process. 

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the matters set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
