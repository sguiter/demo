SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 
 CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can find many (but not all) of these statements by looking for words such as approximates, believes, hopes, expects, anticipates, estimates, projects, intends, plans, would, should, could, may or other similar expressions in this Form 10-Q. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; prospective products, applications, customers and technologies; future performance or results of anticipated products; anticipated expenses; and projected financial results. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 our history of losses; 
 our ability to achieve profitability; 
 the risk that we have a limited operating history, have not yet manufactured any non-prototype aircraft or delivered any aircraft to a customer, and we and our current and future collaborators may be unable to successfully develop and market our aircraft or solutions, or may experience significant delays in doing so; 
 the ability to meet the development and commercialization schedule with respect to the TriFan 600; 
 our ability to secure required certifications for the TriFan 600 and/or any other aircraft we develop; 
 our ability to navigate the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; 
 the risk that our conditional pre-orders (which include conditional aircraft purchase agreements, non-binding reservations, and options) are canceled, modified, delayed or not placed and that we must return the refundable deposits; 
 our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future as needed; 
 our ability to continue as a going concern; 
 emerging competition and rapidly advancing technologies in our industries that may outpace our technology; 
 the risk that other aircraft manufacturers develop competitive VTOL aircraft or other competitive aircraft that adversely affect our market position; 
 customer demand for the products and services we develop; 
 our ability to develop other new products and technologies; 
 our ability to attract customers and/or fulfill customer orders; 
 our ability to enhance and maintain the reputation of our brand and expand our customer base; 
 our ability to scale in a cost-effective manner and maintain and expand our manufacturing and supply chain relationships; 
 our ability to attract, integrate, manage, and retain qualified personnel or key employees; 
 ii 

Table of Contents 

our ability to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market; 
 the risks relating to long development and sales cycles, our ability to satisfy the conditions and deliver on the orders and reservations, our ability to maintain quality control of our aircraft, and our dependence on third parties for supplying components and potentially manufacturing the aircraft; 
 the risk that our ability to sell our aircraft may be limited by circumstances beyond our control, such as a shortage of pilots and mechanics who meet the training standards, high maintenance frequencies and costs for the sold aircraft, and any accidents or incidents involving VTOL aircraft that may harm customer confidence; 
 general economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our potential customers, including, but not limited to increases in inflation rates and rates of interest, supply chain challenges, increased costs for materials and labor, cybersecurity attacks, other lingering impacts resulting from COVID-19, and the Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Hamas conflicts; 
 lawsuits and other claims by third parties or investigations by various regulatory agencies that we may be subjected to and are required to report, including but not limited to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); 
 our ability to respond to a failure of our systems and technology to operate our business; 
 the risk that our future patent applications may not be approved or may take longer than expected, and that we may incur substantial costs in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property; 
 the outcome of any known and unknown litigation and regulatory proceedings; 
 impact of any changes in existing or future tax regimes; 
 our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and 
 other factors discussed in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Form 10-Q, particularly in the Risk Factors section, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make or collaborations or strategic partnerships we may enter into. 
 
 You should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to this Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 million, and cash of approximately million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately million of cash for operating activities. 
 There can be no assurances that the Company will ever earn revenues sufficient to support its operations, or that it will ever be profitable. In order to continue its operations, the Company has supplemented the revenues it earned with proceeds from the sale of its equity and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. 
 The Company's recurring losses and utilization of cash in its operations are indicators of going concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. Management s plans and assessment of the probability that such plans will mitigate and alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and attain further operating efficiency, which is uncertain, which together represent the principal conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 to years, which approximates customer attrition rate and technology obsolescence. 
 The Company tests goodwill for potential impairment at least annually as of October 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired . Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and the Company recognizes an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. 
 Based on its assessments, the Company does not believe it has a goodwill impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined of its long-lived assets were impaired.

Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 

Overview of Our Business 
 
 Following the closing of the XTI Merger, we are primarily an aircraft development company. We also provide real-time location systems RTLS for the industrial sector, which was our primary focus prior to the closing of the XTI Merger. Headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, XTI Aerospace is developing a vertical takeoff and landing ("VTOL") aircraft that is designed to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like a fixed-wing business aircraft. We believe our initial configuration, the TriFan 600, will be one of the first civilian fixed-wing VTOL aircraft that offers the speed, range and comfort of a business aircraft and the versatility of a helicopter for a wide range of customer applications, including private aviation for business and high net worth individuals, emergency medical services, and commuter and regional air travel. Since 2013, we have been engaged primarily in developing the design and engineering concepts for the TriFan 600, building and testing a two-thirds scale unmanned version of the TriFan 600, generating pre-orders for the TriFan 600, and seeking funds from investors to enable the Company to build full-scale piloted prototypes of the TriFan 600, and to eventually engage in commercial production and sale of the TriFan 600 aircraft. 
 
 Our RTLS solution leverages cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics to provide real-time tracking and monitoring of assets, machines, and people within industrial environments. With our RTLS, businesses can achieve improved operational efficiency, enhanced safety and reduced costs. By having real-time visibility into operations, industrial organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions, minimize downtime, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. 
 
 We report financial results for two segments: Commercial Aviation and Industrial IoT. For Industrial IoT, we generate revenue from sales of hardware, software licenses and professional services. For Commercial Aviation, the segment is pre-revenue as we are currently developing the TriFan 600 aircraft. 

Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 
 We believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to retain and develop engineering internal and third-party resources, secure strategic partnerships with suppliers, expand the number of customer purchase orders, locate a facility for further aircraft development and testing, expand on that facility or locate to a new facility for commercial production, build-out production assembly lines in a timely manner, develop ancillary service offerings related to the TriFan 600 such as flight training and maintenance products, and secure the needed financing to achieve Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") certification. 
 
 While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose material challenges and risks that we must successfully address to achieve FAA certification of the TriFan 600 and further reach our current aircraft delivery forecasts.

 Corporate Strategy Update 
 
 Commercial Aviation 
 
 We intend to continue our development of the TriFan 600 by engaging key supply partners, establishing vendors of key components of the full-scale Test Aircraft #1, commissioning and completing trade studies, and completing the development design review of the TriFan 600. We will need additional capital to complete our development of the series of Test Aircraft and beyond and are pursuing multiple alternatives for such funding. 
 
 We will continue to develop an internal and external sales and marketing capability to increase awareness of the aircraft and position the Company to continue taking customer orders and deposits. We believe that increasing awareness of the aircraft and demonstrating customer demand through sales orders will enhance the Company s ability to continue raising capital in the future. 
 
 We do not believe we will be able to generate revenues in this commercial aviation segment without successfully completing the certification of the proposed TriFan 600 aircraft. 
 
 Industrial IoT 
 
 Since 2019 and post acquisition, Legacy Inpixon's operations have been focused on building and developing our Indoor Intelligence TM platform to be able to offer a comprehensive range of solutions that allow for the collection of data within workplace environments to delivering insights from that data for, people, places and things. We believe we have positioned the Industrial IoT business as a market leader with a comprehensive suite of products and solutions allowing us to help organizations enhance the visitor and employee experience with actionable indoor intelligence making them smarter, safer and more secure. We operate and compete in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological innovation, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products, product enhancements, services and distribution methods. Our success will depend on our ability to develop expertise with these new products, product enhancements, services and distribution methods and to implement solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid changes in technology, the industry, and customer needs. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Commercial Aviation 
 
 We plan to seek FAA certification of the TriFan 600 as a fixed-wing, VTOL aircraft. Initial concept and engineering analysis for the TriFan 600 was completed in July 2015. Legacy XTI built a 65 scale prototype and in May 2019 began initial hover tests. The prototype was successfully hover-tested multiple times. Subsequent to raising private funding during 2021, Legacy XTI hired a number of engineers (employees and consultants) to establish its core engineering organization. Additionally, Legacy XTI retained consulting firms to provide specialized engineering technical knowledge to complement XTI s team. 
 
 Legacy XTI completed its preliminary design review PDR in 2022, which set the stage for the next step of design development. Legacy XTI updated the exterior design of the TriFan 600, including the location of the wing fans and the location of the horizontal tail, all of which had a positive impact on the performance and efficiency of the aircraft. Design and engineering for other systems, including the propulsion system, landing gear, cockpit visibility, cabin sizing and structural integrity were also advanced during 2022 and 2023. 
 
 The XTI team is currently working toward an update to the initial PDR to address additional aerodynamic and performance improvements. In addition, the program includes further interactions with potential suppliers for the development of major structures and systems of the aircraft. The team is focused on industry-respected suppliers and systems for the TriFan 600 to reduce certification risk and to deliver a fully-integrated aircraft. Also, during this phase XTI will formally establish a project plan with the FAA and apply for Type Certification (TC). 
 
 The next target milestones include the critical design review CDR and building and preliminary testing of a full-scale flight test aircraft, along with building additional full-scale flight test aircraft, are fully dependent on raising additional financing.

 Industrial IoT 
 
 Our management believes that we must continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts to maintain a competitive position. Our RTLS products intersect many emerging fields including metaverse, augmented reality, occupancy planning, industry 4.0, smart cities, and more, and we continue to innovate and patent new methods to solve problems for our customers. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Commercial Aviation 
 
 The business aircraft market is highly competitive and we face a significant number of original equipment manufacturer competitors, most of which are larger, better known and have better financial resources than us. When the TriFan 600 goes into production, we believe it will compete with other aircraft manufacturers by providing our customers with what we believe is a unique crossover aircraft with distinct and largely unique performance capabilities at a competitive purchase price. We believe the TriFan 600 will be one of a small number of aircraft that offers the speed, range and comfort of a business aircraft with the versatility of VTOL. As we expect that the TriFan 600 will be capable of flying greater distances and on average at twice the speed and three times the range of competing helicopters, we expect the TriFan 600 to offer lower direct operating costs (cost per flight hour) and be able to fly almost twice as many missions, thus generating additional cost savings and revenue for airlines and aircraft operators when compared with helicopters . 
 
 Industrial IoT 
 
 In addition, our Industrial IoT business is characterized by innovation and rapid change. Our RTLS Indoor Intelligence products compete with companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Juniper Networks/Mist Systems, Ubisense, Sewio, Kinexon, Zebra Technologies and other mostly vertical focused RTLS companies. Some competitors determine positioning primarily using BLE or Wi-Fi and, therefore, we believe they cannot achieve the same accuracy that we do and so cannot meet some customers' needs. Many RTLS competitors are focused on one technology and/or vertical and, at this time, we believe none of them have as complete an offering of tags, anchors, positioning, engine, software, integrations and analytics. We believe we offer a unique and differentiated approach to the market with our Industrial IoT business which is comprehensive, scalable, and technology-agnostic. 

Recent Events 
 The Company completed its merger with Legacy XTI on March 12, 2024, which was structured as a reverse triangular merger. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements 
 On July 9, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days beginning on May 23, 2024, and ending on July 8, 2024, the Company no longer meets the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2025, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company received another letter (the "Low Price Deficiency Letter") from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, as of November 6, 2024, the Company s common stock had a closing bid price of 0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the "Low Priced Stocks Rule"). As a result, Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market (the "Determination"), unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination on or prior to November 14, 2024, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. 
 The Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel") to appeal the Determination and to address compliance with the Low Priced Stocks Rule. The Low Price Deficiency Letter states that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. The Company will be asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance, which plan the Company is in the process of preparing. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 The Low Price Deficiency Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq and its common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "XTIA." While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of the Company s common stock would be stayed and the Company s common stock would continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in its appeal to the Panel or be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. 
 Employment Agreement with Chief Strategy Officer 
 The Company entered into an employment agreement with Tobin Arthur on September 19, 2024, effective as of such date (the "Arthur Employment Agreement"), pursuant to which Mr. Arthur agreed to serve as the Company s Chief Strategy Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the Arthur Employment Agreement, Mr. Arthur is entitled to receive an annual base salary of 300,000, which may be increased by the Board from time to time in its sole discretion.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing. Historically changes in management estimates have not been material. 
 There have been no significant changes to Legacy Inpixon's critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the addition of Legacy XTI's critical accounting policies and estimates which have been incorporated and disclosed in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financials statements included elsewhere in this report and the valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill as noted below. 
 Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill. 
 
 We periodically review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, or more often if there are indications of possible impairment. 
 
 The analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts, including estimated future cash flows, estimates of long-term growth rates for our business, the expected life over which cash flows will be realized and assumed royalty and discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge. While the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on our current estimates and assumptions, materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions, changes in our business or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses. 
 
 For assets to be held and used, including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Significant management judgment is required in this process. 
 
 For intangible assets not subject to amortization such as goodwill, we test for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair value with the carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using inputs and assumptions such as revenue growth rates, projected research and development expenditures based on future milestones of the TriFan 600 aircraft development, other projected expenses, and discount rates. If we were to experience a decrease in forecasted future revenues attributable to the intangible assets, this could indicate a potential impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired, and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of goodwill. 
 
 We will perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by ASC 350 as of October 1st of each year. In testing goodwill for impairment, we analyze qualitative factors as stated within ASC 350 to determine if the fair value of our single reporting unit may be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have one reporting unit (Industrial IoT). If the fair value of the reporting unit, based on qualitative factors, may be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we then perform the goodwill impairment test required under ASC 350 by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Accordingly, we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of such excess. 
 
 In the Merger we recorded approximately 12.4 million in goodwill which allocated to our Industrial IOT reporting unit. Since the closing date of the Merger on March 12, 2024, the price of our common stock has declined significantly and may continue to fluctuate in future periods. A sustained decrease in the price of our common stock is one of the qualitative factors to be considered as part of an impairment test when evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances may indicate that it is more likely than not that a potential goodwill impairment exists. We will continue monitoring the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative factors used as a basis for the goodwill impairment test during fiscal year 2024 and at the Company s October 1st 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 annual testing date. As of September 30, 2024, Management evaluated potential triggers and completed a qualitative assessment and determined in the aggregate, it is not more likely than not, that the fair value of the Goodwill is less than its carrying value. To corroborate this conclusion, we entered into an agreement for a proposed equity investment at a post-money valuation in line with the fairness opinion obtained in July 2023 and compared our equity carrying value to our market capitalization and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. If the negative volatility of our market capitalization is sustained, it is possible that our goodwill could become impaired, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Commercial Aviation 
 
 We are still working to design, develop and certify the TriFan 600 aircraft and thus have not generated revenue from this segment. We do not expect to begin generating significant revenues until we are able to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing of the aircraft. 
 
 Industrial IoT 
 
 Our RTLS products are primarily sold on a license and SaaS mode, which we call "location as a service" or "LaaS." In our licensing model, we also typically charge an annual maintenance fee. The LaaS model is typically for a 3-5 year contract and includes a license to use, maintenance and hardware upgrades. The LaaS model generates a recurring revenue stream. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development activities represent a significant part of our business. Our research and development efforts focus on the design and development of (i) our indoor intelligence products, and (ii) our TriFan 600 aircraft, including certain of the systems that will be used in it. As part of our aircraft development activities, we continue to work closely with the FAA towards our goal of achieving certification of our aircraft on an efficient timeline. 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of the TriFan 600 aircraft. These expenses include: 
 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits for personnel engaged in research and development functions; 
 
 expenses incurred under agreements with third parties such as consultants and contractors; and 
 
 software and technology-related expenses to support computer-aided design of the aircraft, flight simulations, and other technology needs of our engineers. 
 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we increase staffing to support aircraft engineering and software development, build aircraft prototypes and continue to explore and develop technologies. 
 
 We cannot determine with certainty the timing, duration or the costs necessary to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing of our TriFan 600 aircraft due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our research and development activities. Development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs may differ materially from expectations. 
 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Selling and marketing costs include activities such as aircraft reservation procurement, public relations and business opportunity advancement. These functions mainly generate expenses relating to travel, trade show fees and costs, salaries and benefits. Selling and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. 
 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, including non-capitalizable transaction costs; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs, facility related expenses including maintenance and allocated expenses for rent and other operating costs. 
 
 We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase substantially in the future as we increase our headcount to support continued research and development and commercialization of the TriFan 600. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Interest expense, net consists primarily of (i) interest relating to convertible and promissory notes payable, (ii) amortization of debt discounts relating to warrants and stock options issued in conjunction with convertible notes, and (iii) interest income on notes receivable. 
 
 Inducement loss on debt conversions includes primarily the inducement charges incurred by Legacy XTI when it entered into voluntary note conversion letter agreements with several note holders during the first quarter of 2024. Per the letter agreements, principal and accrued interest under the notes was converted at a reduced conversion price into shares of Legacy XTI common stock immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing time, which converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the XTI Merger. The Company accounted for these conversions as an inducement and, as such, recognized a loss related to the fair value of the additional shares issued compared to the original terms of the convertible notes. 
 
 Change in fair value of convertible notes represent the remeasurement of certain Legacy XTI convertible notes to fair value. These notes were converted to equity prior to the closing of XTI Merger. 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability represents the remeasurement of certain Legacy XTI and Legacy Inpixon outstanding warrants to fair value. These outstanding warrants were exchanged for common shares of the Company during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Other income (expense), net consists of miscellaneous income and expense items.

 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.9 million compared to 0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year for an increase of approximately 0.9 million. The revenue amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023. We expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 to remain consistent with the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million compared to 0.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The cost of revenues amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million compared to 0.0 million f or the comparable period in the prior year. The gross profit amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the results of the revenue-generating Industrial IoT segment, whereas the Company was pre-revenue in 2023. Revenue and gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 1.03 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The decline in gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of approximately 0.2 million was primarily driven by a decline in revenue and the recognition of a one-time inventory impairment charge of approximately 0.04 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We expect gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 to be similar to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.7 million and 2.4 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized one-time income of 2.3 million, which is included in general and administrative expenses, relating to the forfeiture of vested stock options previously granted to the former CEO of Legacy XTI. Excluding the income recognized from the aforementioned stock option forfeiture, operating expenses increased by approximately 4.7 million due primarily to (i) an increase in expenditures relating to the development of the TriFan 600 aircraft, (ii) an increase in consulting compensation mainly attributable to consulting arrangements entered into with prior executives of Legacy Inpixon on March 12, 2024, (iii) an increase in public company-related professional fees as the 2023 historical results reflect the operations of a private company, Legacy XTI, and (iv) the inclusion of the operating results of the Industrial IoT segment as of the closing of the XTI Merger. After excluding one-time items, we expect total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 to remain comparable to the third quarter. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 0.2 million compared to a loss of 0.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This fluctuation in other income (expense) of approximately 0.1 million was primarily attributable to a decline in interest expense as a result of Legacy XTI convertible notes being converted into equity immediately prior to the XTI Merger closing. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.

 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 28.3 million and 7.7 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. This increase of approximately 20.6 million was primarily attributable to (i) the recognition of 6.7 million of nonrecurring transaction bonus expense during the second quarter of 2024 as the bonuses became payable upon the earlier of the closing of qualifying financings or June 30, 2024, (ii) an increase in one-time merger-related transaction costs of 5.1 million, (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately 1.1 million , (iv) an increase in consulting compensation mainly attributable to consulting arrangements entered into with prior executives of Legacy Inpixon on March 12, 2024, (v) an increase in legal and accounting fees relating to capital raising activities during 2024, (vi) an increase in public company-related professional fees as the 2023 historical results reflect the operations of a

 private company, Legacy XTI, and (vii) the inclusion of the operating results of the Industrial IoT segment as of the XTI Merger closing date through the September 30, 2024 reporting date. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 5.3 million compared to a loss of 1.2 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. This fluctuation of approximately 6.5 million was primarily attributable to the Company recognizing an income gain of approximately 12.9 million relating to the remeasurement of convertible notes at fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by inducement losses on debt conversions of approximately 6.7 million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources as of September 30, 2024 
 Our current capital resources and operating results as of and through September 30, 2024, consist of: 
 1) an overall working capital deficit of approximately 11.9 million; 
 2) cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.5 million; 
 3) net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 14.3 million.

 legally binding. As of September 30, 2024, the total obligation for capitalized operating leases was approximately 0.5 million, of which approximately 0.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owed approximately 2.6 million relating to outstanding short-term promissory notes. This balance excludes intercompany amounts that are eliminated in the financial statements. These notes are payable within the next twelve months and the interest rate charged under the notes range from 4.0 to 18.6 . 
 Customer Deposits 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we received conditional pre-orders under a combination of non-binding aircraft purchase agreements, reservation deposit agreements, options and letters of intent for aircraft which generated approximately 1.4 million of cash from customer deposits. These funds from customer reservation deposits will not be recorded as revenue until the orders for aircraft are delivered, which may not be for many years or at all if we do not deliver the aircraft. The deposits prioritize orders when the aircraft becomes available for delivery. Customers making deposits are not obligated to purchase aircraft until they execute a definitive purchase agreement. Customers may request a return of their refundable deposit any time up until the execution of a purchase agreement. Customers request for a return of their refundable deposits could adversely affect our liquidity resources and we may be financially unable to return such deposits. 
 
 Financial Advisory Fees in connection with the XTI Merger 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of an amended advisory fees agreement among Legacy XTI, the Company and Maxim and in accordance with the XTI Merger Agreement, the Company issued 385,359 registered shares of XTI Aerospace common stock in exchange for shares of Legacy XTI common stock issued to Maxim based on the exchange ratio under the XTI Merger Agreement. Additionally, Maxim will receive 0.2 million payable upon the closing of one or more debt or equity financings for which Maxim serves as placement agent or underwriter and in which the Company raises minimum aggregate gross proceeds of 10 million following the Effective Time. 
 
 Legacy XTI Deferred Compensation and Retention Bonus Plan 
 
 In an effort to conserve cash, Legacy XTI implemented a cost savings plan, effective on July 1, 2022. As part of the cost savings plan, Legacy XTI installed a compensation reduction directive and retention bonus program impacting all employees and several current consultants. Accrued deferred compensation amounts under the cost savings plan will be repaid to participating individuals when executive management, at its sole discretion, determines that sufficient funding has been received by the Company, provided, in the case of employees, that such employees remain employed with the Company on such date. 
 
 As part of the plan, Legacy XTI granted participants a retention bonus, of either cash or equity, at the participant s discretion, equal in value to three months of their monthly deferred compensation amount, if cash, or six months of their monthly deferred compensation amount, if equity, if the employee remains with the Company at the earn date, which is defined as six months after the date on which the deferred compensation described above is repaid. 
 
 Upon receiving additional financing during the first quarter of 2023, Legacy XTI restored the salaries of all employees to the original salary amount, effective with the semi-monthly payroll ended March 31, 2023. 
 
 As of the date of this report, the Company has obligations of approximatel y 0.2 million and 0.2 million , respectively, relating to deferred compensation and retention bonuses under this plan. 
 Agreements with Prior "Legacy Inpixon" CEO 
 
 On March 12, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Nadir Ali (the Ali Consulting Agreement ), the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Ali, through a company of which he is a controlling member, currently holds shares of the Company's Series 9 Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Ali Consulting Agreement, following the closing of the XTI Merger, Mr. Ali will provide consulting services to the Company for 15 months ("Ali Consulting Period") or until earlier termination in accordance with its terms. During the Ali Consulting Period, the Company will pay him an aggregate of 0.3 million.

Each Equity Payment may be made, in Company s discretion, in (i) cash, (ii) fully vested shares of common stock under the Company s equity incentive plan, or a combination of cash and registered shares. As of the date of this report, the Company repaid the initial 1.5 million owed to Mr.

 Ali under the Ali Consulting Agreement. As of the date of this report, the Company owed Mr. Ali accrued consulting fees of approximately 1.0 million. 
 Consulting Arrangement with Prior "Legacy Inpixon" CFO 
 
 On March 12, 2024, the Company also entered into a Consulting Agreement with Ms. Wendy Loundermon (the Loundermon Consulting Agreement ), the Company's former Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to the Loundermon Consulting Agreement, following the Closing, Ms. Loundermon will provide consulting services to the Company for one year or until earlier termination in accordance with its terms (the Loundermon Consulting Period ). As compensation for Ms. Loundermon s consulting services, the Company will pay her (i) 83,333 per month for the first six months of the Loundermon Consulting Period for services she performs on an as-needed basis during the Loundermon Consulting Period regarding the transition of the management of the Company s financial reporting function to ensure continuity of business operations, and (ii) 300 per hour for services performed on an as needed basis regarding the preparation and filing of Company s public company financial reporting and compliance matters including accounting, payroll, audit and tax compliance functions. As of the date of this report, the Company owed Ms. Loundermon accrued consulting fees of approximately 0.5 million. 
 
 Transaction Bonus Plan 
 
 On July 24, 2023, the compensation committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee adopted a Transaction Bonus Plan, which was amended on March 11, 2024, and was intended to provide incentives to certain employees and other service providers to remain with the Company through the consummation of a qualifying transaction. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company accrued 100 or 6.7 million of the transaction bonuses, which is included in general and administrative within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, as the bonuses became payable upon the earlier of the closing of financing or June 30, 2024. As of the date of this report, the Company had an aggregate transaction bonus obligation outstanding of approximately 5.5 million. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately 11.9 million, and cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately 21.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately 14.3 million of cash for operating activities. 
 There can be no assurances that the Company will ever earn revenues sufficient to support its operations, or that it will ever be profitable. In order to continue its operations, the Company has historically supplemented the revenues it earned with proceeds from the sale of our equity, including through our ATM Offering with Maxim (as discussed below), and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. We believe that our current revenue, as supplemented by proceeds from our financings, will provide us with liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into the second quarter of 2025. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or significantly delay, defer or reduce our cash expenditures over the next two quarters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. 
 
 As discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of the Company s common stock under its ATM Offering through Maxim, as the Company s exclusive sales agent. Maxim is entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0 of the gross sales price per share sold excluding Maxim's costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of its legal counsel. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 3,190,727 shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement at per share prices between approximately 0.19 and 0.43, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately 1.0 million. 
 
 As of the date of this report, there was approximately 38.6 million in common stock gross sales remaining under the Equity Distribution Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth in the Series 9 ATM Consent, which, among other things, provides that the Company may not register shares under the ATM Offering in excess of 47.4 million (the "ATM Maximum Amount") without the prior written consent of the Required Holders (as defined below), and the Company may not issue or sell more than 6 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering (the "Initial Tranche") without the Required Holders prior written consent, which consent the Company is required to obtain for each additional 5 million in sales of common stock under the ATM Offering after the Initial Tranche up to the ATM Maximum Amount. "Required Holders" is defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock; provided that, pursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement dated as of March 12, 2024, between the Company and 3AM Investments LLC (an entity controlled by the Company's former director and former Chief Executive Officer, Nadir Ali) (the "Purchaser"), the Purchaser will be deemed a "Required Holder" as defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as long as the Purchaser holds any shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock.

The Company's recurring losses and utilization of cash in its operations are indicators of going concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. Management s plans and assessment of the probability that such plans will mitigate and alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and attain further operating efficiency, which is uncertain, which together represent the principal conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that any additional capital, whether in the form of equity or debt financing, will be sufficient or available and, if available, that such capital will be offered on terms and conditions acceptable to us. We are currently seeking additional financing in order to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to fund our operations, we will be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include curtailing or suspending operations, reducing headcount, selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to take any of these actions could occur at a time that is earlier than when we would otherwise exhaust our cash resources.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized, recorded and reported; and (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, to permit the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. As discussed elsewhere in this report, on March 12, 2024, we completed the XTI Merger. Legacy Inpixon was the legal acquirer in the XTI Merger, but Legacy XTI was the accounting acquirer in the XTI Merger under GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, the historical financial statements of Legacy XTI are considered the financial statements of the combined company. Prior to the XTI Merger, because Legacy XTI was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Legacy XTI did not have the necessary processes, systems, procedures, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the financial reporting requirements of a public company. During the second quarter of 2024, we commenced the process of integrating Legacy XTI into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. However, as of the date of this report, this integration of Legacy XTI is currently being evaluated by a third-party consulting firm that we engaged during the fourth quarter of 2024 to assist in the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls over financial reporting on the combined entity. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 As noted above, as of September 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. However, this integration of Legacy XTI is 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 currently being evaluated by the aforementioned third-party consulting firm as of the date of this report. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Control 
 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no material pending legal proceedings as defined by Item 103 of Regulation S-K, to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company s business and as described in Note 18 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report under the heading "Litigation." 
 
 There are no proceedings in which any of the directors, officers or affiliates of the Company, or any registered or beneficial holder of more than 5 of the Company s voting securities, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to that of the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by these risks. In addition to the risk factors set forth below and the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, which report is incorporated by reference herein, all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. 
 
 If we continue to fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 
 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Based upon an evaluation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. As discussed elsewhere in this report, on March 12, 2024, we completed the XTI Merger. Legacy Inpixon was the legal acquirer in the XTI Merger, but Legacy XTI was the accounting acquirer in the XTI Merger under GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, the historical financial statements of Legacy XTI are considered the financial statements of the combined company. Prior to the XTI Merger, because Legacy XTI was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Legacy XTI did not have the necessary processes, systems, procedures, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the financial reporting requirements of a public company. During the second quarter of 2024, we commenced the process of integrating Legacy XTI into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2024, we believe Legacy XTI has been fully integrated into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. However, as of the date of this report, this integration of Legacy XTI is currently being evaluated by a third-party consulting firm that we engaged during the fourth quarter of 2024 to assist in the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls over financial reporting on the combined entity. We cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take. 
 
 In order to improve and maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems and controls to accommodate such changes. Additionally, if these new systems, controls or standards and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that may arise. 
 
 Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and

 internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. 
 
 Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Our failure to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market may result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock, liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets. 
 
 Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the symbol XTIA. The listing standards of Nasdaq provide that a company, in order to qualify for continued listing, must maintain a minimum stock price of 1.00 and satisfy standards relative to minimum stockholders equity, minimum market value of publicly held shares and various additional requirements. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant negative consequences including: 
 
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 a determination that the common stock is a "penny stock" which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of common stock; 
 a limited amount of analyst coverage, if any; and 
 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
 
 Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 
 
 In several instances in the past, including as recently as on July 9, 2024, we received written notification from Nasdaq informing us that because the closing bid price of our common stock was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, our shares no longer complied with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Each time, we were given a period of 180 days from the date of the notification to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements by having the closing bid price of our common stock listed on Nasdaq be at least 1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading days. 
 
 In connection with the July 9, 2024 notice, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2025, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, on November 7, 2024, we received another letter (the "Low Price Deficiency Letter") from Nasdaq notifying us that, as of November 6, 2024, our common stock had a closing bid price of 0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days. Accordingly, we are subject to the provisions contemplated under Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) (the "Low Priced Stocks Rule"). As a result, Nasdaq has determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market (the "Determination"), unless we request an appeal of the Determination on or prior to November 14, 2024, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. We requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel") to appeal the Determination and to address compliance with the Low Priced Stocks Rule. The Low Price Deficiency Letter states that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. We will be asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance, which plan we are in the process of preparing. 
 The Low Price Deficiency Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq and our common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "XTIA." While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of our common stock would be stayed and our common stock would continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our appeal to the Panel or be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. 
 
 If our shares of common stock lose their status on Nasdaq, we believe that they would likely be eligible to be quoted on the inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., commonly referred to as the Pink Open Market and we may also qualify to be traded on their OTCQB market (The Venture Market). These markets are generally not considered to be as efficient as, and not as broad as, Nasdaq. Selling our shares on these markets could be more

 difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, and transactions could be delayed. In addition, in the event our shares are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock or even holding our common stock, further limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. 
 
 Adverse judgments or settlements in legal proceedings could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 
 We may be a party to claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which may include those related to, for example, our securities offerings, contracts, sub-contracts, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, adversary proceedings arising from customer bankruptcies, employment of our workforce and immigration requirements or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business. 
 
 Additionally, we are and we may be made a party to future claims relating to the XTI Merger. On December 6, 2023, Xeriant, Inc. Xeriant filed a complaint against Legacy XTI, along with two unnamed companies and five unnamed persons, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 31, 2024, Xeriant filed an amended complaint, which added us as a defendant. On February 2, 2024, the Court ordered Xeriant to show cause as to why the amended complaint should not be dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On February 29, 2024, Xeriant filed a second amended complaint, which removed us and one of the unnamed companies as defendants. The second amended complaint alleges that Legacy XTI, through multiple breaches and fraudulent actions, has caused substantial harm to Xeriant and has prevented it from obtaining compensation owed to it under various agreements entered into between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, including but not limited to a joint venture agreement, a cross-patent license agreement, an operating agreement, and a letter dated May 17, 2022 (the May 17 letter ). In particular, Xeriant contends that Legacy XTI gained substantial advantages from the intellectual property, expertise, and capital deployed by Xeriant in the design and development of Legacy XTI s TriFan 600 aircraft yet has excluded Xeriant from the transaction involving the TriFan 600 technology in its merger with us, which has resulted in a breach of the May 17 letter, in addition to the other aforementioned agreements. Xeriant, in the second amended complaint, asserts the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional fraud; (3) fraudulent concealment; (4) quantum meruit; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) unfair competition/deceptive business practices; and (7) misappropriation of confidential information, and seeks damages in excess of 500 million, injunctive relief enjoining us from engaging in any further misconduct, the imposition of a royalty obligation, and such other relief as deemed appropriate by the court. On March 13, 2024, Legacy XTI moved for partial dismissal of the second amended complaint, Counts 2 through 7 in particular. Legacy XTI argued that Counts 2 through 7 are (1) impermissible attempts to repackage claims arising from contractual dispute as quasi-contractual or tort claims; and (2) expressly refuted by the clear and unequivocal terms of the aforementioned agreements. The case is in its early stages, no discovery with respect to the Company has occurred, and we are unable to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of a potential adverse judgment. The Court has neither scheduled Legacy XTI s motion for hearing nor otherwise ruled upon it. Legacy XTI denies the allegations of wrongdoing contained in the second amended complaint and is vigorously defending against the lawsuit. 
 
 In connection with the litigation matter described in the immediately preceding paragraph, on June 12, 2024, we received a letter from counsel for Auctus Fund, LLC Auctus ), dated April 3, 2024, claiming that, pursuant to the above-referenced May 17 letter by and between Xeriant and Legacy XTI, as a result of the XTI Merger and Legacy XTI s entry into a promissory note agreement with Legacy Inpixon in March 2023, XTI Aerospace and Legacy XTI may have assumed Xeriant s obligations under that certain Senior Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of 6,050,000 issued by Xeriant to Auctus, including the obligation to repay Auctus all principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, which Auctus claims was 8,435,008.81 as of April 3, 2024. In July 2024, Legacy XTI responded to such letter and indicated that it believes that the May 17 letter is invalid and unenforceable on several bases. It further explained that even if it were valid and enforceable, Legacy XTI does not believe such letter resulted in, or otherwise triggered, the assumption of obligations of Xeriant under the Senior Secured Promissory Note or any other obligation on the part of Legacy XTI. There have been no further developments on this matter. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a potential loss, if any, on this matter. To the extent suits or actions are commenced with respect to this matter, we intend to vigorously defend against any and all claims. 
 
 On August 15, 2024, we became aware that Chardan Capital Markets LLC ("Chardan") commenced an arbitration (the "Arbitration") before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") against XTI Aerospace, Inc. and Legacy XTI related to an engagement letter, dated as of June 7, 2022, by and between Chardan and Legacy XTI, as amended (the "Chardan Engagement Letter"). In the Arbitration, Chardan alleges that XTI Aerospace, Inc. is bound by the Chardan Engagement Letter even though XTI Aerospace, Inc. did not sign or assume the Chardan Engagement Letter. XTI Aerospace, Inc. denies that it has any liability under the Chardan Engagement Letter. Chardan further alleges that Legacy XTI and XTI Aerospace, Inc. breached the Chardan Engagement Letter by not making separate payments to Chardan of 200,000, 94,511, 484,044.40 and 174,000. Chardan also seeks to recover unspecified amounts relating to its alleged right of first refusal to perform banking services that XTI Aerospace, Inc. supposedly did not honor, including with respect to the Company s ATM Offering with

 Maxim. XTI Aerospace, Inc. and Legacy XTI deny that Chardan performed its duties under the Chardan Engagement Letter and otherwise deny that Chardan is owed any sums under the Chardan Engagement Letter. XTI Aerospace, Inc. has filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to stay the Arbitration to the extent that it has been asserted against XTI Aerospace, Inc. XTI Aerospace, Inc. plans to prosecute the foregoing petition and, if the Arbitration is not stayed, defend against the Arbitration vigorously. 
 
 Regardless of the merits of any particular claim, responding to such actions could divert time, resources and management s attention away from our business operations, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits or other similar lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. 
 
 Furthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as deductibles and caps on amounts of coverage. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to coverage for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our available insurance coverage for a particular claim. 
 
 We may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. There is a risk that we will not be successful or otherwise be able to satisfactorily resolve such claims or litigation. Litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, litigation costs and attorneys fees, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in which we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our current financial status may increase our default and litigation risks and may make us more financially vulnerable in the face of threatened litigation. 
 
 The obligations to the Lender (as defined below) under the Notes (as defined below) and related agreements are secured by a security interest in all of our Legacy XTI common stock and all of the assets of Legacy XTI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, so if we default on those obligations, the Lender could proceed against any or all such assets. 
 
 Our obligations under the secured promissory notes (the Notes issued to Streeterville Capital, LLC (the Lender pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as of May 1, 2024, by and between us and the Lender (the Purchase Agreement ), and related agreements are secured by all of the Legacy XTI common stock owned by XTI Aerospace and all of the assets of Legacy XTI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a pledge agreement executed by us and a security agreement executed by Legacy XTI, respectively, in connection with the issuance of the Notes. As such, the Lender may enforce its security interests over our Legacy XTI common stock and the assets of Legacy XTI that secure the repayment of such obligations, take control of such assets and operations, force us to seek bankruptcy protection or force us to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in our securities could become worthless. 
 
 We are subject to certain contractual limitations that could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings. 
 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in connection with the issuance of the Notes to the Lender, we agreed to be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities until all of our obligations under the Notes, Purchase Agreement and all other related agreements are paid and performed in full. Specifically, we agreed, among other things, to not issue securities in any Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or issue or guarantee any debt or debt instrument, subject to certain exceptions; provided that the issuance by us of shares of common stock in an at-the-market offering will not be deemed a Variable Rate Transaction. Such restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate future financings. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, if we breach or allegedly breach such restrictions, we will be obligated to indemnify the Lender and all its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and agents for loss or damage arising as a result of or related to such breach or alleged breach, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

If we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Purchase Agreement or the Notes, there could be an event of default under the Notes, which could result in an acceleration of payments due under the Notes, the application of default interest and other consequences. 
 
 Failure to meet the restrictions, obligations and limitations under the Purchase Agreement and the Notes may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Notes. Such events include, among others, our failure to pay any amount when due and payable thereunder, us becoming insolvent or declaring bankruptcy, failure to observe or perform in any material respect any covenant, obligation, condition or agreement set forth in the Notes, Purchase Agreement or in any other transaction document if such default or breach remains uncured for a period of at least five business days, and our breach in any material respect or the occurrence of any event of default under any term or provision of any existing and future agreements and instruments between us and the Lender, which events could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Notes. Additionally, at any time following an event of default, upon written notice to us, interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the Notes beginning on the date the applicable event of default occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22 per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. Moreover, upon the occurrence of a sale of all or substantially all of the our assets, or a merger, consolidation, or other capital reorganization of the Company with or into another company in which the holders of equity of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to hold, after such transaction, 50 or less of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company, or such surviving entity (a change in control ), and without further notice to us, all unpaid principal, plus all accrued interest, original issue discount, and other amounts due under the Notes, will become immediately due and payable. Such consequences upon an event of default or a change in control could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if the Lender accelerates the Notes, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. 
 
 The redemption feature of the Notes may require us to make redemption payments at the request of the Lender, which redemptions may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our debts as they come due, and we may not have the required funds to pay such redemptions, which could result in an event of default under the Notes. 
 
 From time to time, beginning six months after issuance, the Lender may require us to redeem up to an aggregate of one-sixth (1/6) of the initial principal balance of each Note plus any accrued interest thereunder each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount by providing us written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice provided, however, that if the Lender does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount will be available for the Lender to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month s Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, we will be required to pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within five business days of our receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice. Such redemptions may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. In addition, we may not have the required funds to pay such redemptions and our failure to pay the redemptions, when due, may result in an event of default under the Notes. 
 
 The terms of the Series 9 Preferred Stock impose additional challenges on our ability to raise capital. 
 
 The terms of our Series 9 Preferred Stock contain a number of restrictive covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us while the Series 9 Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless the restrictions are waived by the consent of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, restrictions on our ability to (i) issue or sell any equity securities which result in net proceeds to the Company in excess of an aggregate of 10,000,000, (ii) enter into any agreement or otherwise agree to any covenant, condition, or obligation that locks up, restricts in any way or otherwise prohibits the Company from issuing common stock, preferred stock, warrants, convertible notes, other debt securities, or any other of our securities to any holder of Series 9 Preferred Stock or any affiliate of any such holder, except as may be required in connection with standstill provisions arising from a subsequent financing, provided, however, such standstill restriction shall not exceed more than 45 days without the Required Holders prior written consent which consent may be granted or withheld in the Required Holders sole and absolute discretion, (iii) issue, incur or guaranty any debt (excluding any intercompany debt) or issue any debt or equity securities in any variable rate transaction (which does not include the issuance of shares of common stock in an at-the-market offering, subject to the limitations set forth in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation) and (iv) create, authorize, or issue, or enter into any agreement to create, authorize, or issue, any class of preferred stock (including additional issuances of Series 9 Preferred Stock). 
 
 For example, sales of shares of our common stock, if any, pursuant to our ATM Offering are subject to the limitations set forth in a written consent (the "Series 9 ATM Consent") that we obtained on June 14, 2024 from the Required Holders (as defined below). The Series 9 ATM Consent provides that we may not, without the Required Holders prior written consent, register shares for sale under the ATM Offering in excess of the 47.4 million (the "ATM Maximum Amount") in shares of common stock registered pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279901) filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024 and declared effective on June 18, 2024 (the "Registration Statement"), a prospectus relating to the ATM Offering

 included in the Registration Statement and an accompanying base prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The Series 9 ATM Consent further provides that we may not issue or sell more than 6 million of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering ("Initial Tranche") without the Required Holders prior written consent, which consent we are required to obtain for each additional 5 million in sales of common stock under the ATM Offering after the Initial Tranche up to the ATM Maximum Amount. "Required Holders" is defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series 9 Preferred Stock; provided that, pursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement, dated as of March 12, 2024 (the "Securities Purchase Agreement"), between the Company and 3AM Investments LLC (an entity controlled by the Company's former director and former Chief Executive Officer, Nadir Ali) (the "Purchaser"), the Purchaser will be deemed a "Required Holder" as defined in the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation as long as the Purchaser holds any shares of Series 9 Preferred Stock. 
 
 A breach of the restrictive covenants under the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation could result in an event of default under the Series 9 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation which may require redemption of the Series 9 Preferred Stock. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to finance our operations through additional debt or equity financings and/or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
