 unconsolidated ventures which, were determined to be VIEs. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because the Company is a passive investor in, and has no control of, these entities and therefore does not have a controlling financial interests in these VIEs. These investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within investments in and advances to unconsolidated ventures. The Company s maximum exposure to loss is limited to its investments in these VIEs. The Company has not provided financial support to these unconsolidated VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 The Company uses a current expected credit loss model CECL for estimating the provision for loan losses on its loan portfolio. The CECL model requires the consideration of possible credit losses over the life of an instrument and includes a portfolio-based component and an asset-specific component. In compliance with the CECL reporting requirements, the Company supplements its existing credit monitoring and management processes with additional processes to support the calculation of the CECL reserves. The Company engages a third-party service provider to provide market data and a credit loss model. The credit loss model is a forward-looking, econometric, commercial real estate CRE loss forecasting tool. It is comprised of a probability of default PD model and a loss given default LGD model that, layered together with the Company s loan-level data, fair value of collateral, net operating income of collateral, selected forward-looking macroeconomic variables, and pool-level mean loss rates, produces life of loan expected losses EL at the loan and portfolio level. Where management has determined that the credit loss model does not fully capture certain external factors, including portfolio trends or loan-specific factors, a qualitative adjustment to the reserve is recorded. In addition, interest receivable on loans is not included in the Company s CECL calculations as the Company performs timely write offs of aged interest receivable. The Company has made a policy election to write off aged receivables through interest income as opposed to through the CECL provision on its statements of income. 
 
 Loans for which the borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty, and where repayment of the loan is expected substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral, are considered collateral dependent loans. For collateral dependent loans, the Company may elect a practical expedient that allows the Company to measure expected losses based on the difference between the collateral s fair value and the amortized cost basis of the loan. When the repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on a sale, rather than operations of the collateral, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell the collateral. If foreclosure is probable, the Company is required to measure for expected losses using this methodology. 
 
 The Company generally will use the direct capitalization rate valuation methodology or the sales comparison approach to estimate the fair value of the collateral for loans and in certain cases will obtain external appraisals. Determining fair value of the collateral may take into account a number of assumptions including, but not limited to, cash flow projections, market capitalization rates, discount rates and data regarding recent comparable sales of similar properties. Such assumptions are generally based on current market conditions and are subject to economic and market uncertainties. 
 
 The Company s loans are typically collateralized by real estate directly or indirectly. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan-by-loan basis. Specifically, a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess: (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future; (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at maturity; and/or (iii) the property s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic submarket in which the collateral property is located. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and underwriting personnel, who utilize various data sources, including: (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrowers business plan, and capitalization and discount rates; (ii) site inspections; and (iii) current credit spreads and other market data and ultimately presented to management for approval. 
 
 When a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and a loan is modified, the effect of the modification will be included in the Company s assessment of the CECL allowance for loan losses. If the Company provides principal forgiveness, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance for loan losses. Generally, when modifying loans, the Company will seek to protect its position by requiring incremental pay downs, additional collateral or guarantees and, in some cases, lookback features or equity interests to offset concessions granted should conditions impacting the loan improve. 
 
 The Company designates a loan as a non-accrual loan generally when: (i) the principal or coupon interest components of loan payments become 90-days past due; or (ii) in the opinion of the Company, recovery of principal and coupon interest is doubtful. Interest income on non-accrual loans in which the Company reasonably expects a recovery of the loan s outstanding principal

Overview 
 
 Ladder is an internally-managed real estate investment trust REIT that is a leader in commercial real estate finance. We originate and invest in a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate-related assets, focusing on senior secured assets. Our investment activities include: (i) our primary business of originating senior first mortgage fixed and floating rate loans collateralized by commercial real estate with flexible loan structures; (ii) owning and operating commercial real estate, including net leased commercial properties; and (iii) investing in investment grade securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate. We believe that our in-house origination platform, ability to flexibly allocate capital among complementary product lines, credit-centric underwriting approach, access to diversified financing sources, and experienced management team position us well to deliver attractive returns on equity to our shareholders through economic and credit cycles. 

Our businesses, including balance sheet lending, conduit lending, securities investments, and real estate investments, provide for a stable base of net interest and rental income. We have originated 29.8 billion of commercial real estate loans from our inception in October 2008 through September 30, 2024. During this timeframe, we also acquired 13.8 billion of predominantly investment grade-rated securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and 2.1 billion of selected net leased and other real estate assets. 
 
 As part of our commercial mortgage lending operations, we originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized, income producing commercial real estate properties that we intend to make available for sale in commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS securitizations. From our inception in October 2008 through September 30, 2024, we originated 16.9 billion of conduit loans, of which 16.9 billion were sold into 74 CMBS securitizations, making us, by volume, we have been one of the largest non-bank contributors of loans to CMBS securitizations in the United States in such period. Our sales of loans into securitizations are generally accounted for as true sales, not financings, and we generally retain no ongoing interest in loans which we securitize unless we are required to do so as issuer pursuant to the risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended, (the Dodd-Frank Act ). The securitization of conduit loans enables us to reinvest our equity capital into new loan originations or allocate it to other investments. 
 
 We maintain a diversified and flexible financing strategy supporting our investment strategy and overall business operations, including the use of unsecured corporate bonds, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market Collateralized Loan Obligations CLO debt issuances and committed term financing from leading financial institutions. Refer to Our Financing Strategies and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information. 
 
 Ladder was founded in October 2008 and we completed our IPO in February 2014. We are led by a disciplined and highly aligned management team. As of September 30, 2024, our management team and directors held interests in our Company comprising over 11 of our total equity. On average, our management team members have 28 years of experience in the industry. Our management team includes Brian Harris, Chief Executive Officer; Pamela McCormack, President; Paul J. Miceli, Chief Financial Officer; Robert Perelman, Head of Asset Management; and Kelly Porcella, Chief Administrative Officer General Counsel. Anthony V. Esposito, Chief Accounting Officer, and Stephanie Lin, Assistant Secretary, are additional officers of Ladder. 
 
 We continue to actively manage the liquidity and operations of the Company in light of market conditions, including the current interest rate environment, and potential recessionary conditions. The Company has disclosed the impact of current market conditions on our business throughout this Quarterly Report.

Our Businesses 
 
 We invest primarily in loans, securities and other interests in U.S. commercial real estate, with a focus on senior secured assets. Our complementary business segments are designed to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically allocate capital in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns under varying market conditions. The following chart summarizes our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 in thousands): 

(1) CRE equity asset amounts represent undepreciated asset values. 
 
 There are a number of factors that influence our operating results. Some of these factors include: (1) our competition; (2) market and economic conditions, including inflation; (3) loan origination and repayment volume; (4) profitability of securitizations; (5) avoidance of credit losses; (6) availability of debt and equity funding and the costs of that funding; (7) the net interest margin on our investments; (8) effectiveness of our hedging and other risk management practices; (9) real estate transaction volumes; (10) occupancy rates; and (11) expense management. Refer the heading Results of Operations. 
 
 Loans 
 
 Balance Sheet First Mortgage Loans. We originate and invest in balance sheet first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties that are typically undergoing transition, including lease-up, sell-out, and renovation or repositioning. These mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the property owners, and generally have Term SOFR-based floating rates and terms (including extension options) ranging from one to five years. Our loans are directly originated by an internal team that has longstanding and strong relationships with borrowers and mortgage brokers throughout the United States. We follow a rigorous investment process, which begins with an initial due diligence review; continues through a comprehensive legal and underwriting process incorporating multiple internal and external checks and balances; and culminates in approval or disapproval of each prospective investment by our Investment Committee. Balance sheet first mortgage loans in excess of 50.0 million also require the approval of our board of directors Risk and Underwriting Committee. 
 
 We generally seek to hold our balance sheet first mortgage loans for investment although we also maintain the flexibility to contribute such loans into a CLO or similar structure, sell participation interests or b-notes in our mortgage loans or sell such mortgage loans as whole loans. Our balance sheet first mortgage loans may be refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization. As of September 30, 2024, we held a portfolio of 57 balance sheet first mortgage loans with an aggregate book value of 2.0 billion. Based on the loan balances and the as-is third-party Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of this portfolio was 66.4 at September 30, 2024.

 Other Commercial Real Estate-Related Loans. We selectively invest in note purchase financings, subordinated debt, mezzanine debt and other structured finance products related to commercial real estate that are generally held for investment. As of September 30, 2024, we held a portfolio of 5 mezzanine loans with an aggregate book value of 13.8 million. Based on the loan balance and the as-is third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the portfolio was 73.6 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Conduit First Mortgage Loans. We also originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans that are secured by cash-flowing commercial real estate and are available for sale to securitizations. These first mortgage loans are typically structured with fixed interest rates and generally have five- to ten-year terms. Conduit first mortgage loans are originated, underwritten, approved and funded using the same comprehensive legal and underwriting approach, process and personnel used to originate our balance sheet first mortgage loans. Conduit first mortgage loans in excess of 50.0 million also require approval of our board of directors Risk and Underwriting Committee. We held one conduit loan with an aggregate carrying value of 27.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Although our primary intent is to sell our conduit first mortgage loans to CMBS trusts, we generally seek to maintain the flexibility to keep them on our balance sheet, sell participation interests or B-notes in such loans or sell the loans as whole loans. The Company holds these conduit loans in its taxable REIT subsidiary TRS upon origination. As of September 30, 2024, we held one conduit first mortgage loan that was available for contribution into securitizations. Based on the loan balance and the as-is third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, loan-to-value ratio of this loan was 59.4 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following charts set forth our total outstanding balance sheet first mortgage loans, other commercial real estate-related loans, and conduit first mortgage loans as of September 30, 2024, and a breakdown of our loan portfolio by loan size and geographic location and asset type of the underlying real estate by loan balance.

Real Estate 
 
 Net Leased Commercial Real Estate Properties. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 155 single tenant net leased properties with an undepreciated book value of 637.3 million. These properties are fully leased on a net basis where the tenant is generally responsible for payment of real estate taxes, property, building and general liability insurance and property and building maintenance expenses. As of September 30, 2024, our net leased properties comprised a total of 3.7 million square feet, 100 leased with an average age since construction of 19.5 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.9 years. Commercial real estate investments in excess of 20.0 million require the approval of our board of directors Risk and Underwriting Committee. The majority of the tenants in our net leased properties are necessity-based businesses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 100 of rent on these properties. 
 
 Diversified Commercial Real Estate Properties. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 54 diversified commercial real estate properties throughout the U.S with an undepreciated book value of 308.3 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 99 of rent on these properties. 
 
 The following charts summarize the composition of our real estate investments as of September 30, 2024 in millions): 

Securities 
 
 We invest in primarily AAA-rated real estate securities, typically front pay securities, with relatively short duration and significant subordination. We invest primarily in CMBS, including CLOs, secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate. These investments provide a stable and attractive base of net interest income and help us manage our liquidity and hyper-amortization features included in many of these securities positions help mitigate potential credit losses in the event of adverse market conditions. We have significant in-house expertise in the evaluation and trading of these securities, due in part to our experience in originating and underwriting mortgage loans that comprise assets within CMBS trusts, as well as our experience in structuring CMBS transactions.

 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our portfolio of CMBS investments totaled 843.4 million in 95 CUSIPs 8.9 million average investment per CUSIP). Included in the 843.4 million of CMBS securities are 9.1 million of CMBS securities designated as risk retention securities under the Dodd-Frank Act, which are subject to transfer restrictions over the term of the securitization trust. The following chart summarizes our securities investments by market value, 98 of which were rated investment grade by Standard Poor s Ratings Group, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Inc. as of September 30, 2024:

The commercial real estate collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, by property count and market value, respectively, 59.9 and 65.5 of the collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio was distributed throughout the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas MSAs in the United States, with 4.8 and 11.9 , by property count and market value, respectively, of the collateral located in the New York-Newark-Jersey City MSA, and the concentrations in each of the remaining top 24 MSAs ranging from 0.2 to 5.8 by property count and 0.1 to 8.2 by market value. 
 
 AAA-rated CMBS or U.S. Agency securities investments in excess of 76.0 million and all other investment grade CMBS or U.S. Agency securities investments in excess of 51.0 million, each in any single class of any single issuance, require the approval of our board of directors Risk and Underwriting Committee. The Risk and Underwriting Committee also must approve any investments in non-rated or sub-investment grade CMBS or U.S. Agency securities in any single class of any single issuance in excess of the lesser of (x) 21.0 million and (y) 10 of the total net asset value of the respective Ladder subsidiary or other entity for which Ladder has authority to make investment decisions. 
 
 Other Investments 
 
 Unconsolidated Ventures. From time to time we invest in real estate related ventures. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our unconsolidated ventures was 20.0 million. 
 
 United States Treasury Securities. We invest in short-term and long-term U.S. Treasury securities. Short-term U.S. Treasury securities are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we held 1.3 billion of U.S. Treasury securities classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. 

Our Financing Strategies 
 
 Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our financing to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties. In addition to cash flow from operations, we fund our operations and investment strategy through a diverse array of funding sources, including: 
 
 Unsecured corporate bonds 
 CLO transactions 
 Secured loan and securities repurchase facilities 
 Non-recourse mortgage debt 
 Revolving credit facility

Table of Contents 

 Loan sales and securitizations 
 Unencumbered assets available for financing 
 Equity 
 
 From time to time, we may add financing counterparties that we believe will complement our business, although the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Our amended and restated charter and by-laws do not impose any threshold limits on our ability to use leverage. Refer to our discussion below and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 6, Debt Obligations, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, for additional information about our financing arrangements. 
 
 Unsecured Corporate Bonds 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.1 billion of unsecured corporate bonds outstanding. These unsecured financings were comprised of 322.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25 senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), 611.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25 senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes ), 633.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00 senior notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes, and collectively with the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the Notes ). The 2031 Notes were issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an aggregate principal balance of 500.0 million. 
 
 Due in large part to devoting such a large portion of the Company s capital structure to equity and unsecured corporate bond debt, Ladder maintains a 3.6 billion pool of unencumbered assets, comprised primarily of first mortgage loans and unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 CLO Debt 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 776.1 million of matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse CLO debt included in debt obligations on its consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 On July 13, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately-marketed CLO transaction, which generated 498.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing 607.5 million of loans Contributed July 2021 Loans at an 82 advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis. A consolidated subsidiary of the Company retained an 18 subordinate and controlling interest in the CLO. The Company retained control over major decisions made with respect to the administration of the Contributed July 2021 Loans, including broad discretion in managing these loans, and has the ability to appoint the special servicer under the CLO. 
 
 On December 2, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately-marketed CLO transaction, which generated 566.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing 729.4 million of loans Contributed December 2021 Loans at a 77.6 advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis.

The Company retained control over major decisions made with respect to the administration of the Contributed December 2021 Loans, including broad discretion in managing these loans, and has the ability to appoint the special servicer under the CLO. 
 
 Committed Loan Financing Facilities 
 
 We are parties to multiple committed loan repurchase agreement facilities, totaling 1.2 billion of credit capacity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 244.5 million of borrowings outstanding, with an additional 911.5 million of committed financing available. Assets pledged as collateral under these facilities are generally limited to first mortgage whole mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and certain interests in such first mortgage and mezzanine loans. Our repurchase facilities include covenants covering net worth requirements, minimum liquidity levels, and maximum debt/equity ratios. 
 
 We have the option to extend some of our existing facilities subject to a number of customary conditions. The lenders have sole discretion to include collateral in these facilities and to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, and, if the estimated market value of the included collateral declines, the lenders have the right to require additional collateral or a full and/or partial repayment of the facilities (margin call) sufficient to rebalance the facilities. Typically, the lender establishes a maximum percentage of the collateral asset s market value that can be borrowed. We often borrow at a lower percentage of the 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 collateral asset s value than the maximum, leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon at a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis. 
 
 Securities Repurchase Facilities 
 
 We are a party to multiple uncommitted master repurchase agreements with several counterparties to finance our investments in CMBS and U.S. Agency securities. The securities that serve as collateral for these borrowings are typically AAA-rated CMBS with relatively short duration and significant subordination. The lenders have sole discretion to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, and, if the estimated market value of the collateral declines, the lenders have the right to require additional cash collateral. If the estimated market value of the collateral subsequently increases, we have the right to call back excess cash collateral. 
 
 Mortgage Loan Financing 
 
 We generally finance our real estate using long-term non-recourse mortgage financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed 16 new term debt agreements to finance properties in its real estate portfolio with a carrying amount of 81.9 million. Our mortgage loan financings have primarily fixed rates ranging from 4.39 to 8.78 , mature between 2024 and 2034 and total 513.8 million as of September 30, 2024. These long-term non-recourse mortgages include net unamortized premiums of 3.9 million at September 30, 2024, representing proceeds received upon financing greater than the contractual amounts due under the agreements. The premiums are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method. We recorded 0.6 million of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The loans are collateralized by real estate and related lease intangibles, net, of 530.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 The Company s revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of 323.9 million, including a 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is available on a revolving basis to finance the Company s working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility incur interest at a fixed margin of 2.50 over the index rate, with reductions in the fixed margin upon the achievement of investment grade credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, but still maintains the ability to draw 323.9 million. 
 
 The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of the shares of (or other ownership or equity interests in) certain subsidiaries to the extent the pledge is not restricted under existing regulations, law or contractual obligations. 
 
 LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, restricted payments, sales of assets and affiliate transactions under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, LCFH is required to comply with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage, consistent with our other credit facilities. 
 
 Hedging Strategies 
 
 We may enter into interest rate and credit spread derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. We generally seek to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly-originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in our CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of our U.S. Agency securities portfolio. We monitor our asset profile and our hedge positions to manage our interest rate and credit spread exposures, and we seek to match fund our assets according to the liquidity characteristics and expected holding periods of our assets. 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 
 We generally seek to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3.0:1.0 or below. We expect this ratio to fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year due to the normal course of business. This ratio may also fluctuate as a result of our conduit lending operations, in which we generally securitize our inventory of conduit loans at intervals, and also because of changes in our asset mix, due in part to such securitizations. We generally seek to match fund our assets according to their liquidity characteristics and expected hold period. We believe that the defensive positioning of our predominantly senior secured assets and our

 financing strategy has allowed us to maintain financial flexibility to capitalize on an attractive range of market opportunities as they have arisen. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future. However, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt in the indentures governing the Notes (the Indentures and our other debt agreements. Under the Indentures, we may not incur certain types of indebtedness unless our consolidated non-funding debt to equity ratio (as defined in the Indentures) is less than or equal to 1.75:1.00 or if the unencumbered assets of the Company and its subsidiaries is less than 120 of their unsecured indebtedness, although our subsidiaries are permitted to incur indebtedness where recourse is limited to the assets and/or the general credit of such subsidiary. 
 
 Our borrowings under certain financing agreements and our committed repurchase facilities are subject to maximum consolidated leverage ratio limits (either a fixed ratio ranging from 3.5:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, or a maximum ratio based on our asset composition at the time of determination), minimum net worth requirements (ranging from 400.0 million to 871.4 million), maximum reductions in net worth over stated time periods, minimum liquidity levels (typically 30.0 million of cash or a higher standard that often allows for the inclusion of different percentages of liquid securities in the determination of compliance with the requirement), and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, and, in the instance of one lender, an interest coverage ratio of 1.50x, in each case, if certain liquidity thresholds are not satisfied. Leverage ratio limits exclude CLO financing for purposes of this covenant calculation. These restrictions, which would permit us to incur substantial additional debt, are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. 
 
 Further, certain of our financing arrangements and loans on our real property are secured by the assets of the Company, including pledges of the equity of certain subsidiaries or the assets of certain subsidiaries. From time to time, certain of these financing arrangements and loans may prohibit certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends to the Company, from making distributions on such subsidiary s capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary s property or other assets to the Company or other subsidiaries of the Company. 
 
 We are in compliance with all covenants as described in this Quarterly Report as of September 30, 2024.

 The 2.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the timing of acquisitions of property via foreclosure that occurred after September 30, 2023, partially offset by the sale of one hotel property during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 
 Most of our consolidated income tax provision related to the business units held in our TRSs. The decrease in expense of 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 is primarily a result of changes in income generated by our TRSs. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The management of our liquidity and capital diversity and allocation strategies is critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our sources of liquidity to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties. 
 
 We require substantial amounts of capital to support our business. The management team, in consultation with our board of directors, establishes our overall liquidity and capital allocation strategies. A key objective of those strategies is to support the execution of our business strategy while maintaining sufficient ongoing liquidity throughout the business cycle to service our financial obligations as they become due. When making funding and capital allocation decisions, members of our senior management consider: business performance; the availability of, and costs and benefits associated with, different funding sources; current and expected capital markets and general economic conditions; our asset composition and capital structure; and our targeted liquidity profile and risks relating to our funding needs. 
 
 To ensure that Ladder can effectively address the funding needs of the Company on a timely basis, we maintain a diverse array of liquidity sources including: (1) cash and cash equivalents; (2) cash generated from operations; (3) proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured bonds; (4) borrowings under repurchase agreements; (5) principal repayments on investments including mortgage loans and securities; (6) borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; (7) proceeds from securitizations and sales of loans; (8) proceeds from the sale of securities; (9) proceeds from the sale of real estate; (10) proceeds from the issuance of CLO debt and other non-mark-to-market loan financing; and (11) proceeds from the issuance of equity capital. We use these funding sources to meet our obligations on a timely basis and have the ability to use our significant unencumbered asset base to further finance our business. 
 
 Our primary uses of liquidity are for: (1) the funding of loan, real estate-related and securities investments; (2) the repayment of short-term and long-term borrowings and related interest; (3) the funding of our operating expenses; and (4) distributions to our equity investors to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. We require short-term liquidity to fund loans that we originate and hold on our consolidated balance sheet pending sale, including through whole loan sale, participation, or securitization. We generally require longer-term funding to finance the loans and real estate-related investments that we hold for investment. We have historically used the aforementioned funding sources to meet the operating and investment needs as they have arisen and have been able to do so by applying a rigorous approach to long and short-term cash and debt forecasting.

 In addition, as a REIT, we are also required to make sufficient dividend payments to our shareholders in amounts at least sufficient to maintain our REIT status. Under IRS guidance, we may elect to pay a portion of our dividends in stock, subject to a cash/stock election by our shareholders, to optimize our level of capital retention. Accordingly, our cash requirement to pay dividends to maintain REIT status could be substantially reduced at the discretion of the board of directors. 
 
 Our principal debt financing sources include: (1) long-term senior unsecured notes in the form of corporate bonds; (2) CLO issuances; (3) committed secured funding provided by banks and other lenders; (4) long term non-recourse mortgage financing; (5) uncommitted secured funding sources, including asset repurchase agreements with a number of banks; and (6) unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our assets, including credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized, may involve one or more lenders and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments. 
 
 Refer to Financial Covenants and Our Financing Strategies for further disclosure of our diverse financing sources and, for a summary of our financial obligations, refer to the Contractual Obligations table below. All of our existing financial obligations due within the following year can be extended for one or more additional years at our discretion, refinanced or repaid at maturity or are incurred in the normal course of business (i.e., interest payments/loan funding obligations). 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 
 We held cash and cash equivalents of 1.6 billion and restricted cash of 12.3 million as of September 30, 2024. We held cash and cash equivalents of 1.0 billion and restricted cash of 15.4 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table provides a breakdown of the net change in our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in thousands):

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 
 We experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 623.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting cash provided by operating activities of 194.0 million, cash provided by investing activities of 733.7 million and cash used in financing activities of (304.4) million. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 194.0 million was primarily driven by net interest income and net increases in operating income on our real estate portfolio and related to the timing of purchases of 79.7 million of U.S. Treasury securities purchased and not yet settled on its consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 733.7 million was driven by 1.1 billion of repayment from mortgage loan receivables, 208.4 million in repayments on securities, 57.6 million in proceeds from sale of real estate and 10.6 million of proceeds from sale of securities, partially offset by (583.0) million in purchases of securities and (71.8) million of origination of mortgage loans held for investment. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities of (304.4) million was primarily as a result of net repayments of borrowings of (194.9) million, (88.8) million of dividend payments, (8.9) million of shares acquired to satisfy minimum federal and state tax withholdings on restricted stock, (2.0) million purchase of treasury stock, and (9.6) million in deferred financing cost.

 Borrowings under various financing arrangements 
 
 Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our leverage policies to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple counterparties. Our borrowings under various financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024 are set forth in the table below in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Committed loan repurchase facilities 244,525 Uncommitted securities repurchase facilities Total repurchase facilities 244,525 Mortgage loan financing(1) 513,781 CLO debt(2) 776,096 Senior unsecured notes(3) 2,050,930 Total debt obligations, net 3,585,332 
 
 (1) Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.2 million and net of premiums of 3.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 0.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 16.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s repurchase facilities include covenants covering minimum net worth requirements (ranging from 400.0 million to 871.4 million), maximum reductions in net worth over stated time periods, minimum liquidity levels (typically 30.0 million of cash or a higher standard that often allows for the inclusion of different percentages of liquid securities in the determination of compliance with the requirement), maximum leverage ratios (calculated in various ways based on specified definitions of indebtedness and net worth) and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, and, in the instance of one lender, an interest coverage ratio of 1.50x, in each case, if certain liquidity thresholds are not satisfied. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Further, certain of our financing arrangements and loans on our real property are secured by the assets of the Company, including pledges of the equity of certain subsidiaries or the assets of certain subsidiaries. From time to time, certain of these financing arrangements and loans may prohibit certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends to the Company, from making distributions on such subsidiary s capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary s property or other assets to the Company or other subsidiaries of the Company.

 Committed Loan Facilities 
 
 We are a party to multiple committed loan repurchase agreement facilities, totaling 1.2 billion of credit capacity as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 244.5 million of borrowings outstanding, with an additional 911.5 million of committed financing available. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 605.0 million of borrowings outstanding, with an additional 637.0 million of committed financing available. Assets pledged as collateral under these facilities are generally limited to whole mortgage loans collateralized by first liens on commercial real estate, mezzanine loans collateralized by equity interests in entities that own commercial real estate, and certain interests in such first mortgage and mezzanine loans. Our repurchase facilities include covenants covering net worth requirements, minimum liquidity levels, and maximum debt/equity ratios. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have the option to extend some of our existing facilities subject to a number of customary conditions. The lenders have sole discretion with respect to the inclusion of collateral in these facilities, to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, and, if the estimated market value of the included collateral declines, the lenders have the right to require additional collateral or a full and/or partial repayment of the facilities (margin call), sufficient to rebalance the facilities. Typically, the facilities are established with stated guidelines regarding the maximum percentage of the collateral asset s market value that can be borrowed. We often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset s value than the maximum leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon at a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis. 
 
 Uncommitted Securities Facilities 
 
 We are a party to multiple master repurchase agreements with several counterparties to finance our investments in CMBS and U.S. Agency securities. The securities that served as collateral for these borrowings are highly liquid and marketable assets that are typically of relatively short duration. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 The Company s revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of 323.9 million, including a 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is available on a revolving basis to finance the Company s working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility incur interest at a fixed margin of 2.50 over the index rate, with reductions in the fixed margin upon the achievement of investment grade credit ratings. On January 25, 2024, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility to extend the final maturity date to January 25, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, but still maintains the ability to draw 323.9 million. 
 
 The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of the shares of (or other ownership or equity interests in) certain subsidiaries to the extent the pledge is not restricted under existing regulations, law or contractual obligations. 
 
 The Company is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, restricted payments, sales of assets and affiliate transactions. In addition, the Company is required to comply with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage, consistent with our other credit facilities. The Company s ability to borrow is dependent on, among other things, compliance with the financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, fees or other amounts, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-default to other indebtedness, the rendering of judgments against the Company or certain of our subsidiaries to pay certain amounts of money and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 
 Mortgage Loan Financing 
 
 The Company typically finances its real estate investments with long-term, non-recourse mortgage financing. These mortgage loans have carrying amounts of 513.8 million and 437.8 million, net of unamortized premiums of 3.9 million and 1.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, representing proceeds received upon financing greater than the contractual amounts due under these agreements. The premiums are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method. The Company recorded 0.6 million of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These non-recourse debt agreements provide for secured financing at rates ranging from 4.39 to 8.78 , and, as of September 30, 2024, have anticipated maturity dates between 2024 and 2034, with an average term of 3.5 years. The mortgage loans are collateralized by

 real estate and related lease intangibles, net, of 530.2 million and 474.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed six and 16 new term debt agreements, respectively, to finance properties in its real estate portfolio with carrying amounts of 13.0 million and 81.9 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not execute any term debt agreements. 
 
 Collateralized Loan Obligations CLO Debt 
 
 On July 13, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately-marketed CLO transaction, which generated 498.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing 607.5 million of loans Contributed July 2021 Loans at an 82 advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis. A consolidated subsidiary of the Company retained an 18 subordinate and controlling interest in the CLO. The Company retained consent rights over major decisions with respect to the servicing of the Contributed July 2021 Loans, including the right to appoint and replace the special servicer under the CLO. The CLO is a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidated the VIE. Refer to Note 9, Consolidated Variable Interest Entities for additional information. 
 
 On December 2, 2021, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company completed a privately-marketed CLO transaction, which generated 566.2 million of gross proceeds to Ladder, financing 729.4 million of loans Contributed December 2021 Loans at a maximum 77.6 advance rate on a matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse basis. A consolidated subsidiary of the Company retained an 15.6 subordinate and controlling interest in the CLO. The Company also held two additional tranches as investments totaling 6.8 interest in the CLO. The Company retained consent rights over major decisions with respect to the servicing of the Contributed December 2021 Loans, including the right to appoint and replace the special servicer under the CLO. The CLO is a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidated the VIE. Refer to Note 9, Consolidated Variable Interest Entities for additional information. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 776.1 million of matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse CLO debt included in debt obligations on its consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs of 0.2 million were included in CLO debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.1 billion of matched term, non-mark-to-market and non-recourse CLO debt included in debt obligations on its consolidated balance sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs of 2.1 million were included in CLO debt as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no debt outstanding with the FHLB. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, Tuebor had 115.0 million of borrowings outstanding, with terms of 0.3 years to 0.75 years (with a weighted average of 0.57 years), interest rates of 5.76 to 5.88 (with a weighted average of 5.82 ), and advance rates of 71.7 to 95.7 on eligible collateral. As of December 31, 2023, collateral for the borrowings was comprised primarily of 140.3 million of CMBS. 
 
 Tuebor is subject to state regulations which require that dividends (including dividends to the Company as its parent) may only be made with regulatory approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would obtain such approval if sought. Largely as a result of this restriction, approximately 879.0 million of Tuebor s member s capital was restricted from transfer via dividend to Tuebor s parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at September 30, 2024. To facilitate intercompany cash funding of operations and investments, Tuebor and its parent maintain regulator-approved intercompany borrowing/lending agreements. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2.1 billion of unsecured corporate bonds outstanding. These unsecured financings were comprised of 322.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25 senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), 611.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25 senior notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes and 633.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75 senior notes due 2029 and 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00 senior notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes , collectively with the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the Notes ). The 2031 Notes were issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an aggregate principal balance of 500.0 million.

 LCFH issued the Notes with Ladder Capital Finance Corporation LCFC ), as co-issuers on a joint and several basis. LCFC is a 100 owned finance subsidiary of LCFH with no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Notes. The Company and certain subsidiaries of LCFH currently guarantee the obligations under the Notes and the indenture. The Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants of the Notes as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Notes are presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 16.9 million and 11.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears, are unsecured, and are subject to an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt covenant. The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, prior to their stated maturity upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price as specified in each respective indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The board of directors has authorized the Company to repurchase any or all of the Notes from time to time without further approval.

 Stock Repurchases 
 
 On April 24, 2024, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of 75.0 million of the Company s Class A common stock from time to time without further approval. This authorization increased the remaining outstanding authorization per the July 27, 2022 authorization from 43.6 million to 75.0 million. Stock repurchases by the Company are generally made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices but may also be made in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a remaining amount available for repurchase of 73.6 million, which represents 5.0 in the aggregate of its outstanding Class A common stock, based on the closing price of 11.60 per share on such date.

 (1) Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases. 
 (2) On April 24, 2024 the Board authorized repurchases up to 75.0 million in aggregate. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 In order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, it must annually distribute at least 90 of its taxable income. The Company has paid and in the future intends to declare regular quarterly distributions to its shareholders in aggregating to an amount approximating at least 90 of the REIT s annual net taxable income. 
 
 All distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, any debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions on making distributions under Delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.

 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 were as follows in thousands): 
 Contractual Obligations (1) Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Secured financings(2) 397,886 205,033 24,598 128,055 755,572 Senior unsecured notes 321,953 611,939 1,133,919 2,067,811 Interest payable(3) 109,625 139,498 77,674 28,168 354,965 Other funding obligations(4) 14,444 14,444 Operating lease obligations 558 4,426 4,537 11,039 20,560 Total 522,513 670,910 718,748 1,301,181 3,213,352 
 
 (1) As more fully disclosed in Note 6, Debt Obligations, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, the allocation of repayments under our committed loan repurchase facilities is based on the earlier of: (i) the maturity date of each agreement; or (ii) the maximum maturity date of the collateral loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower. 
 (2) Total does not include 776.3 million of consolidated CLO debt obligations and the related debt issuance costs of 0.2 million, as the satisfaction of these liabilities will not require cash outlays from us. 
 (3) Comprised of interest on secured financings and on senior unsecured notes. For borrowings with variable interest rates, we used the rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 to determine the future interest payment obligations. 
 (4) Comprised primarily of our off-balance sheet unfunded commitment to provide additional first mortgage loan financing as of September 30, 2024. The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments is based on the earlier of the commitment expiration date or the final maturity date, however, we may be obligated to fund these commitments earlier than such date. This amount excludes 43.4 million of future funding commitments that require the occurrence of certain good news events, such as the owner concluding a lease agreement with a major tenant in the building or reaching a pre-determined net operating income which may or may not be achieved. 
 
 The table above does not include amounts due under our derivative agreements as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments. Our contractual obligations will be refinanced and/or repaid from earnings as well as amortization and sales of our liquid collateral. We have made investments in various unconsolidated ventures of which our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments. 
 
 Future Liquidity Needs 
 
 In addition to the future contractual obligations above, the Company, in the coming year and beyond, as a part of its normal course of business will require cash to fund unfunded loan commitments and new investments in a combination of balance sheet mortgage loans, conduit loans, real estate investments and securities as it deems appropriate as well as necessary expenses as a part of general corporate purposes. These new investments and general corporate expenses may be funded with existing cash, proceeds from loan and securities payoffs, through financing using our Revolving Credit Facility or loan and security financing facilities, or through additional debt or equity raises. The Company has no known material cash requirements other than its contractual obligations in the above table, unfunded commitments and future general corporate expenses. 
 
 Unfunded Loan Commitments 
 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our borrowers. These commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 58.4 million of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment. 74 of these unfunded commitments would only be funded upon the occurrence of certain good news events, such as the owner concluding a lease agreement with a major tenant in the building or reaching some pre-determined net operating income. As of December 31, 2023, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 204.0 million of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment to provide additional first mortgage loan financing. Such commitments are subject to our borrowers satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments are subject to our loan borrowers satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and may or may not be funded depending on a variety of circumstances including timing, credit metric hurdles, and other nonfinancial events occurring.

 Interest Rate Environment 
 
 The nature of the Company s business exposes it to market risk arising from changes in interest rates. Changes, both increases and decreases, in the rates the Company is able to charge its borrowers, the yields the Company is able to achieve in its securities investments, and the Company s cost of borrowing directly impacts its net income. The Company s net interest income includes interest from both fixed and floating rate debt. The percentage of the Company s assets and liabilities bearing interest at fixed and floating rates may change over time, and asset composition may differ materially from debt composition. Refer to Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further disclosures surrounding the impact of rising or falling interest rate on our earnings. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. The Company s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Company s financial results. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and, therefore, routinely require adjustment. 
 During 2024, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting policies and estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following is a list of accounting policies that require more significant estimates and judgments: 
 
 Allowance for loan losses 
 Acquisition of real estate 
 Identified intangible assets and liabilities 
 Impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
 Variable interest entities 
 Fair value of assets and liabilities 
 
 The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments: 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 The Company uses a current expected credit loss model CECL for estimating the provision for loan losses on its loan portfolio. The CECL model requires the consideration of possible credit losses over the life of an instrument and includes a portfolio-based component and an asset-specific component. In compliance with the CECL reporting requirements, the Company supplements its existing credit monitoring and management processes with additional processes to support the calculation of the CECL reserves. The Company engages a third-party service provider to provide market data and a credit loss model. The credit loss model is a forward-looking, econometric, commercial real estate CRE loss forecasting tool. It is comprised of a probability of default PD model and a loss given default LGD model that, layered together with the Company s loan-level data, fair value of collateral, net operating income of collateral, selected forward-looking macroeconomic variables, and pool-level mean loss rates, produces life of loan expected losses EL at the loan and portfolio level. Where management has determined that the credit loss model does not fully capture certain external factors, including portfolio trends or loan-specific factors, a qualitative adjustment to the reserve is recorded. In addition, interest receivable on loans is not included in the Company s CECL calculations as the Company performs timely write offs of aged interest receivable. The Company has made a policy election to write off aged receivables through interest income as opposed to through the CECL provision on its statements of income. 
 
 Loans for which the borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty, and where repayment of the loan is expected substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral, are considered collateral dependent loans. For collateral dependent loans, the Company may elect a practical expedient that allows the Company to measure expected losses based on the difference between the collateral s fair value and the amortized cost basis of the loan. When the repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on a sale, rather than operations of the collateral, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated costs to sell the collateral. If foreclosure is probable, the Company is required to measure for expected losses using this methodology. 
 
 76 

Table of Contents 

 The Company generally will use the direct capitalization rate valuation methodology or the sales comparison approach to estimate the fair value of the collateral for loans and in certain cases will obtain external appraisals. Determining fair value of the collateral may take into account a number of assumptions including, but not limited to, cash flow projections, market capitalization rates, discount rates and data regarding recent comparable sales of similar properties. Such assumptions are generally based on current market conditions and are subject to economic and market uncertainties. 
 
 The Company s loans are typically collateralized by real estate directly or indirectly. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan-by-loan basis. Specifically, a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess: (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future; (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at maturity; and/or (iii) the property s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic submarket in which the collateral property is located. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and underwriting personnel, who utilize various data sources, including: (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrowers business plan, and capitalization and discount rates; (ii) site inspections; and (iii) current credit spreads and other market data and ultimately presented to management for approval. 
 
 When a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and a loan is modified, the effect of the modification will be included in the Company s assessment of the CECL allowance for loan losses. If the Company provides principal forgiveness, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance for loan losses. Generally, when modifying loans, the Company will seek to protect its position by requiring incremental pay downs, additional collateral or guarantees and, in some cases, lookback features or equity interests to offset concessions granted should conditions impacting the loan improve. 
 
 The Company designates a loan as a non-accrual loan generally when: (i) the principal or coupon interest components of loan payments become 90-days past due; or (ii) in the opinion of the Company, recovery of principal and coupon interest is doubtful. Interest income on non-accrual loans in which the Company reasonably expects a recovery of the loan s outstanding principal balance is recognized when received in cash. Otherwise, income recognition will be suspended and any cash received will be applied as a reduction to the amortized cost basis. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status at such time as the loan becomes contractually current and future principal and coupon interest are reasonably assured to be received. A loan will be charged-off when management has determined principal and coupon interest is no longer realizable and deemed non-recoverable. 

The CECL accounting estimate is subject to uncertainty as a result of changing macro-economic market conditions, as well as the vintage and location of the underlying assets as disclosed in Note 3, Mortgage Loan Receivables, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 3.1 million and 7.5 million, respectively, and 13.9 million and 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 52.8 million and 43.9 million, respectively. The allowance includes 0.5 million and 0.7 million of reserves for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimate is sensitive to the assumptions used to represent future expected economic conditions. 

Acquisition of Real Estate 
 
 We generally acquire real estate assets or land and development assets through purchases and may also acquire such assets through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of defaulted loans. Purchased properties are classified as real estate, net or land and development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. When we intend to hold, operate or develop the property for a period of at least 12 months, the asset is classified as real estate, net, and if the asset meets the held-for-sale criteria, the asset is classified as real estate held for sale. Upon purchase, the properties are recorded at cost. Foreclosed assets classified as real estate and land and development are initially recorded at their estimated fair value and assets classified as held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the carrying value of the loan over these amounts is charged-off against the reserve for loan losses. In both cases, upon acquisition, tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their relative fair values. 
 
 Identified Intangible Assets and Liabilities 
 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 We record intangible assets and liabilities acquired at their relative fair values, and determine whether such intangible assets and liabilities have finite or indefinite lives. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all such acquired intangible assets and liabilities have finite lives. We review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable, we will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairments of intangibles are recorded in impairment of assets in our consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets 
 
 Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in real estate held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge. Impairment for real estate assets are included in impairment of assets in our consolidated statements of operations. Once the asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded. 
 
 We periodically review real estate to be held and used, and land and development assets for impairment in value, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The asset s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of real estate and land and development assets are recorded in impairment of assets in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 There were two properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. There were no properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023. We did not record any impairments of real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 
 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 
 We evaluate our investments and other contractual arrangements to determine if our interests constitute variable interests in a variable interest entity VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. There is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary. We first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment, including, but not limited to, which interests create or absorb variability, the contractual terms, the key decision-making powers, impact on the VIE s economic performance and related party relationships. An iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a VIE or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. 
 
 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Distributable Earnings 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company refined its definition of distributable earnings and its descriptions of the adjustments to GAAP income. The refined definition and descriptions do not change how distributable earnings or adjustments to GAAP income are calculated for prior, current or future periods. The Company utilizes distributable earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We believe distributable earnings assists investors in comparing our operating performance and our ability to pay dividends across reporting periods on a more relevant and consistent basis by excluding from GAAP measures certain non-cash expenses and unrealized results as well as eliminating timing differences related to conduit securitization gains and changes in the values of assets and derivatives. In addition, we use distributable earnings: (i) to evaluate our earnings from operations because management believes that it may be a useful performance measure; and (ii) because our board of directors considers distributable earnings in determining the amount of quarterly dividends. In addition, we believe it is useful to present distributable earnings prior to charge-offs of allowance for credit losses to reflect our direct operating results and help existing and potential future holders of our Class A common stock assess the performance of our business excluding such charge-offs. Distributable earnings prior to charge-offs of allowance for credit losses is used as an additional performance metric to consider when declaring our dividends. 
 
 We define distributable earnings as income before taxes adjusted for: (i) net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated ventures; (ii) our share of real estate depreciation, amortization and gain adjustments and (earnings) loss from investments in unconsolidated ventures in excess of distributions received; (iii) the impact of derivative gains and losses related to hedging fair value variability of fixed rate assets caused by interest rate fluctuations and overall portfolio market risk as of the end of the specified accounting period; (iv) economic gains or losses on loan sales, certain of which may not be recognized under GAAP accounting in consolidation for which risk has substantially transferred during the period, as well as the exclusion of the related GAAP economics in subsequent periods; (v) unrealized gains or losses related to our investments in securities recorded at fair value in current period earnings; (vi) unrealized and realized provision for loan losses and real estate impairment; (vii) non-cash stock-based compensation; and (viii) certain non-recurring transactional items. 
 We exclude the effects of our share of real estate depreciation and amortization. Given GAAP gains and losses on sales of real estate include the effects of previously-recognized real estate depreciation and amortization, our adjustment eliminates the portion of the GAAP gain or loss that is derived from depreciation and amortization. 
 
 As discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP and, therefore, any net payments under, or fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives are recognized currently in our income statement. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to hedge exposure to interest rate risk associated with fixed rate mortgage loans, fixed rate securities, and/or overall portfolio market risks. Distributable earnings excludes the GAAP results from derivative activity until the associated mortgage loan or security for which the derivative position is hedging is sold or paid off, or the hedge position for overall portfolio market risk is closed, at which point any gain or loss is recognized in distributable earnings in that period. For derivative activity associated with securities or mortgage loans held for investment, any hedging gain or loss is amortized over the expected life of the underlying asset for distributable earnings. We believe that adjusting for these specifically identified gains and losses associated with hedging positions adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize the gains or losses associated with our assets and the gains and losses associated with derivatives used to hedge such assets. 
 
 We originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized, income producing commercial real estate properties that we intend to sell into third-party CMBS securitizations. Mortgage loans receivable held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market under GAAP. For purposes of distributable earnings, we exclude the impact of unrealized lower of cost or market adjustments on conduit loans held for sale and include the realized gains or losses in distributable earnings in the period when the loan is sold. Our conduit business includes mortgage loans made to third parties and may also include mortgage loans secured by real estate owned in our real estate segment. Such mortgage loans receivable secured by real estate owned in our real estate segment are eliminated in consolidation within our GAAP financial statements until the loans are sold in a third-party securitization. Upon the sale of a loan to a third-party securitization trust (for cash), the related mortgage note payable is recognized on our GAAP financial statements. For purposes of distributable earnings, we include adjustments for economic gains and losses related to the sale of these inter-segment loans for which risk has substantially transferred during the period and exclude the resultant GAAP recognition of amortization of any related premium/discount on such mortgage loans payable recognized in interest expense during the subsequent periods. This adjustment is reflected in distributable earnings when there is a true risk transfer on the mortgage loan sale and settlement. Conversely, if the economic risk was not substantially transferred, no adjustments to net income would be made relating to those transactions for distributable earnings purposes. Management believes recognizing these amounts for distributable earnings purposes in the period of transfer of economic risk is a useful supplemental measure of our performance.

Table of Contents 

As more fully discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we invest in certain securities that are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. For purposes of distributable earnings, we exclude the impact of unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities and include realized gains or losses in connection with any disposition of securities. Distributable earnings includes declines in fair value deemed to be an impairment for GAAP purposes if the decline is determined to be non-recoverable and the loss to be nearly certain to be eventually realized. In those cases, an impairment is included in distributable earnings for the period in which such determination was made. 
 
 We include adjustments for unrealized and realized provision for loan losses and real estate impairment. For purposes of distributable earnings, management recognizes loan and real estate losses as being realized generally in the period in which the asset is sold or the Company determines a decline in value to be non-recoverable and the loss to be nearly certain.

 (b) Prior to the first quarter of 2024, the Company presented these adjustments within Adjustment for economic gain on loan sales not recognized under GAAP for which risk has been substantially transferred, net of reversal/amortization. 
 (3) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss of 3.1 million. In addition, the Company determined a portion of the allowance for loan loss to be non-recoverable and charged-off 5.0 million. 

Distributable earnings has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 Distributable earnings does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations and is not necessarily indicative of cash necessary to fund cash needs; and 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate distributable earnings differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Because of these limitations, distributable earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or any other performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity. 
 
 In addition, distributable earnings should not be considered to be the equivalent to REIT taxable income calculated to determine the minimum amount of dividends the Company is required to distribute to shareholders to maintain REIT status. In order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, we must annually distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income. The Company has declared, and intends to continue declaring, regular quarterly distributions to its shareholders in an amount approximating the REIT s net taxable income. 
 
 In the future, we may incur gains and losses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of distributable earnings should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 For a discussion of current market conditions, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The nature of the Company s business exposes it to market risk arising from changes in interest rates. Changes, both increases and decreases, in the rates the Company is able to charge its borrowers, the yields the Company is able to achieve in its securities investments, and the Company s cost of borrowing directly impacts its net income. The Company s net interest income includes interest from both fixed and floating rate debt. The percentage of the Company s assets and liabilities bearing interest at fixed and floating rates may change over time, and asset composition may differ materially from debt composition. Another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets the Company acquires. The Company faces the risk that the market value of its assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of its liabilities, including its hedging instruments. The Company mitigates interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate futures agreements. Interest rate futures agreements are utilized to hedge against future interest rate increases on the Company s borrowings and potential adverse changes in the value of certain assets that result from interest rate changes. The Company generally seeks to hedge assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in the Company s CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of its U.S. Agency securities portfolio. 
 
 The following table summarizes the change in net income for a 12-month period commencing September 30, 2024 and the change in fair value of our investments and indebtedness assuming an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the relevant benchmark interest rates on September 30, 2024, both adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities in thousands): 
 Projected change in net income(1) Projected change in portfolio value Change in interest rate: Decrease by 1.00 (31,661) 2,897 Increase by 1.00 32,140 (2,682) 
 
 (1) Subject to limits for floors on our floating rate investments and indebtedness. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the market value of the Company s assets may be adversely impacted. 
 
 The Company s securities investments are reflected at their estimated fair value. The change in estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in estimated fair value of Agency interest-only securities is recorded in current period earnings. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase. 
 
 The Company s fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio is subject to the same risks. However, to the extent those loans are classified as held for sale, they are reflected at the lower of cost or market. Otherwise, held for investment mortgage loans are reflected at values equal to the unpaid principal balances net of certain fees, costs and loan loss allowances. 
 
 Concentrations of market risk may exist with respect to the Company s investments. Market risk is a potential loss the Company may incur as a result of change in the fair values of its investments. The Company may also be subject to risk associated with concentrations of investments in geographic regions and industries. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 
 Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which the Company invests and may at the same time lead to a significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in liquidity of real estate and real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 of observable transaction data and inputs, may make it more difficult to sell the Company s investments or determine their fair values. As a result, the Company may be unable to sell its investments, or only be able to sell its investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in such conditions, there is no guarantee that the Company s borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. In addition, a decline in market value of the Company s assets may have particular adverse consequences in instances where it borrowed money based on the fair value of its assets. A decrease in the market value of the Company s assets may result in the lender requiring it to post additional collateral or otherwise sell assets at a time when it may not be in the Company s best interest to do so. The Company s captive insurance company subsidiary, Tuebor, is subject to state regulations which require that dividends may only be made with regulatory approval, limiting the Company s ability to utilize cash held by Tuebor. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 The Company is subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with its investments. The Company seeks to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analyses of potential assets and through ongoing asset management. The Company s investment guidelines do not limit the amount of its equity that may be invested in any type of its assets; however, investments greater than a certain size are subject to approval by the Risk and Underwriting Committee of the board of directors. 
 
 Our portfolio s low weighted average loan-to-value, based on the loan balances and the as-is third-party Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA appraised values at origination, of 66.4 as of September 30, 2024 reflects significant equity value that our sponsors are motivated to protect through periods of cyclical disruption. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. 
 
 Credit Spread Risk 
 
 Credit spread risk is the risk that interest rate spreads between two different financial instruments will change. In general, fixed-rate commercial mortgages and CMBS are priced based on a spread to Treasury or interest rate swaps. The Company generally benefits if credit spreads narrow during the time that it holds a portfolio of mortgage loans or CMBS investments, and the Company may experience losses if credit spreads widen during the time that it holds a portfolio of mortgage loans or CMBS investments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to changes in credit spreads and the Company may enter into credit total return swaps or take positions in other credit-related derivative instruments to moderate its exposure against losses associated with a widening of credit spreads. 
 
 Risks Related to Real Estate 
 
 Real estate and real estate-related assets, including loans and commercial real estate-related securities, are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; environmental conditions; competition from comparable property types or properties; changes in tenant mix or performance and retroactive changes to building or similar codes and rent regulations. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause the Company to suffer losses. 
 
 Covenant Risk 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into loan and securities repurchase agreements and credit facilities with certain lenders to finance its real estate investment transactions. These agreements contain, among other conditions, events of default and various covenants and representations. If such events are not cured by the Company or waived by the lenders, the lenders may decide to curtail or limit extension of credit, and the Company may be forced to repay its advances or loans. In addition, the Company s Notes are subject to covenants, including maintenance of unencumbered assets, limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. The Company s failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which could result in the Company being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. 
 
 We were in compliance with all covenants as described in this Quarterly Report as of September 30, 2024.

 Diversification Risk 
 
 The Company s investments include mortgage loan receivables collateralized by commercial real estate, owned real estate and real estate backed securities. The Company s real estate investments are primarily middle market focused, spread across geographically diverse regions within the United States, and granular in nature with an average loan balance of approximately 25 million to 30 million. The primary assets of the Company are therefore concentrated in the commercial real estate sector, and accordingly, the investment portfolio of the Company may be subject to more rapid change in value than would be the case if the Company were to maintain a wide diversification among investments or industry sectors. Furthermore, even within the commercial real estate sector, the investment portfolio may be relatively concentrated in terms of geography and type of real estate investment. This lack of diversification may subject the investments of the Company to more rapid change in value than would be the case if the assets of the Company were more widely diversified. 
 
 Regulatory Risk 
 
 Tuebor is subject to state regulation as a captive insurance company. If Tuebor fails to comply with regulatory requirements, it could be subject to loss of its licenses and registration and/or economic penalties. 
 
 Effective as of July 16, 2021, LCAM is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended and currently provides investment advisory services solely to Ladder-sponsored collateralized loan obligation trusts CLO Issuers ). The CLO Issuers invest primarily in first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate originated or acquired by Ladder and in participation interests in such loans. LCAM is entitled to receive a management fee connection with the advisory, administrative and monitoring services it performs for the CLO Issuer as the collateral manager; however, LCAM has waived this fee for so long as it or any of its affiliates serves as collateral manager for the CLO Issuers. 
 
 A registered investment adviser is subject to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit its clients. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, record keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, custody arrangements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an investment adviser and its advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In addition, these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our advisory activities in the event we fail to comply with those laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for a failure to comply with applicable legal requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our engaging in various advisory activities for specified periods of time, disgorgement, the revocation of registrations, and other censures and fines. 
 
 We may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens if our investment adviser subsidiary expands its product offerings and investment platform.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. Further, certain of our subsidiaries, such as our registered investment adviser and captive insurance company, are subject to scrutiny by government regulators, which could result in enforcement proceedings or litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. We are not presently a party to any material enforcement proceedings, litigation related to regulatory compliance matters or any other type of material litigation matters. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate, based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards.

 Section 1. Special Meetings .

When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting of stockholders, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. If at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum present, the chair of the meeting or, by a majority in voting power thereof, the stockholders present thereat may, to the extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum shall be present or represented if the date, time, place, if any, and the means of remote communications (including virtually), if any, of the adjourned meeting is announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxy holders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication or set forth in the notice of meeting given in accordance with Section 3 of this Article I.

 Section 4. Chair of Meetings . The Chair of the Board, or in the Chair s absence or at the Chair s direction, the Chief Executive Officer or any other director or officer of the Corporation shall call all meetings of stockholders to order and shall act as chair of any such meetings.

The chair of the meeting shall announce at the meeting when the polls for each matter to be voted upon at the meeting will be opened and closed. After the polls close, no ballots, proxies or votes or any revocations or changes thereto may be accepted. 
 Section 5. Proxies . At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the DGCL, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature or (2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a facsimile or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such facsimile or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the facsimile or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such transmissions are valid, the inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied. 
 A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not 
 2 

irrevocable by attending the meeting to which the proxy relates and voting in person or by timely delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. 
 Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Section 6 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 
 Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the commencement of the meeting to which they relate. 
 Section 6. Voting . When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws or the DGCL a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, these By-Laws or the DGCL a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. 
 Section 7. Record Date. 
 (A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting provided , however , that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting. 
 (B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 Section 8. Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting . At any time when the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation permits action by one or more classes of stockholders of the Corporation to be taken by written consent, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents properly delivered in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, this section and the DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. 
 3 

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 
 Section 9. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare no later than the tenth day before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting provided , however , if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date) showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of ten (10) days ending on the day before the meeting date (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. 
 Section 10. Inspectors . The Board, in advance of all meetings of stockholders, may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but not directors of the Corporation or candidates for election as directors. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chair of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability. Inspectors of stockholder votes shall, subject to the power of the chair of the meeting to open and close the polls, take charge of the polls, and, after the voting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.

 Section 6. Indemnification Not Exclusive. 
 (A) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and costs to any Covered Person under this Article VII, or the entitlement of any Covered Person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article VII, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such Covered Person in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any Covered Person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such Covered Person s capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action in any other capacity.

Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by the indemnitee-related entities and no right of advancement or recovery the Covered Person may have from the indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the Covered Person or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder. In the event that any of the indemnitee-related entities shall make any payment to the Covered Person in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Covered Person against the Corporation, and the Covered Person shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

 (2) The term jointly indemnifiable claims shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for which the Covered Person shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses from both the indemnitee-related entities and the Corporation pursuant to Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of the Corporation or the indemnitee-related entities, as applicable.

The right of any Covered Person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to indemnification or advancement of expenses as provided under the foregoing provisions of this Article VII shall continue after such Covered Person shall have ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributees, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such Covered Person. 
 Section 10. Insurance .
