FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report, including, without limitation, statements
under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains
forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Undue reliance should not
be placed on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations,
estimates and projections about Wellings Real Estate Income Fund (the Fund ), current and prospective portfolio investments,
industry, beliefs and the Fund s assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, 
 plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, 
 would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these
words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Fund s control and difficult to predict
and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including: 

business prospects and the prospects of the Fund s
 portfolio companies; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions,
 the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets; 

the ability of Wellings Capital Management, LLC (the
 Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for the Fund and to monitor and administer the Fund s investments; 

the ability of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates
 to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

risk associated with possible disruptions in the Fund s
 operations or the economy generally; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations
 of the companies in which the Fund invests; 

the ability of the companies in which the Fund invests
 to achieve their objectives; 

the dependence of the Fund s future success on
 the general economy and its effect on the industries in which the Fund invests; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of the
 Fund s investments; 

the adequacy, availability and pricing of the Fund s
 financing sources and working capital; 

actual or potential conflicts of interest with the
 Investment Adviser and its affiliates; 

contractual arrangements and relationships with third
 parties; 

the economic downturn, interest rate volatility, loss
 of key personnel, and the illiquid nature of investments; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified
 under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report. 

Although the Fund believes that the assumptions on
which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result,
the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time,
and it is not possible for the Fund to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can the Fund assess the impact of all factors on the Fund s
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement
in this Report should not be regarded as a representation that the Fund s plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and
uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this
Report. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Report. Moreover,
the Fund assumes no duty and does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements.

Subscriptions will be effective only upon the Fund s acceptance, and the Fund reserves the right to reject any subscription in whole

with the requirement contained under Section 23 of the 1940 Act. The Board (including any committee thereof) may set the per-share price
above the net asset value per share based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, to ensure that investors acquiring Shares

In addition, at the discretion of the Board, the
Fund may provide liquidity to investors by one or more Liquidity Events. A Liquidity Event means, at the discretion of the
Board a sale of all or substantially all of the Fund s assets. However, since the Fund expects that many of the operators and managers
of the entities that constitute the Targeted Assets may determine to liquidate the Targeted Assets prior to a contemplated Liquidity Event
of the Fund, no sale of all or substantially all of the Targeted Assets may be necessary to return investors investments. The Fund
will only consider a Liquidity Event if the terms of such Liquidity Event will be in the Fund s investors best interests.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking
information that involves risks and uncertainties. The discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

The Fund is a closed-end management investment company that has elected
its fiscal year end to be March 31 and to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund invests in a variety of commercial real estate asset classes, including, but not limited to, manufactured housing
communities, self-storage facilities, RV parks, multifamily, and small-bay industrial properties through investments in limited liability
companies LLCs or limited partnerships LPs ). The operators within these asset classes primarily focus on
value-add opportunities to increase net operating income, which is then passed on to the investors through free cash flow from operations.
The investment adviser for the Fund is Wellings Capital Management, LLC the Adviser ). 

The Fund was seeded on March 30, 2022, with an initial capital contribution
of 200,000. For the period from April 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022, the Fund s Adviser managed the Fund s registration
and organizational readiness processes and incurred organizational and offering costs, respectively, on behalf of the Fund. The organizational
and offering costs are subject to reimbursement by the Fund, and the Fund was required to begin reimbursing the Adviser upon reaching
 20.0 million in investor subscriptions, which was achieved during the year ended March 31, 2023. 

Business proceedings and operations officially commenced on July 1, 2022,
and the first fiscal year end was March 31, 2023. The Fund is now in its third year of operations. For the three and six months ended
September 30, 2024, the Fund raised approximately 7.16 million and 11.99 million, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund generated 1,031,358
from fee income and dividend income from the Fund s underlying investments in certain LLCs and LPs and 222,626 in interest income,
totaling 1,253,984 for the period. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund generated 1,954,964
from fee income and dividend income from the Fund s underlying investments in certain LLCs and LPs and 372,222 in interest income,
totaling 2,327,186 for the period. 

Key Components of Operations 

Investments 

The Fund s level of investment activity can and does vary substantially
from period to period depending on many factors, including the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available,
and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying
assets specified in the Investment Company Act of 1940 unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets
are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies 
include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities
are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 

For existing investments, the Adviser monitors the financial trends of
each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course
of action for each company. In addition, our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair
value of our investments, which may include (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance
with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor
to discuss the financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry,
if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and
quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 

17 

Investment Income 

As of September 30, 2024, the Fund s portfolio consisted of 24 common
and preferred equity commercial real estate investments, which are expected to generate stable and consistent cash flow over the long
term. The Fund generates revenues in the form of distributions that we receive from the LLC and LP interests that we own. Distribution
amounts are determined entirely by the Managing Members/General Partners of those entities and allocated to us based on our proportionate
interest in those investments. Distributions we receive are analyzed to determine the amount of the distribution that represents income
or return of capital based on the financial information reported to us by the Operator of the underlying investment. 

During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund generated
 1,253,984 and 2,327,186, respectively, in income, coming from fee income, dividend income, and interest income. This is primarily derived
from cash flow distributions from the fund s underlying investments. The interest income came as a result of the fund s short-term
investments in money-market accounts. The Adviser believes that the Fund will continue to generate income during each quarter of the Fund s
operations. 

Expenses 

The Fund s primary operating expenses include the payment of the
audit expense, management fee to the Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest expenses, valuation services, and other operating
expenses. These expenses are incurred in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement and are necessary to ensure the proper functioning
and management of the Fund. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating,
closing, and monitoring our investments. The Fund bears all other expenses of its operations and transactions, including operational expenses,
fees and expenses related to investments and prospective investments, brokers commissions, legal, auditing or accounting expenses,
taxes or governmental fees, officers and directors expenses, marketing expenses, valuation expenses, filing expenses, and the fees
and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase
in the aggregate and decrease as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to decrease in the aggregate and increase
as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines. Additionally, costs relating to future offerings of securities would
be incremental. 

Investment Activity 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund made two new
investments and three follow-on investments across varying opportunities, bringing the total to 24 total investments since the Fund s
inception. This brought the total invested since inception to 52.64 million. In addition, for the three months and six months ended September
30, 2024, the Fund raised approximately 7.16 million and 11.99 million, respectively, which was used to support the new investments
and increase the Fund s liquidity, bringing the total capital contributions to approximately 68.47 million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund made three new
investments and one follow-on investment across varying opportunities, bringing the total to 20 total investments since the Fund s
inception. This brought the total invested since inception to 37.74 million. In addition, for the three and six months ended September
30, 2023, the Fund raised approximately 4.74 million and 15.64 million, respectively, which was used to support the new investments
and increase the Fund s liquidity, bringing the total capital contributions to 43.91 million. 

Details regarding the acquisition costs, investment type, and representative
percentage of the Fund s total net assets can be found in the Schedule of Investments and notes to the financial statements
included in this filing. 

Result of Operations 

It is important to note that this is the Fund s ninth quarter of
operations and tenth since launch, and as such, the Fund s performance should be considered in the context of its early stage of
development.

investments and fee income. The Fund generated Net Investment Income of 685,730 and 348,729 for the three months ended September

cash flow being provided from the Fund s investments.

for preparing the prospectus and statement of additional information in connection with the Fund s registration and public offering.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had 19.01 million in short-term investments.
The investments are liquidated into cash for investing and general corporate purposes at the discretion of management. We believe we have
adequate capital resources to meet our liquidity needs. 

The Fund s cash used in operating activities was 11.04 million and
 15.22 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the Fund s cash provided by financing activities
was 11.04 million and 15.17 million for the same periods. The Fund s operating activities used cash primarily for the Fund s
investment activities and the Fund s financing activities provided cash primarily due to proceeds from shares
issued. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund closed offerings
at the beginning of each calendar month, raising 11.99 million in cash that was available for the Adviser to invest in qualified investments.
The Fund intends to continue to invest available capital in accordance with its investment strategy. The Adviser believes that the Fund
has adequate liquid assets to meet any and all obligations that arise while continuing to make opportunistic investments. 

Equity 

The Fund officially began accepting capital contributions on July 1, 2022.
From inception to September 30, 2024, the Fund has received total capital contributions of 68.37 million in equity, and the Adviser anticipates
this number to continue growing for the foreseeable future. 

The Fund has made cash distributions of 942,751 to investors during
the six months ended September 30, 2024. Cash available for distributions was generated from the Fund s underlying
investments. These distributions are at the sole discretion of the Adviser.

1, 2024 and November 1, 2024, respectively. The Fund distributed additional cash of 295,186 as a return on capital to investors on October
31, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.
Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results
to differ materially. 

The Fund s critical accounting estimates are as follows: 

Investment Valuations 

The valuation of the Fund s investments is determined as of the close
of business at the end of each reporting period, generally quarterly. The board of trustees (the Board is responsible for
overseeing the Fund s valuation policies, making recommendations to the Adviser on valuation-related matters, and overseeing implementation
by the Adviser of such valuation policies. 

The Board has delegated day-to-day management of the valuation process
to the Adviser as the appointed valuation designee Valuation Designee ). The Adviser has established a valuation committee
(the Adviser Valuation Committee to carry out this function. The Valuation Designee is subject to the oversight of the
Board. The Valuation Designee is responsible for assessing and managing key valuation risk, and is generally responsible for the review,
approval and testing of valuation methodologies and the determination of the fair value of the Fund s investments. 

22 

The Fund applies FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ),
as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and requires disclosures of fair value
measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the
principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to
transact. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination
of fair value. 

The valuation policies approved by the Board provide that, where deemed
appropriate by the Adviser and consistent with the 1940 Act, investments may be valued at cost. Cost would be used only when cost is determined
to best approximate the fair value of the particular investment under consideration. For example, cost may not be appropriate when the
Fund is aware of sales of similar securities to third parties at different prices or in other circumstances where cost may not approximate
fair value (which could include situations where there are no sales to third parties). In such a situation, the Fund s investment
will be revalued in a manner that the Adviser Valuation Committee, in accordance with the valuation procedures, determines in good faith
best reflects fair value. Valuation methodologies which may be utilized include the public market methodology, private market methodology,
analytical methodology (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis), and/or cost methodology. 

The inputs used to determine the fair value of the Fund s investments
are summarized in the three broad levels listed in the fair value hierarchy below: 

Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
investments and registered investment companies where the value per share (unit) is determined and published and is the basis for current
transactions for identical assets or liabilities at the valuation date. 

Level 2 investments with other significant observable inputs (including
quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, benchmark yields, bids, offers, transactions, spreads, cash collateral, and other
relationships observed in the markets among market securities, underlying equity of the issuer, proprietary pricing models, credit risk,
etc.); or 

Level 3 investments with significant unobservable inputs (which may
include the Fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments) 

A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy
is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Excluding the Fund s Level 1 short-term
investments in overnight accounts, all of the Fund s investments are classified as Level 3 or are valued using net asset value as
practical expedient. 

23 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Fund is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest
rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in the Fund s earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest
rates. Because the Fund expects to fund a portion of its investments with borrowings, its net investment income is expected to be affected
by the difference between the rate at which the Fund invests and the rate at which it borrows. As a result, there can be no assurance
that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund s net investment income. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Fund s management, under the direction, supervision, and involvement
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this
report, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) of the Fund. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures in place at the Fund are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Fund s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Fund s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure
controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). 

24 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser or Administrator
is currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to the Fund s knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened
against the Fund, or against the Investment Adviser or Administrator. 

From time to time, the Fund, the Investment Adviser,
or the Administrator may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to
the enforcement of the Fund s rights under contracts with the Fund s portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Fund does not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon the Fund s
financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in
this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A of the Fund s Form 10-K
(File No. 000-56432), which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in
the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

On October and November 1, the Fund sold 625,000
and 775,000, respectively, aggregating approximately 71 million of unregistered common shares of beneficial interest to accredited investors.
For the period from April 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024, the Fund made investments in three different commercial real estate opportunities
spread across various parts of the United States totaling approximately 3.00 million. See the Financial Statements and Management s
