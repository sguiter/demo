Overview 

As a leadership team we are optimistic and excited about our opportunities to carve out very profitable positions in the marketplace through our patent-pending Methylene Blue products along with our additional specialty product offerings. The market opportunities we are targeting includes: Dementia and Alzheimer s disease, ADHD and ADD, Long Covid, General Energy, Traumatic Brain Injury, Mild Cognitive Decline, GLP-1 Weight Loss, Sleep Improvement, Epilepsy and Seizure Reduction and Nasal Health and Allergy.

Methylene Blue and specialty natural options has emerged as valuable foundational health options on these fronts. We believe we are very well positioned and with adequate capital infusion we will be able to capitalize on multiple market opportunities. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering

The Nowtransit management team plans to focus on gaining traction for its mental health and general wellness products. Best 365 Labs, Inc has filed for a provisional patent on its mental wellness, natural products which is an additional reason we plan to focus and grow this sector of the products. With the Global Mental Health Marketplace currently valued at 383.31 billion annually and with 41 million people holding a prescription for Adderall that the market conditions are idea for us to offer our natural substitute product options (which are also unique). 

As a leadership team we are optimistic and excited about our opportunities to carve out very profitable positions in these potential marketplaces, through our patent-pending Methylene Blue products along with our additional specialty product offerings. The market opportunities we are targeting include: 

1. Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: The global market for dementia and Alzheimer's disease treatment and care is substantial, with estimates ranging from tens to hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This includes spending on medications, long-term care, home care services, assistive devices, and research efforts aimed at finding effective treatments and interventions. 

2. ADHD and ADD: The market for ADHD and ADD treatment encompasses a wide range of products and services, including prescription medications, therapy services, educational resources, and dietary supplements. In the United States alone, spending on ADHD medications exceeds several billion dollars annually, with additional expenditures on other forms of treatment and support. 

3. Long Covid: Long Covid is a relatively new condition, and the market size for treatments and support services is still emerging. However, healthcare spending related to Covid-19, including both acute care and long-term management of post-Covid symptoms, is substantial and continues to grow as the pandemic persists. 

4. General Energy: The market for products and services aimed at boosting energy levels is vast and includes a wide range of offerings, such as energy drinks, dietary supplements, nutritional products, fitness programs, and wellness services. Globally, this market is worth billions of dollars annually and continues to expand as consumers seek ways to enhance their energy and vitality. 

5. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): The market for TBI treatment and rehabilitation encompasses various healthcare services, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and assistive technologies. Estimates of the economic burden of TBI vary widely, but it is recognized as a significant public health issue with substantial costs associated with medical care, long-term disability, and lost productivity. 

6. Mild Cognitive Decline: The market for products and services targeting mild cognitive decline, such as cognitive training programs, dietary supplements, and brain health assessments, is growing as awareness of cognitive health issues increases. While precise market size estimates may be challenging to obtain, the demand for interventions to support cognitive function in aging populations is driving growth in this sector. 

7. GLP-1 Weight Loss Market: The global market for GLP-1 agonists used for weight loss is significant and continues to expand. According to market research reports, the global GLP-1 agonists market was valued at several billion dollars in recent years, and it is projected to continue growing at a steady rate. 

8. Sleep Improvement/Sleep Health: The global sleep market is substantial and continues to grow. According to various market research reports, the global sleep aids market was valued at several billion dollars in recent years, and it is projected to continue expanding at a steady rate. This growth is driven by factors such as increasing awareness of the importance of sleep for overall health and well-being, rising prevalence of sleep disorders, and the availability of a wide range of sleep products and services. 

9. Epilepsy and Seizure Reduction: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting millions of people globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, making it a significant public health concern. The high prevalence of epilepsy creates a substantial market for products and services aimed at reducing seizures and improving quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. 

10. Nasal Health and Allergy: This market includes pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medications, nasal sprays, nasal irrigation devices, allergy testing kits, allergy immunotherapy, and more. According to various market research reports, the global nasal drug delivery technology market was valued at over 50 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. Factors driving growth include increasing prevalence of allergic rhinitis and other nasal disorders, technological advancements in drug delivery systems, growing demand for over-the-counter allergy medications, and rising awareness about nasal health.

Obstacles to carve out space in these categories include access to adequate capital to carve out the profitable market niche and segments. We believe we have a medical advisory team established (that a much larger company would be proud of); a leadership team that has innovated an initial suite of products (portions of which are patent pending) and a sales and marketing team that is already starting to gain traction. 

A trend that we believe is very beneficial and encouraging is the recent growing interest in mitochondria health and the role that mitochondria dysfunction plays in mental health and physical health issues. 

Methylene Blue and specialty natural options has emerged as valuable foundational health options on these fronts. We believe we are very well positioned and with adequate capital infusion we will be able to capitalize on multiple market opportunities. 

To establish our position in the emerging methylene blue marketplace and the many options and market segments we have put together a very strong and diverse medical advisory team to advise, innovate/refine innovations, educate and develop protocols to promote optimal mitochondria and overall mental and physical health. 

Our Sales Plan and Channels 

The plan is to commercialize and become a market leader within the Methylene Blue along with our specialty immune, nasal and allergy support categories. 

Currently we have started sales in the following categories: 

1. 

Amazon: We are currently selling all six products listed above at Amazon. The plan is to continue building this sales channel. We view this as an essential sales channel especially for credibility, and market acceptance. 

2. 

Wholesale Sales: We have developed an online platform at https://best365labswholesale.com to facilitate clinics, Dr s, chiropractors, and other wholesalers to easily order our products. Through tradeshows we have already onboarded 700 clients to this portal. Sales are growing monthly and showing potential. 

3. 

Private Label Sales: We currently have three deals in place. We are being very selective on who we allow to private labels and it has to fit within a market category above that makes sense within our overall vision and growth. 

4. 

Direct Sales: We are revising our online platform at www.Best365Labs.com to capitalize better on SEO and Google ads. That being said sales are showing promise on this front. 

With adequate capital infusion we can look at additional sales channels including traditional retail sales that require terms of 30-90 days. Currently our wholesale clients are paying for their products in advance. We are also moving forward on establishing international distribution opportunities. 

We believe that the market for our patent pending methylene blue and specialty products will continue to expand and grow causing an organic a natural growth cycle to occur.

Patent Pending Product Overview and Update 

New U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/560,474 for METHYLTHIONINIUM SALT-CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS 

The above-referenced provisional patent application was filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("Patent Office") on March 1, 2024. This was filed for the Company by law firm, Thorpe North and Western. 

This provisional application does not constitute a regular utility patent application which could issue as a U.S. patent. It is merely a provisional (or temporary) filing which gives us a filing date and protects us from loss of patent rights arising from a public sale, publication or public use of the invention which would bar obtaining valid patent protection. By filing this provisional application, we have now secured a filing date. 

We believe that there are multiple potential patents within this offering. Leadership is exploring potential partnerships and strategic alliances to monetize and capitalize for the stakeholder. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Going Concern 

Our business is subject to risks inherent in marketing products in a competitive market as we continue to sell clinically-tested, affordably priced products to naturally battle the onslaught of bacteria and viruses through online sales and in various other distribution channels. Presently, the Company is marketing Be On-Guard Mouth Spray, Be On-Guard Nasal Spray, EZ, Safer Surface Cleaner, Be On-Guard Brain Fog Support and ADHD 365 maximum strength brain support, while also having limited capital resources and expecting possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. 

As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has generated revenues resulting in a net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is showing total assets in excess of total liabilities as of September 30, 2024. However, in the past the Company has reported losses and cash used in operating activities, thus resulting in an accumulated deficit of 351,040 as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, over time the Company has relied on advances from related parties and proceeds from the sale of stock, therefore has not yet developed a proven track record of profitability. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is engaged in full-scale operations as a distributor and generates revenue however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company s daily operations long-term. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ), the Company s management evaluated, with participation of its principal executive officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The material weaknesses identified during management s assessment were (i) a lack of sufficient internal accounting resources; (ii) a lack of segregation of duties to ensure adequate review of financial statement preparation, (iii) lack of an independent board of directors or audit committee, and (iv) lack of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. In light of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at the Evaluation Date. We plan to rectify these weaknesses by establishing written policies and procedures for our internal control of financial reporting and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we raise sufficient capital to do so. There were no changes in controls during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
