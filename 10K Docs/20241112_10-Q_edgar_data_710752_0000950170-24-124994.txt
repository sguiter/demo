SABINE ROYALTY TRUST PART I FIN ANCIAL INFORMATION It em 1. Financial Statements. The condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by Argent Trust Company, as trustee (the Trustee of Sabine Royalty Trust (the Trust ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Trustee believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The condensed financial statements of the Trust presented herein are unaudited. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements and notes thereto be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust s latest annual report on Form 10-K. The December 31, 2023 condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus is derived from the audited statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus as of that date. In the opinion of the Trustee, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Trust as of September 30, 2024, and the distributable income and the changes in trust corpus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been included. The distributable income for such interim periods is not necessarily indicative of the distributable income for the full year. Unless specified otherwise, all amounts included herein are presented in US dollars. The condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included herein, have been reviewed by Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Holders of Sabine Royalty Trust and Argent Trust Company, Trustee Dallas, Texas Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying condensed statements of assets, liabilities and trust corpus of Sabine Royalty Trust (the Trust) as of September 30, 2024, and the related condensed statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed interim financial statements or interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As described in Note 2 to the condensed interim financial statements, these condensed interim financial statements were prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the statement of assets, liabilities, and trust corpus as of December 31, 2023, and the related statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 29, 2024 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the statement of assets, liabilities, and trust corpus from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These condensed interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Trustee. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. WEAVER AND TIDWELL, L.L.P. Dallas, Texas November 12, 2024

NOTES TO COND ENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. TRUST ORGANIZATION AND PROVISIONS Sabine Royalty Trust (the Trust was established by the Sabine Corporation Royalty Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement ), made and entered into effective as of December 31, 1982, to receive a distribution from Sabine Corporation Sabine of royalty and mineral interests, including landowner s royalties, overriding royalty interests, minerals (other than executive rights, bonuses and delay rentals), production payments and any other similar, nonparticipator interests (the Royalties ), in certain producing and proved undeveloped oil and gas properties located in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas (the Royalty Properties ). Certificates evidencing units of beneficial interest (the Units in the Trust were mailed on December 31, 1982, to Sabine s shareholders of record on December 23, 1982, on the basis of one Unit for each share of Sabine s outstanding common stock. In May 1988, Sabine was acquired by Pacific Enterprises. Through a series of mergers, Sabine was merged into Pacific Enterprises Oil Company (USA) Pacific (USA) ), which in turn was merged and consolidated into Sempra Energy, effective January 1, 1993. As of August 1, 2006, Sempra Energy sold its various interests and rights to Providence Energy Corporation PEC ). PEC in turn transferred its interests and rights to RJ Holdings, Inc. RJ Holdings as of June 1, 2021. These transactions had no effect on the Units. RJ Holdings, as successor to Sabine, has assumed by operation of law all of Sabine s rights and obligations with respect to the Trust. The Units are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the transfer of the Royalties to the Trust upon its formation, Sabine had reserved to itself all executive rights, including rights to execute leases and to receive bonuses and delay rentals. Through a series of mergers, Sabine was merged into Pacific (USA), which in turn was merged and consolidated into Sempra Energy, effective January 1, 1993. In January 1993, Pacific (USA) completed the sale of substantially all of Pacific (USA) s producing oil and gas assets to Hunt Oil Company. The sale did not include executive rights relating to the Royalty Properties, and Pacific (USA) s ownership of such rights was not affected by the sale. The Trustee currently reviews all leases executed on the Trust s behalf. The wells on the properties conveyed to the Trust are operated by many companies including large, established companies such as BP Amoco, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil. The Trustee believes these operators utilize the recovery methods best suited for the particular formations on which the properties are located. Argent Trust Company (the Trustee ), acts as trustee of the Trust. The terms of the Trust Agreement provide, among other things, that: The Trust shall not engage in any business or commercial activity of any kind or acquire assets other than those initially transferred to the Trust. 

 The Trustee may not sell all or any part of its assets unless approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Units in which case the sale must be for cash and the proceeds, after satisfying all existing liabilities, promptly distributed to Unit holders. 

 The Trustee may establish a cash reserve for the payment of any liability that is contingent or uncertain in amount or that otherwise is not currently due or payable. 

 The Trustee will use reasonable efforts to cause the Trust and the Unit holders to recognize income and expenses on monthly record dates. 

 The Trustee is authorized to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust provided that such borrowings are repaid in full before any further distributions are made to Unit holders. 

 The Trustee will make monthly cash distributions to Unit holders of record on the monthly record date (see Note 3). 

 Effective October 19, 2017, Simmons First National Corporation SFNC completed its acquisition of First Texas BHC, Inc., the parent company of Southwest Bank. SFNC is the parent of Simmons Bank. SFNC merged Southwest Bank with Simmons Bank effective February 20, 2018. On November 4, 2021, Simmons Bank, as trustee, announced that it had entered into an agreement with Argent Trust Company, a Tennessee chartered trust company Argent ), pursuant to which Simmons Bank would be resigning as trustee of the Trust and would nominate Argent as successor trustee of the Trust. Simmons Bank s resignation as trustee, and Argent s appointment as successor trustee, became effective December 30, 2022. The defined term Trustee as used herein shall refer to Southwest Bank for periods from May 30, 2014 through February 19, 2018, shall refer to Simmons Bank for periods on and after February 20, 2018 through December 29, 2022, and shall refer to Argent for periods on and after December 30, 2022. Because of the passive nature of the Trust and the restrictions and limitations on the powers and activities of the Trustee contained in the Trust Agreement, the Trustee does not consider any of the officers and employees of the Trustee to be officers or executive officers of the Trust as such terms are defined under applicable rules and regulations adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proceeds of production from the Royalty Properties are receivable from hundreds of separate payors. In order to facilitate creation of the Trust and to avoid the administrative expense and inconvenience of daily reporting to Unit holders, the conveyances by Sabine of the Royalties

Table of Contents 

located in five of the six states provided for the execution of an escrow agreement by Sabine and the initial trustee of the Trust, in its capacities as trustee of the Trust and as escrow agent. The conveyances by Sabine of the Royalties located in Louisiana provided for the execution of a substantially identical escrow agreement by Sabine and a Louisiana bank in the capacities of escrow agent and of trustee under the name of Sabine Louisiana Royalty Trust. Sabine Louisiana Royalty Trust, the sole beneficiary of which is the Trust, was established in order to avoid uncertainty under Louisiana law as to the legality of the Trustee s holding record title to the Royalties located in Louisiana. The Trust now only has one escrow agent, which is the Trustee, and a single escrow agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement and the conveyances of the properties by Sabine, the proceeds of production from the Royalty Properties for each calendar month, and interest thereon, are collected by the Trustee, as escrow agent, and are paid to and received by the Trust only on the next monthly record date. The Trustee, as escrow agent, has agreed to endeavor to assure that it incurs and pays expenses and fees for each calendar month only on the next monthly record date. The Trust Agreement also provides that the Trustee is to endeavor to assure that income of the Trust will be accrued and received and expenses of the Trust will be incurred and paid only on each monthly record date. Assuming that the escrow agreement is recognized for federal income tax purposes and that the Trustee is able to control the timing of income and expenses, as stated above, cash and accrual basis Unit holders should be treated as realizing income only on each monthly record date. The Trustee is treating the escrow agreement as effective for federal income tax purposes. However, for financial reporting purposes, royalty and interest income are recorded in the calendar month in which the amounts are received by either the escrow agent or the Trust. Distributable income as determined for financial reporting purposes for a given quarter will not usually equal the sum of distributions made during that quarter. Distributable income for a given quarter will approximate the sum of the distributions made during the last two months of such quarter and the first month of the next quarter. 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The condensed financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ): Royalty income, net of severance and ad valorem taxes, and interest income are recognized in the month in which amounts are received by the Trust, pending verification of ownership and title. 

 Trust expenses, consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs, include payments made during the accounting period. Expenses are accrued to the extent of amounts that become payable on the next monthly record date following the end of an accounting period. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary. 

 Royalties that are producing properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method. This amortization is shown as a reduction of Trust corpus. 

 Distributions to Unit holders are recognized when declared by the Trustee (see Note 3). 

 The condensed financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America because of the following: Royalty income is recognized in the month received, pending verification of ownership and title, rather than in the month of production. 

 Expenses other than those expected to be paid on the following monthly record date are not accrued. 

 Amortization of the Royalties is shown as a reduction to Trust corpus and not as a charge to operating results. 

 Reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the basis of accounting described above requires the Trustee to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, income, and expenses as of and for the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from such estimates. 

 11 

Table of Contents 

Distributable Income per Unit Basic distributable income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and equivalent Units outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period presented. Therefore, basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the same. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on the Trust s financial statements. Federal Tax Considerations The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that the Trust is classified as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, and therefore, is not subject to federal income tax at the trust level. The Unit holders are considered, for federal income tax purposes, to own the Trust s income and principal as though no trust were in existence. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax expense has been made in these financial statements. The income of the Trust will be deemed to have been received or accrued by each Unit holder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust (on the applicable monthly record date) if the escrow arrangement discussed in Note 1 to these financial statements is respected by the Internal Revenue Service. In the absence of the escrow arrangement, Unit holders would be deemed to receive or accrue income from production from the Royalty Properties (and interest income) on a daily basis, in accordance with their method of accounting, as the proceeds from production and interest thereon were received or accrued by the Trust. The Trustee is treating the escrow arrangement as effective for federal income tax purposes and furnishes tax information to Unit holders on that basis. State Tax Considerations The Trust holds properties located in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Unit holders should consult the Trust s latest annual report on Form 10-K for a summary of tax matters. Florida does not impose an individual income tax. Florida imposes an income tax on resident and nonresident corporations (except for S corporations not subject to the built-in-gains tax or passive investment income tax), which will apply to royalty income allocable to a corporate Unit holder from properties located within Florida. Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma each impose an income tax applicable to both resident and nonresident individuals and/or corporations (subject to certain exceptions for S corporations and limited liability companies, depending on their treatment for federal tax purposes), which will apply to royalty income allocable to a Unit holder from properties located within these states. New Mexico and Oklahoma impose a withholding tax on payments to nonresidents of oil and gas proceeds derived from royalty interests. To reduce the administrative burden imposed by these rules, the Trustee has opted to allow the payors of oil and gas proceeds to withhold on royalty payments made to the Trust. The Trust files New Mexico tax returns, obtains a refund, and distributes that refund to Unit holders. Unit holders who transfer their Units before the New Mexico tax refunds are received by the Trust or after the refunds are received but before the next monthly record date will not receive any portion of the refund. As a result, such Unit holders may effectively incur a double tax first, through the reduced distribution received from the Trust (as withholding at the Trust level reduces the amount of cash available for distribution) and second, by the tax payment made directly to New Mexico taxing authorities with the filing of their New Mexico income tax returns. The Trust may qualify for an exemption from Oklahoma withholding tax and is currently in the process of requesting exemptions from payors of oil and gas proceeds in Oklahoma. If the Trust is unable to successfully obtain Oklahoma withholding tax exemptions or obtain a refund on behalf of the Unit holders, Unit holders will be required to file an Oklahoma income tax return to claim a refund (to the extent available to the Unit holder) for any amounts withheld from royalty payments made to the Trust. A Unit holder s entitlement to a refund will be dependent upon the relevant facts and circumstances of each Unit Holder. Texas does not impose an individual income tax. Texas imposes a franchise tax at a rate of 0.75 on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas franchise tax statutes. Entities subject to the Texas franchise tax generally include trusts and most other types of entities that provide limited liability protection, unless otherwise exempt. Trusts that receive at least 90 of their federal gross income from certain passive sources, including royalties from mineral properties and other non-operated mineral interest income, and do not receive more than 10 of their income from operating an active trade or business generally are exempt from the Texas franchise tax as passive entities. The Trust has been and expects to continue to be exempt from Texas franchise tax as a passive entity. Because the Trust should be exempt from Texas franchise tax at the Trust level as a passive entity, each Unit holder that is a taxable entity under the Texas franchise tax generally will be required to include its portion of Trust revenues in its own Texas franchise tax computation. This revenue is sourced to Texas under provisions of the Texas Administrative Code providing that such income is sourced according to the principal place of business of the Trust, which is Texas. Unit holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the possible state tax implications of owning Trust Units. 3. DISTRIBUTION TO UNIT HOLDERS The amount to be distributed to Unit holders Monthly Income Amount is determined on a monthly basis. The Monthly Income Amount is an amount equal to the sum of cash received by the Trust during a monthly period (the period commencing on the day after a monthly record date and continuing through and including the next succeeding monthly record date) attributable to the Royalties, any reduction in cash reserves and any other cash receipts of the Trust, including interest, reduced by the sum of liabilities paid and any increase in cash reserves. Due to the fact that oil and 

 12 

Table of Contents 

natural gas prices have been unusually volatile in recent history, the Trustee maintains an expense reserve. The expense reserve was established to allow the Trustee to pay general and administrative expenses even if there were not sufficient funds generated from monthly royalty income to pay such expenses. Unit holders of record as of the monthly record date (the 15th day of each calendar month except in limited circumstances) are entitled to have distributed to them the calculated Monthly Income Amount for such month on or before 10 business days after the monthly record date. The Monthly Income Amount per Unit is declared by the Trust no later than 10 days prior to the monthly record date. The cash received by the Trust from purchasers of the Trust s oil and gas production consists of gross sales of production less applicable severance taxes and ad valorem taxes.. 4. PAYABLES Payables consist primarily of royalty receipts suspended pending verification of ownership interest or title, as well as amounts the Trustee has reserved for payments of other expenses. The Trustee believes that these payables represent an ordinary operating condition of the Trust and that such payables will be paid or released in the normal course of business with the exception of amounts reserved for payment of expenses. 5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Trust declared the following distributions:

6. CONTINGENCIES Contingencies related to the Royalty Properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future royalty income payments to the Trust with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders. The Trustee is not aware of any such items as of September 30, 2024.

Ite m 2. Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Trust makes monthly distributions to the holders of Units of the excess of the preceding month s royalty income received over expenses incurred. Upon receipt, royalty income is invested in short-term investments until its subsequent distribution. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust s only long-term assets consist of royalty interests in producing and proved undeveloped oil and gas properties. Although the Trust is permitted to borrow funds if necessary to continue its operations, borrowings are not anticipated in the foreseeable future. Commodity Prices The Trust s income and monthly distributions are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, (ii) market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Trustee s control. The price of oil and natural gas continued to remain soft from the first quarter through the beginning of the third quarter in 2023 due to continued lower demand resulting from higher-than-normal inflation and an oversupply of the commodities. In the latter part of the third quarter of 2023, the price of oil and gas began to increase, due mainly to OPEC cutting oil production and colder weather during the winter. Oil prices have continued to fluctuate during the first nine months of 2024, due mainly to weather conditions and geopolitical conditions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Factors which may affect commodity prices are discussed below and under Item 1A Risk Factors in the Trust s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, include but are not limited to: political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, and Israel and Iran; 

 worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions; 

 weather conditions; 

 trade barriers; 

 public health concerns; 

 the supply and price of domestic and foreign crude oil or natural gas; 

 the level of consumer demand; 

 the price and availability of alternative fuels; 

 the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities; 

 the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental policies and regulatory incentives for investment in non-fossil fuel energy sources; and 

 the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation. 

 Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, gas royalty income for a given period generally relates to production three months prior to the period and crude oil royalty income for a given period generally relates to production two months prior to the period and will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production at the time of production. When crude oil and natural gas prices decline, the Trust is affected in two ways. First, distributable income from the Royalty Properties is reduced. Second, exploration and development activity by operators on the Royalty Properties may decline as some projects may become uneconomic and are either delayed or eliminated. It is impossible to predict future crude oil and natural gas price movements, and this reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to Unit holders. Results of Operations Distributable income consists of royalty income plus interest income plus any decrease in cash reserves established by the Trustee less general and administrative expenses of the Trust less any increase in cash reserves established by the Trustee. Distributable income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 19,070,466, or 1.31 per unit. Royalty income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to 19,784,478 while interest income was 145,868. General and administrative expenses totaled 859,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Distributions during the period were 0.379040, 0.450890, and 0.421310 per Unit payable to Unit holders of record on July 15, August 15, and September 16, 2024, respectively. Royalty income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased approximately 5,419,000, or 38 , compared with the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in both oil and natural gas production 6.3 million) and in oil prices 0.8 million), partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices 1.3 million) and increased production taxes, operating expenses, and ad valorem taxes 0.4 million).

Compared to the preceding quarter ended June 30, 2024, royalty income decreased approximately 2,823,000, or 12 , due mainly to decreased oil and natural gas production 1.1 million), and lower oil and natural gas prices 2.1 million). These decreases to royalty income were partially offset by lower production taxes, operating expenses, and ad valorem taxes 0.4 million). Royalty income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased approximately 4,217,000, or 7 , compared to the same 2023 period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in both oil and natural gas production 15.8 million) and an increase in oil prices 2.0 million). This increase was tempered by a decrease in the price of natural gas 12.6 million) and higher production taxes, operating expenses, and ad valorem taxes 1.0 million). The following tables illustrate average prices received for the periods discussed above and the related oil and gas production volume:

Oil royalty income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to production for May through July 2024. The average price of oil reported by NYMEX for the May through July 2024 period was 80.57 per barrel. The average price of oil was 78.58 per barrel for January through September 2024. Gas royalty income received for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to production for April through June 2024. The average price of gas reported by the Henry Hub for the April through June 2024 period was 1.86 per thousand cubic feet Mcf ). The average price of gas reported by the Henry Hub was 1.90 per Mcf for January through September 2024. As of October 28, 2024, the average price of oil reported by NYMEX was 67.65 per barrel and the average price of gas for the Henry Hub was 1.83 per Mcf. It is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas, and any assumptions concerning future prices may prove to be incorrect. Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 16,900 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the preceding quarter ended June 30, 2024, interest income decreased 29,500. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased approximately 57,500 compared to the same period in 2023. Changes in interest income are the result of changes in interest rates and funds available for investment. General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased approximately 93,700 compared to the same quarter of 2023 due primarily to the timing of payment of unitholder services of approximately 80,000 and professional services of approximately 40,000. These were offset by a decrease in printing services of approximately 30,000, and approximately 3,000 in other miscellaneous expenses. Compared to the previous quarter ended June 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 156,400 primarily due to the timing of payment of unitholder services of approximately 80,000, an increase in professional services of approximately 79,200, an increase in Escrow Agent/Trustee fees of approximately 43,200, and an increase in revenue processing fees of approximately 68,400, partially offset by a decrease in printing fees due to the timing of payment of services of approximately 112,000, and approximately 2,400 in other miscellaneous expenses, General and administrative expenses decreased approximately 209,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to a decrease in Escrow Agent fees of approximately 236,000, offset by an increase in CDEX account services of 27,000. The condensed financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America because of the following: Royalty income is recognized in the month received, pending verification of ownership and title, rather than in the month of production. 

 Expenses other than those expected to be paid on the following monthly record date are not accrued.

Amortization of the Royalties is shown as a reduction to Trust corpus and not as a charge to operating results. 

 Reserves may be established for contingencies that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A disclosure of critical accounting policies and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Trust s financial statements is included in Item 7 of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Distributable Income per Unit Basic distributable income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and equivalent Units outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period presented. Therefore, basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the same. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on the Trust s financial statements. Forward Looking Statements This Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements. Although the Trustee believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and the Trustee can give no assurance that they will prove correct. There are many factors, none of which are within the Trustee s control, that may cause such expectations not to be realized, including, among other things, factors identified in the Trust s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K affecting oil and gas prices and the recoverability of reserves, general economic conditions, actions and policies of petroleum-producing nations and other changes in the domestic and international energy markets. The Trust has an Internet website and has made available its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act at http://www.sbr-sabine.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such information is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Trust invests in no derivative financial instruments and has no foreign operations or long-term debt instruments. Other than the Trust s ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses, liabilities and obligations of the Trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the Trust, the Trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions. The amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the Trust. The Trust periodically holds short-term investments acquired with funds held by the Trust pending distribution to Unit holders and funds held in reserve for the payment of Trust expenses and liabilities. Because of the short-term nature of these borrowings and investments and certain limitations upon the types of such investments which may be held by the Trust, the Trustee believes that the Trust is not subject to any material interest rate risk. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Trustee concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There has not been any change in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO issued an updated version of its Internal Control Integrated Framework (the 2013 Framework ). Originally, issued in 1992 (the 1992 Framework ), the framework helps organizations design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify their use and application. The Trustee has

transitioned fully to the Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 and is utilizing this framework in its evaluation of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
