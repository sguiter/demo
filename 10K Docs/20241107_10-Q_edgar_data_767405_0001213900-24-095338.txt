in cash in exchange for each share of Marblehead Bancorp common stock for a transaction valued
in aggregate at approximately million. 

When finalized, the merger will add two full-service
branches and one limited-service branch to State Bank s branch footprint, strengthening State Bank s position in the Northwest
Ohio region and expanding State Bank s presence into the Marblehead, Ohio and Ottawa County, Ohio communities. 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SBFG, State Bank, RFCBC, RDSI, RMC, SBFG Title, SB Captive and SBI (collectively,
the Company ). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The financial statements reflect all adjustments
that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company. Those adjustments consist only of normal recurring adjustments. Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of results for the complete year. 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of that date. 

For
further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The
fair value of securities pledged as collateral, to secure public deposits and for other purposes, was million at September 30,
2024, and million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of securities delivered for repurchase agreements was million at September
30, 2024, and million at December 31, 2023. 

There
were no realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
or September 30, 2023. 

Certain
investments in debt securities are reported in the consolidated financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. Total
fair value of these investments was million at September 30, 2024, and million at December 31, 2023, which consisted of
 securities, or approximately percent, and securities, or approximately percent, respectively, of the Company s available-for-sale
investment portfolio at such dates. Based on evaluation of available evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates, credit
rating information and information obtained from regulatory filings, management believes the declines in fair value for these securities
are temporary.

Based
on evaluation of available evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates, credit rating information and information obtained
from regulatory filings, management believes the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary. Management reviews these
securities on a quarterly basis and evaluates if any security has a fair value less than its amortized cost. Once these securities are
identified, management determines whether a decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors. In making the assessment,
the Company may consider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, performance on any underlying
collateral, downgrades in the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal
payments and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, a provision
is recorded to the ACL. 

Changes
in the ACL are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Available-for-sale securities are charged-off against the allowance
or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned
criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no ACL on available-for-sale securities
was recorded. 

Management has made the accounting policy election
to exclude accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable
on available-for-sale debt securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Should the decline
in fair value be the result of credit losses or other factors, the security would be moved to nonaccrual status and all accrued interest
reversed.

The totals
shown above are net of deferred loan fees and costs, which totaled million and million at September 30, 2024, and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

The risk
characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: 

Commercial
 Industrial and Agricultural 

Commercial
 industrial loans and agricultural loans are primarily underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily
on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral
securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets,
such as accounts receivable or inventory, and may include a personal guarantee. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In
the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent
on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

Commercial
Real Estate (Owner and Nonowner Occupied) 

Commercial
real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending
typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation
of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more
adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of properties securing the
Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely in the Company s market
area. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In general,
the Company avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. In addition,
management tracks the level of owner-occupied versus non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. 

Construction
loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews and financial analysis of the developers and property
owners. Construction loans are generally underwritten based on estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These
estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent
on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved
long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained.
These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to
their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions
and the availability of long-term financing. 

Residential
Real Estate, HELOC and Consumer 

Residential
and consumer loans consist of two segments residential mortgage loans and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans are secured
by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner-occupied, and the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires
private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. HELOCs are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences,
and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer personal
loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on
the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels.
Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that these loans
are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers. 

11 

million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

The
Company measures expected credit losses for loans on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has identified
the following portfolio segments: 

Commercial
 Industrial - Commercial industrial loans consist of loans or lines of credit
 to finance accounts receivable, inventory or other general business needs, and lease financing
 agreements for equipment, vehicles, or other assets. The primary risk associated with commercial
 industrial loans and lease financing agreements is the ability of borrowers to achieve
 business results consistent with those projected at origination. Failure to achieve these
 projections presents risk the borrower will be unable to service the debt consistent with
 the contractual terms of the loan or lease. 

Commercial
 Real Estate - Owner Occupied - Owner occupied commercial real estate loans consist of
 loans to purchase or re-finance owner occupied nonresidential properties. This includes office
 buildings and other commercial facilities. Commercial mortgages secured by owner occupied
 properties are primarily dependent on the ability of borrowers to achieve business results
 consistent with those projected at loan origination. While these loans are collateralized
 by real property in an effort to mitigate risk, it is possible the liquidation of collateral
 will not fully satisfy the obligation as the commercial real estate collateral may be more
 adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. 

Commercial
 Real Estate Nonowner Occupied - Nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans
 consist of loans to purchase, construct, or refinance investment nonresidential properties.
 This includes office buildings and other facilities rented or leased to unrelated parties,
 as well as multifamily properties. The primary risk associated with nonowner occupied commercial
 real estate loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the
 loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. While these loans are collateralized
 by real property in an effort to mitigate risk, it is possible the liquidation of collateral
 will not fully satisfy the obligation as the commercial real estate collateral may be more
 adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. 

Agricultural
 - Agricultural loans consist of loans or lines of credit to finance farmland, equipment,
 and general business needs or other assets. The primary risk associated with agricultural
 loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected
 at origination. Failure to achieve these projections presents risk the borrower will be unable
 to service the debt consistent with the contractual terms of the loan.

Collateral
dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral
and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The Company reviews individually evaluated loans for designation as collateral
dependent loans, as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk. These loans do not share common
risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the ACL.

and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. This
analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass
(grades 1 4): Loans which management has determined to be performing as expected and in agreement with the terms established
at the time of loan origination. 

Special
Mention (5): Loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential
weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company s credit position at some future
date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
Ordinarily, special mention credits have characteristics which corrective management action would remedy. 

Substandard
(6): Loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged,
if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized
by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful
(7): Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable
and improbable. 

Loss
(8): Loans are considered uncollectable and of such little value that continuing to carry them as assets on the Company s financial
statement is not warranted. Loans will be classified as Loss when it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off or reserving
all or a portion of a basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be possible at some time in the future.

Modifications
made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

In
the normal course of business, the Company may execute loan modifications with borrowers. These modifications are analyzed to determine
whether the modification is considered concessionary, long term and made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The Company s
modifications generally include interest rate adjustments, principal reductions, and amortization and maturity date extensions. These
modifications allow the borrowers short-term cash relief to allow them to improve their financial condition. If a loan modification is
determined to be made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan is considered collateral dependent and evaluated as part
of the ACL as described above in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company did not modify any loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

The
Company had no commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company had modified an existing loan
as of September 30, 2024. The Company monitors loan payments on an ongoing basis to determine if a loan is considered to have a payment
default. Determination of payment default involves analyzing the economic conditions that exist for each customer and its ability to
generate positive cash flows during the loan term. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no loan modifications
made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within the 12 months following the modification
date.

million. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated
for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may
exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than
not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment
are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing
a qualitative assessment. 

Goodwill
was assessed for impairment using a quantitative test performed as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit
exceeded the net carrying value, and therefore no goodwill impairment existed as of that date. No events or circumstances since the September
30, 2024, impairment test were noted that would indicate it was more likely than not a goodwill impairment exists.

Change in fair value 

Balance at end of period 

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and
recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation
hierarchy. 

Collateral-dependent
Individually evaluated Loans, Net of ACL 

The
estimated fair value of collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans is based on the appraised value of the collateral, less estimated
cost to sell. Collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. This method
requires obtaining an independent appraisal of the collateral, which is reviewed for accuracy and consistency by management. Appraisers
are selected from an approved list which is maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by applying a discount factor
to the value based on the Company s loan review policy. All individually evaluated loans held by the Company were collateral dependent
at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023. 

Mortgage
Servicing Rights 

Mortgage
servicing rights do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using discounted
cash flow models associated with the servicing rights and discounting the cash flows using discount market rates, prepayment speeds and
default rates. The servicing portfolio has been valued using all relevant positive and negative cash flows including servicing fees;
miscellaneous income and float; marginal costs of servicing; the cost of carry of advances; and foreclosure losses; and applying certain
prevailing assumptions used in the marketplace. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, mortgage servicing rights are classified within
Level 3 of the hierarchy.

There
were no changes in the inputs or methodologies used to determine fair value at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. 

The
following methods were used to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets at amounts other than fair value. 

Cash
and Due From Banks, Interest Bearing Time Deposits, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock, and Accrued Interest Receivable
and Payable 

The carrying
amount approximates the fair value. 

Loans
Held for Sale 

The
fair value of loans held for sale is based upon quoted market prices, where available, or is determined by discounting estimated cash
flows using interest rates approximating the Company s current origination rates for similar loans and adjusted to reflect the
inherent credit risk. 

Loans 

The
estimated fair value of loans follows the guidance in ASU 2016-01, which prescribes an exit price approach in estimating
and disclosing fair value of financial instruments. The exit price is determined based on discounted estimated future cash
flows using rates that incorporate discounts for credit, liquidity, and marketability factors.

common shares of the Company are available for grants or awards under the 2017 Plan, of which shares had been
granted under the plan as of September 30, 2024. 

The
2017 Plan is intended to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by offering employees, directors and advisory board
members of the Company and its subsidiaries an opportunity to acquire or increase their ownership interest in the Company through grants
of equity-based awards. The 2017 Plan permits equity-based awards to be used to attract, motivate, reward and retain highly competent
individuals upon whose judgment, initiative, leadership and efforts are key to the success of the Company by encouraging those individuals
to become shareholders of the Company. 

Stock
option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant and those
option awards vest based on five years of continuous service and have contractual terms. The fair value of each option award
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. As of September 30, 2024, there were no stock options outstanding,
and no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards. No stock options were granted in the first nine months of 2024. 

On
February 5, 2013, the Company adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTI Plan ), which provides for awards of restricted

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023, describes the significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of the Company s financial statements.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company s financial position and results of operations
can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding of reported results. Critical accounting policies
are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results,
and they require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective, and/or complex. 

Allowance
for Credit Losses The Company believes the determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of judgment
and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining
a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses over the life of an asset or an off-balance
sheet credit exposure. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations
of past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the
financial assets. However, this evaluation has subjective components requiring material estimates, including expected default probabilities,
the expected loss given default LGD ), the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans,
and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and forecasted economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible
to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may
be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. 

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles - The Company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill
and other intangibles, at fair value as required. Goodwill is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Other intangible
assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line or accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events
or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. The initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and
subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform
in the future. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, customer attrition, changes in revenue
growth trends, specific industry conditions and changes in competition. A decrease in earnings resulting from these or other factors
could lead to an impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.

up 50.7 million or 3.8 percent since December 31, 2023. Total loans, net of unearned income, were 1.03 billion as of September 30, 2024,

 80.2 million at September 30, 2024. This is down from year-end 2023 when borrowed funds totaled 126.9 million due to the paydown of

quality through the first nine months of 2024, with the non-performing asset ratio at 40 basis points and coverage on non-performing

Capital
Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, based on the computations for the FFIEC 041 Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income filed by State Bank with
the Federal Reserve Board, State Bank was classified as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. To be categorized as well capitalized, State Bank must maintain capital ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no
conditions or events since September 30, 2024, that management believes have changed State Bank s capital classification. The Company
adopted CECL on January 1, 2023, which reduced capital levels by 2.0 million. The Company elected to not phase in the impact of CECL
as the reduction in capital did not have a material impact to tangible and regulatory capital levels. 

State
Bank s actual capital levels and ratios as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are presented in the following table.
Capital levels are presented for State Bank only as the Company is exempt from quarterly reporting on capital levels at the holding company

Regulatory
capital requirements commonly referred to as Basel III were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, and are reflected in
the capital table above. Management opted out of the accumulated other comprehensive income treatment under the new requirements and,
as such, unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities will continue to be excluded from State Bank s regulatory
capital. 

38 

Liquidity 

Liquidity
relates primarily to the Company s ability to fund loan demand, meet deposit customers withdrawal requirements and provide
for operating expenses. Assets used to satisfy these needs consist of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-earning deposits
in other financial institutions, securities available-for-sale and loans held for sale. These assets are commonly referred to as liquid
assets. Liquid assets totaled 271.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 246.7 million at December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity
risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet the Company s financial obligations and operating cash
needs or may become overly reliant upon external funding sources. In order to manage this risk, the Board of Directors of the Company
has established a Liquidity Policy that identifies primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring
liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements. This policy designates the Asset/Liability Committee ALCO as
the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO reviews liquidity regularly and evaluates significant changes in strategies
that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed on a daily basis by the Company s Chief Financial
Officer and Asset Liability Manager. 

The
Company s commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family mortgage portfolio of 838.3 million
at September 30, 2024, and 807.8 million at December 31, 2023, which can and has been used to collateralize borrowings, is an additional
source of liquidity. Management believes the Company s current liquidity level, without these borrowings, is sufficient to meet
its liquidity needs. At September 30, 2024, all eligible commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family
mortgage loans were pledged under an FHLB blanket lien. 

The
cash flow statements for the periods presented provide an indication of the Company s sources and uses of cash, as well as an indication
of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. A discussion of the cash flow statements for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 follows. 

The
Company experienced positive cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.

months ended September 30, 2023. Highlights for the current year include 153.7 million in proceeds from the sale of loans, which is
up 25.9 million from the prior year. Originations of loans held for sale was a use of cash of 158.3 million, which is up 31.1 million
from the prior year . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a gain on sale of loans of 3.5 million, and depreciation
and amortization on premises and equipment of 1.6 million. 

The
Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.
Net cash used in investing activities was 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 10.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Highlights for the current year include an increase of 29.8 million in loans, which is up 2.7 million
from the prior year nine-month period. These cash payments were offset by 14.1 million in proceeds from maturities and sales of securities,
which is down 2.9 million from the prior year nine-month period. 

The
Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and negative cash flows
from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities was 37.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash used in financing activities was 5.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Highlights for the current period include a 79.8 million increase in transaction deposits and a 9.6 million increase in time
deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to the prior year nine-month period where transaction deposits decreased
by 54.2 million and time deposits increased by 52.9 million. Net repayments of Federal Home Loan Bank advances for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, were 48.6 million, compared to 0.5 million for the prior year nine-month period. 

Off-Balance-Sheet
Borrowing Arrangements: 

Significant
additional off-balance-sheet liquidity is available in the form of FHLB advances and unused federal funds lines from correspondent banks.
Management expects the risk of changes in off-balance-sheet arrangements to be immaterial to earnings. 

The
Company s commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family mortgage portfolios in the total amount
of 838.3 million were pledged to meet FHLB collateralization requirements as of September 30, 2024. Based on the current collateralization
requirements of the FHLB, the Company had approximately 136.9 million of additional borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024. The Company
also had 63.6 million in unpledged securities available to pledge for additional borrowings. 

The
Company has contractual obligations consisting of long-term debt obligations and operating lease obligations. In addition, as of September
30, 2024, the Company had commitments to sell mortgage loans totaling 16.9 million. The Company believes that it has adequate resources
to fund commitments as they arise and that it can adjust the rate on savings and time deposits to retain deposits in changing interest
rate environments. If the Company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati and other
financial institutions are available.

Asset
Liability Management 

Asset
liability management involves developing, executing and monitoring strategies to maintain appropriate liquidity, maximize net interest
income and minimize the impact that significant fluctuations in market interest rates would have on current and future earnings. The
business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans,
mortgage-backed securities, and securities available for sale) which are primarily funded by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and
borrowings). With the exception of specific loans which are originated and held for sale, all of the financial instruments of the Company
are for other than trading purposes. All of the Company s transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars with no specific foreign
exchange exposure. In addition, the Company has limited exposure to commodity prices related to agricultural loans. The impact of changes
in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on interest rates are assumed to be insignificant. The Company s financial instruments
have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates resulting in market risk. Interest rate risk is the Company s
primary market risk exposure; to a lesser extent, liquidity risk also impacts market risk exposure. 

Interest
rate risk is the exposure of a banking institution s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting
this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose
a significant threat to the Company s earnings and capital base. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest
rate risks at prudent levels is essential to the Company s safety and soundness. 

Evaluating
a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process
used to control interest rate risk and the organization s quantitative level of exposure. When assessing the interest rate risk
management process, the Company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems and internal controls
are in place to maintain interest rate risks at prudent levels of consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest
rate risk exposure requires the Company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated
financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity and asset quality (when appropriate). 

The
Federal Reserve Board together with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted
a Joint Agency Policy Statement on Interest Rate Risk effective June 26, 1996. The policy statement provides guidance to examiners and
bankers on sound practices for managing interest rate risk, which will form the basis for ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of interest
rate risk management at supervised institutions. The policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have
been identified in prior Federal Reserve Board guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing interest
rate risk. Specifically, the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive
risk management process that effectively identifies, measures and controls interest rate risk. 

Financial
institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of interest an institution
earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Since market interest rates
change over time, an institution is exposed to lower profit margins (or losses) if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes. For example,
assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate or long-term fixed rates and that those assets are funded with short-term
liabilities. If market interest rates rise by the time the short-term liabilities must be refinanced, the increase in the institution s
interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the long-term fixed rates. Accordingly,
an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will either have lower net interest income or
possibly, net interest expense. Similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest rate ceilings, or rate-sensitive
assets are funded by longer-term, fixed-rate liabilities in a declining rate environment. 

There
are several ways an institution can manage interest rate risk including: 1) matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities,
for example, by shortening or lengthening terms of new loans, investments, or liabilities; 2) selling existing assets or repaying certain
liabilities; and 3) hedging existing assets, liabilities, or anticipated transactions. An institution might also invest in more complex
financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps, futures contracts, options on futures
contracts, and other such derivative financial instruments can be used for this purpose. Because these instruments are sensitive to interest
rate changes, they require management s expertise to be effective. The Company does not currently utilize any derivative financial
instruments to manage interest rate risk. As market conditions warrant, the Company may implement various interest rate risk management
strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

With
the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and the Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer) of the Company, the Company s management has evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based
on that evaluation, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that: 

information
required to be disclosed by the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports which the Company files or submits under

principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; 

information
required to be disclosed by the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports which the Company files or submits under
the Exchange Act would be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms; and 

the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
