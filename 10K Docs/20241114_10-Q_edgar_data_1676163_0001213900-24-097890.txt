EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

On
May 3, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC entered an order barring BF Borgers CPA PC Borgers ),
the Company s then independent registered public accounting firm, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.
As a result, Borgers could no longer act as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm and effective May 13, 2024,
the Company dismissed Borgers as its independent registered public accounting firm and reported the dismissal in a Current Report on
Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 13, 2024. 

Effective
May 29, 2024, the Company engaged BDO India LLP BDO as the Company s new independent registered public accounting
firm and reported the engagement in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2024. 

Given
the circumstances giving rise to Borgers dismissal, the Company asked BDO to reaudit SSi s financial statements as of and
for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which were included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023, (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Contemporaneously with the reaudit, the Company also undertook
an internal review of certain accounting policies and internal controls and procedures. 

In a subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K (the August Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024, the Company reported that in the course of this internal review and while BDO is performing the
reaudit, various matters detailed in the August form 8-K, which were deemed to be material to the audited financial statements included
in the 2023 Form 10-K came to the attention of our board of directors. As a result, the Company reported in the August Form 8-K, that
SSi s board of directors determined that the Company s (i) audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023
and December 31, 2022 included in the 2023 Form 10-K; and (ii) interim unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended March 31,
2023, June 30. 2023, September 30, 2023 and March 31. 2024 contained in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods would need
to be restated and could not be relied upon. 

The
reaudit of the Company s financial statements has not as yet been completed and accordingly, no amendments to the previously filed
Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q giving effect to the restated financial statements have been filed. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to comply with current information
requirements of the Over-the-Counter Market, the Company is filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2024 (this Report ), without an audited restated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and without the required
auditor review of the unaudited interim financial statements contained herein. The Company will amend this Report as soon as practicable
after the audit and required review are completed and to the extent required will include any necessary adjustments or restatements for
the periods presented. Further if at any time prior to filing the amendment to this Report, the Company determines that the interim unaudited
financial statements included in this Report may not be relied upon, it will disclose the same in a Current Report on Form 8-K.

TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

. Effective November 5, 2015, the Company s corporate name was changed to Avra
Medical Robotics, Inc. The Company was established and is continuing to develop advanced medical and surgical robotic systems. 

On
April 14, 2023, AVRA-SSI Merger corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with Cardio Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation CardioVentures ), which is the indirect parent of Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt. Ltd., an Indian private limited
company engaged in the business of developing innovative surgical robotic technologies. As a result of such a transaction, a change
in control of the Company took place. In addition, among other matters, the Company changed its name to SS Innovations
International, Inc. and implemented a reverse stock split. The financial statements, financial information and
share and per share information contained in this report reflect the operations of the newly formed merged entity and Cardio Ventures
and give actual effect to the reverse stock split. 

The
significant accounting policies of SSII were described in Note 1 to the audited financial statements included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There has been an internal review and revision of some of the Company s
accounting policies retrospectively and accordingly some of the financial statement balances as of December 31, 2023 are restated while
for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, the revised accounting policies have been applied. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S.
GAAP ). The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and reflect the financial statements
of SS Innovations International, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. 

The
standalone financial statements of subsidiaries are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Intra-group balances and transactions,
and gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated while preparing consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting
policies of the respective individual subsidiaries are aligned wherever necessary, so as to ensure consistency with the accounting policies
that are adopted by the Company under U.S. GAAP. 

In
the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all the adjustments
necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the quarterly period ended September
30,2024, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period.

and an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The Company incurred a net loss of for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30,2024 

The
Company launched the commercial sale of its SSI Mantra surgical robotic system in India in the last quarter of 2022 and
sold three systems in 2022. During the year ended 2023, the Company sold 12 more surgical robotic systems which included its first export
sale to Dubai, UAE and also installed 4 systems on pay-per-use basis. 

During
the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company has further sold 25 systems (including three systems exported, one each
to Nepal, Indonesia and Ecuador) and installed another system on revenue share basis in a leading training robotic training center in
India. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 40 systems and has installed 5 systems on pay-per-use/revenue share basis. During
the same period as above, there has also been an intra-group sale of one system which has been exported by SSI India to its parent company,
SSII USA and the same system is being currently utilized for demonstration purposes only and not for any clinical use in USA. For the
purpose of reporting consolidated financial statements, this intra-group sale of one surgical robotic system and 2 systems which were
invoiced towards the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, but were in transit have also been eliminated from the revenues from
sale of systems. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had two systems installed at two of the prominent hospital chains in India
for clinical evaluation purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an overall network of 47 systems including 2 systems which
were in transit to their respective hospitals. 

As
of September 30, 2024, a total of 2,129 surgical robotic procedures have been successfully completed in India on the surgical robotic
systems installed by the Company with Urology and General surgery procedures constituting almost of the total procedures and also
included 125 cardiac surgeries. There has been a consistent increase in system utilization resulting in gradual increase in recurring
revenues from the sale of surgical robotic instruments and allied accessories. As the installed base of Company s surgical robotic
systems increases in the coming years, these recurring revenues are also likely to grow further. 

In
order to augment its working capital resources to keep its production and its sales momentum going, during the nine months period ended
September 30, 2024, the Company has raised short term funds to the extent of Million which comprise of US Million through
issuances of One-year Convertible Promissory Notes CPNs to five investors including US Million from Sushruta Pvt
Ltd. SPL ), the Bahamian holding company owned by Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
principal shareholder. The principal amount of these CPNs along with accrued interest @ p.a. thereon would be repayable one year from
the date of their respective issuances. The CPN holders also have the option to convert these CPNs into common shares of the Company
at US per share any time prior to their respective maturity dates. 

During
April 2024 and July 2024, the Company also raised an additional US Million and US respectively Million through One-Year Promissory
Notes issued to SPL. These One-Year Promissory Notes are not convertible and mature for payment of principal with interest on their

In February 2024, the Company raised million through a private offering
of One-Year Convertible Promissory Notes (the 7 Notes from two affiliates each), including Sushruta
Pvt Ltd. Sushruta and from three other investors to finance its ongoing working capital requirements.
The 7 Notes are payable in full after 12 months from the respective dates of issuance of these 7 Notes and are convertible at the election

2. In April 2024, an ex-shareholder of Otto commenced litigation in the Bahamas, seeking legal confirmation that it holds shares (approximately a interest) in Otto. The litigation, in which Otto is one of the defendants, relates to a purported transaction in 2021, at which time Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and principal shareholder, was the sole shareholder of Otto. The plaintiff in the litigation alleges that at that time, it acquired the Otto shares from Dr. Srivastava. However, as the plaintiff failed to pay the agreed upon consideration for the shares, in July 2022, the shareholding was cancelled. Dr. Srivastava has recently filed an action in the Bahamas to confirm the cancellation of the shares and reconfirm their ownership and both actions are pending in the Bahamian courts. The Bahamian court has issued an interim order to maintain the status quo as it stands today with respect to the Otto shares at the center of the dispute, as well as Otto s shareholdings in SSI-India and SSI-India s assets during the pendency of the litigation. Based on legal opinions obtained from counsel, the Company believes that there will be a favorable outcome in this case. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dr. Srivastava
and the Company have entered into an Indemnification Agreement on October 12, 2024, pursuant to which Dr. Srivastava has agreed to fully
indemnify the Company for any claims, damages and costs (including legal fees) which it incurs in connection with this litigation or in
relation to any of his ventures prior to consummation of the CardioVentures Merger in April 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

We are a commercial-stage surgical robotics company
focused on transforming patient lives by democratizing access to advanced surgical robotics technologies at relatively affordable costs. 

We design, manufacture and market an advanced,
next-generation and affordable surgical robotic system called the SSi Mantra and its allied instruments and accessories. 

While surgical robotic systems have gained acceptance
globally in the past two decades for providing greater efficiency, better clinical outcomes and reducing healthcare costs, access to such
systems remains largely limited to developed countries such as the United States, the European Union and Japan. Lower levels of surgical
robotic penetration outside these territories have been largely attributed to high capital costs and operating expenses coupled with steep
learning curve. 

With the SSi Mantra, we are aiming to break down
these barriers and accelerate access to surgical robotics technologies in underserved regions of the world. 

We are constantly working on making our surgical robotics technology more
user-friendly, easy to operate and cost effective so as to make its benefits reach larger communities across the globe. We are relentlessly
pursuing our vision of increasing the penetration of robotics surgeries in regions and countries which were hitherto completely forgotten.
In this pursuit, we recently set up the first surgical robotic system in the Himalayan nation, Nepal in one of the leading multi-specialty
hospitals which has generated tremendous interest in other hospitals also in the region. 

The SSi Mantra Surgical Robotic System has received regulatory approvals
in India, Indonesia, Nepal, Guatemala and Ecuador. We are at various stages of the regulatory registration process in a number of other
countries which accept Indian regulatory body approvals coupled with their own registration requirements for the import of surgical robotic
systems into these countries. We have initiated the regulatory approval process in the United States and the EU, with approvals
to market anticipated in the latter part of 2025. 

Results of Operations 

Introduction 

The financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. In the second half of 2022, the Company commercially launched its SSi
Mantra surgical robotic system in India and during the third quarter of 2024, launched an updated version of the system, the
SSi Mantra 3. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 40 systems (including one system as intra-group sale). In addition, we have also
installed five systems on a pay-per-use/revenue share basis and two systems are installed in two hospitals in India for clinical evaluation.
The intra-group sale system, though eliminated from consolidated revenues of the Company, is currently installed in a rented space in
New York for demonstration purposes. As of September 30, 2024, in excess of 2,000 robotic surgical procedures of various types involving
varying degrees of complexities have been performed on our SSi Mantra systems installed in India. General surgery and urology constitute
almost 70 of these surgical procedures, while 125 cardiac procedures have also been successfully performed using the SSi Mantra.

The Company has been consistently making efforts
to raise debt and equity capital to keep its operational growth momentum going and meet the demands of further scaling up its growing
operations. To date, the Company has relied on debt and equity raised in private offerings and shareholder loans to finance operations
and no other sources of capital has been identified. If we experience a shortfall in operating capital, we could face slower revenue growth
and slower expansion plans. 

Three months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues. We had revenues of 3,408,706
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,779,602 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company sold
seven surgical robotic systems during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research and Development Expenses. Research
and development expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,300,241, as compared to 293,086 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries paid to engineers. The increase in the research and
development expenses from the 2023 quarter to the 2024 quarter, reflects the Company s continued focus on improving the design and
technological capabilities of its existing SSi Mantra system, leading to the launch of the SSi Mantra 3 during the third quarter of 2024
and further expansion of our product offerings. 

Stock Compensation Expense. We had stock
compensation expenses of 3,337,465 and nil for three months ended
September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the stock compensation expense from the 2023 quarter to
the 2024 quarter, is primarily the result of the award of stock grants to employees of the Company s subsidiaries and the issuance
of stock awards and stock options to executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries in November 2023 under our Incentive Stock
Plan, in recognition of their efforts in developing and commercializing our SSi Mantra Surgical Robotic System. 

Depreciation and amortization expense. We
had depreciation and amortization expense of 865,942 for three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 39,746 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization expenses
primarily consist of depreciation on fixed assets, software, and licenses, as well as the amortization of security deposits and prepaid
stock compensation expense. 

General and Administrative Expenses. We
incurred 1,735,098 in general and administrative expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 453,114 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. Our general and administrative G A expenses are comprised of expenses
relating to salaries and benefits, retirement benefits as well as costs related to recruitment, training and retention of senior management
and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs
G A expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs of third party legal,
tax, accounting, immigration and other advisors), investment in product development, digital technology, advanced automation and robotics,
related to grant of our equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our G A expenses to increase as we continue
to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management and training programs. 

24 

Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist
of salaries and benefits, retirement benefits and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel,
sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue
to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding. The increase in
G A expenses resulted from the increased scale of commercial operations during the 2024 quarter, as compared to the 2023 quarter. 

Other Income/Expense . We incurred net
other income/expense of 183,312 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 452,518 during the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Other expense consisted mainly of interest expenses related to bank overdraft and other income consisted primarily
of interest earned on fixed deposits (offered as security against certain working capital facilities obtained from HDFC bank in India)
and finance component in sales on deferred payment basis, due to application of ASC606. The reduction in (net) other income/expense as
reflected above was mainly due to increased incidence of recognition of finance component in sales on a deferred payment basis. 

Net Loss. We incurred a net loss of 6,119,381
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 1,222,340 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This increase in net loss is mainly attributable to the increase in stock compensation expenses described above. 

Nine months ended September 30,2024, as compared
to nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues. We had revenues of 15,025,717
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,866,287 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 25 surgical robotic systems and installed one system in a leading robotic training institute
in India on a revenue share basis. 

Research and Development Expenses. Research
and development expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,726,359, as compared to 781,817 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries paid to engineers. The increase in the research and development
expenses from the 2023 period to the 2024 period, reflects the Company s continued focus on improving the design and technological
capabilities of its existing SSi Mantra system, leading to the launch of the SSi Mantra 3 during the third quarter of 2024 and further
expansion of our product offerings. 

Stock Compensation Expense. We had stock
compensation expenses of 6,586,381 and nil for nine months ended September
30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The substantial increase in the stock compensation expense from the 2023 period to
the 2024 period, year is primarily the result of the award of stock grants to employees of the Company s subsidiaries and the issuance
of stock awards and stock options to executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries in November 2023 under our Incentive Stock
Plan, in recognition of their efforts in developing and commercializing our SSi Mantra Surgical Robotic System. 

Depreciation and amortization expense. We
had depreciation and amortization expense of 1035,861 for nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 110,663 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The depreciation and amortization expenses
primarily consist of depreciation on fixed assets, software, and licenses, as well as the amortization of security deposits and prepaid
stock compensation expense. 

General and Administrative Expenses. We
incurred 7,418,541 in G A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,293,479 for the nine months ended September
30,2023. Our G A expenses is comprised of expenses relating to salaries and benefits, retirement benefits as well as costs related
to recruitment, training and retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities,
travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs G A expenses also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees
(which represent the costs of third party legal, tax, accounting, immigration and other advisors), investment in product development,
digital technology, advanced automation and robotics, related to grant of our equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect
our G A expenses to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development,
performance management and training programs. 

25 

Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist
of salaries and benefits, retirement benefits and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel,
sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue
to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding. 

The increase in G A expenses from the 2023
period to the 2024 period, resulted from the increased scale of commercial operations during 2024 as compared to 2023. The number of staff
members increased from 180 at September 30, 2023 to 278 at September 30, 2024. During the same period, the Company further expanded its
leased space at its manufacturing and assembly facility in India and leased space in New York where the Company has installed its latest
generation SSi Mantra 3 Surgical Robotic System for demonstration purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
hosted a large scientific exhibition of its SSi Mantra Surgical Robotic System and also participated in various such events both in India
and overseas. In July 2024, the Company hosted an event in New York to introduce and showcase its SSi Mantra 3 Surgical Robotic System.
Having exported its products to Nepal, Ecuador and Indonesia during this nine month period, the Company s expense for travel and
overseas boarding and lodging of sales and field engineering teams has also increased. There has also been a significant increase in other
administrative expenses such as legal, consulting, advisory and audit fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable
period in 2023. 

Other Income/Expense . We incurred net other
income/ expense of 351,773 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 626,309 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Other expense consisted mainly of interest expenses related to bank overdraft and other income mainly consist of interest earned
on fixed deposits (offered as security against certain working capital facilities obtained from HDFC bank in India) and finance component
in sales on deferred payment basis, due to application of ASC606. The reduction in net other income/expense as reflected above was mainly
due to increased incidence of recognition of finance component in sales on deferred payment basis. 

Net Loss. We incurred a net loss of 11,699,076
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 4,060,806 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
increase in net loss is mainly attributable to a significant increase in stock compensation expenses described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company expects to require substantial funds
for expansion of its manufacturing capacity through the installation of additional machinery and equipment, bulk ordering of components
for use in manufacturing of its final products, conducting global clinical trials to meet various regulatory requirements, expanding its
senior level manpower strength in various functional areas, lease of additional office and manufacturing space, augmenting working capital
and establishing regional marketing offices. To meet these fund requirements, the Company is making efforts to raise long term funds by
way of equity or loans. 

In February 2024, the Company raised 2.45 million through a private offering
of 7 One-Year Convertible Promissory Notes (the 7 Notes from two affiliates 1,000,000 each), including Sushruta
Pvt Ltd. Sushruta and 450,000 from three other investors to finance its ongoing working capital requirements.
The 7 Notes are payable in full after 12 months from the respective dates of issuance of these 7 Notes and are convertible at the election
of the noteholder at any time through the maturity date at a per share price of 4.45. Sushruta is a Bahamian holding company, whose principal
shareholder is Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and principal shareholder of SSi. 

In April 2024, the Company borrowed 2.0 million from Sushruta to meet
working capital needs. The loan is evidenced by two one-year promissory notes (the One-Year Notes ), in the principal
amount of 1.0 million each. The One Year Notes accrue interest at the rate of 7 per annum, which is payable together with principal
one year from the date of issuance. In July 2024, the Company borrowed an additional 500,000 from Sushruta, evidenced by a One-Year Note
in such principal amount. 

26 

While we have been successful in raising funds
to meet our working capital needs to date and believe that we have the resources to do so for the balance of the year, we do not have
any committed sources of funding and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding if and when needed. The
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. If we cannot obtain adequate financing, then we may be forced to curtail our expansion plans. Even if we are successful in raising
the additional financing, there is no assurance regarding the terms of any additional investment and any such investment or other strategic
alternative would likely substantially dilute our current shareholders. 

Cash Flows used in Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash used in operating activities was 5,474,776 resulting from our net loss of 11,699,076 partially offset by non-cash charges of
 7,508,241 comprising of depreciation, stock compensation expense, shares issued against services and lease expense and cash used in interest
payments of 179,171 and an increase of 1,463,113 in net operating assets and liabilities comprising mainly of prepaid expenses and other
current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used by operating
activities was 12,128,972 resulting from our net loss of 4,060,806, partially offset by non-cash charges of 141,380 primarily driven
by depreciation and lease expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also had cash used in payment of interest of 138,537
and in increase in net operating assets and liabilities, to the extent of 8,348,083 comprising mainly of prepaid expenses and other current
assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023,
we had net cash used in investing activities of 1,655,495 and 629,247, respectively, which is the net result of cash used in additions
to property, plant and equipment and an increase in long term receivables. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had net cash provided by financing activities of 6,019,381, consisting of 4,950,000 from issuances of 7 Notes and a 1,069,381 increase
in bank overdraft. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net cash provided
by financing activities of 23,043,941 consisting primarily of the conversion into common stock of 19,980,000 in notes payable and a
 2,993,894 in bank overdraft. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates included deferred revenue, costs related to deferred revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment and the useful lives
of intangible assets. 

27 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based
on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations
of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If
tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred
tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more
likely than not criteria of ASC 740. 

ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize
the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain
the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized
in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with
the relevant tax authority. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Item 3. Quantitative Disclosures About Market
Risks. 

As a smaller reporting company, 
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

(a) Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

28 

Our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed
or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As more fully set forth in the Explanatory
Note appearing on the first page of this Report, the Company has determined that its previously issued financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 need to be restated.
Based on the need for the restatement and their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
as of September 30,2024 our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective, due to
material weaknesses in SSi s internal controls in that: 

We failed to design controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance
that U.S. GAAP was being properly applied to certain transactions, resulting in the accounting errors described in the Explanatory Note.

We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written
 documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section
 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written
 documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure
 controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
 a material weakness. 

We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic
 internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not
 always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible,
 the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should
 be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have
 segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and procedures
 and h as concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material
 weakness. 

The Company has been addressing and remediating
these material weaknesses with the support and assistance of the accounting and financial staff employed by our Indian operating subsidiary.
We are enhancing the review process for significant transactions to ensure proper accounting treatment under applicable guidelines and
are engaging external experts where necessary to assist in the application of accounting principles to complex transactions. In addition,
we are implementing a new ERP system which is designed to integrate all business functions within the accounting and financial department
to further address the abovementioned weaknesses. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure
controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further,
the design of any control system is subject to resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the fact that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. 

(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the remediation efforts described above,
there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

In April 2024, an ex-shareholder of Otto Pvt Ltd. Otto ), a Bahamian company which is a downstream subsidiary of the Company, commenced litigation in the Bahamas,
seeking legal confirmation that it holds 9,000 shares (approximately a 9 interest) in Otto. The litigation, in which Otto is one of the
defendants, relates to a purported transaction in 2021, at which time Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, the Company s current Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and principal shareholder, was the sole shareholder of Otto. The plaintiff in the litigation alleges that at that time,
it acquired the 9,000 Otto shares from Dr. Srivastava. However, as the plaintiff failed to pay the agreed upon consideration for the shares,
in July 2022, the shareholding was cancelled. Dr. Srivastava has recently filed an action in the Bahamas to confirm the cancellation of
the shares and reconfirm their ownership and both actions are pending in the Bahamian courts. The Bahamian court has issued an interim
order to maintain the status quo as it stands today with respect to the 9,000 Otto shares at the center of the dispute, as well as Otto s
shareholdings in Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt Ltd. SSI-India ), our Indian operating subsidiary, and SSI-India s assets
during the pendency of the litigation. Based on legal opinions obtained from counsel, the Company believes that there will be a favorable
outcome in this case. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dr. Srivastava
and the Company have entered into an Indemnification Agreement on October 12, 2024, pursuant to which Dr. Srivastava has agreed to fully
indemnify the Company for any claims, damages and costs (including legal fees) which it incurs in connection with this litigation or in
relation to any of his ventures prior to consummation of our acquisition by merger of CardioVentures, Inc. in April 2023. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company, 
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.

shares of common stock in a private transaction to five doctors/proctors in India in consideration of their ongoing contributions for
providing surgeon training support and proctoring surgeries on our recently installed SSi Mantra Surgical Robotic Systems. 

The foregoing shares of common stock were issued
in pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
