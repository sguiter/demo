 (Dollars are presented in thousands, except share, per share and per employee data or unless otherwise stated) 

and of the Company s revenue during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Company typically meets its short term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations, its available cash balances, the 2022 Credit Facility (as defined below), equipment financing, access to the public and private debt and/or equity markets, and has the option to raise capital from the sale of the Company s securities under the Company s registration statement on Form S- 3 (as discussed below), and proceeds from any sales of Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credits AMP credits (discussed in Note 5 AMP Credits of these condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 
 See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, of these condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of the 2022 Credit Facility and the Company s other debt. 
 
 Debt and finance lease obligations at September 30, 2024 totaled , which includes current outstanding debt and finance leases totaling . The Company s outstanding debt includes outstanding from the senior secured term loan under the 2022 Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed on the revolving line of credit and repaid such borrowings during the period. The Company had drawn on the revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2024. The Company s revolving line of credit balance, if any, is included in the Line of credit and current maturities of long-term debt line item in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 On September 22, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S- 3, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on October 12, 2023 the Form S- 3 ), replacing a prior shelf registration statement which expired on October 12, 2023. The Form S- 3 will expire on October 11, 2026. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows the Company to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, the Company would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes. 
 
 On September 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC and HC Wainwright Co., LLC (collectively, the Agents ). Pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through the Agents shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share with an aggregate sales price of up to . The Company will pay a commission to the Agents of of the gross proceeds of the sale of the shares sold under the Sales Agreement and reimburse the Agents for the expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under the Sales Agreement. No shares of the Company s common stock were issued under the Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023 or during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock having a value of approximately remained available for issuance under the Sales Agreement. Any additional shares offered and sold under the Sales Agreement are to be issued pursuant to the Form S- 3 and a 424 (b) prospectus supplement. 

The Company also utilizes supply chain financing arrangements as a component of its funding for working capital, which accelerates receivable collections and helps to better manage cash flow. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to sell certain of its accounts receivable balances to banking institutions who have agreed to advance amounts equal to the net accounts receivable balances due, less a discount as set forth in the respective agreements. The balances under these agreements are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, as they are sold without recourse. Cash proceeds from these agreements are reflected as operating activities included in the change in accounts receivable in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. Fees incurred in connection with the agreements are recorded as interest expense by the Company. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold account receivables totaling and , respectively, related to supply chain financing arrangements, of which customers financial institutions applied discount fees totaling and , respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold account receivables totaling and , respectively, related to supply chain financing arrangements, of which customers financial institutions applied discount fees totaling and , respectively. 
 
 In January 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a supply agreement for wind tower purchases valued at approximately million with a leading global wind turbine manufacturer. Under the terms of the supply agreement, order fulfillment was to occur beginning in 2023 through year-end 2024. In early November 2023, the parties jointly agreed to shift approximately half of the contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025, while maintaining the total number of tower sections stipulated under the supply agreement. 
 The Company anticipates that current cash resources, amounts available under the 2022 Credit Facility, sales of shares under the Sales Agreement, cash to be generated from operations and equipment financing, access to the public and private debt and/or equity markets, any potential proceeds from the sale of further Company securities under the Form S- 3, and proceeds from sales of AMP credits will be adequate to meet the Company s liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 If assumptions regarding the Company s production, sales and subsequent collections from certain of the Company s large customers, the Company s ability to finalize the terms of the remaining obligations under a supply agreement with a leading global wind turbine manufacturer, as well as receipt of customer deposits and revenues generated from new customer orders, are materially inconsistent with management s expectations, the Company may in the future encounter cash flow and liquidity issues. 
 
 If the Company s operational performance deteriorates, the Company may be unable to comply with existing financial covenants, and could lose access to the 2022 Credit Facility. This could limit the Company s operational flexibility, require a delay in making planned investments and/or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Any attempt to raise equity through the public markets could have a negative effect on the Company s stock price, making an equity raise more difficult or more dilutive. Any additional equity financing or equity-linked financing, if available, will be dilutive to stockholders, and additional debt financing, if available, would likely require new financial covenants or impose other operating and financial restrictions on the Company. While management believes that the Company will continue to have sufficient cash available to operate its businesses and to meet the Company s financial obligations and debt covenants, there can be no assurances that the Company s operations will generate sufficient cash, or that credit facilities or equity or equity-linked financings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to meet these financial obligations. 
 
 Reclassifications 
 
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Management s Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Significant estimates, among others, include inventory reserves, warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for credit losses, health insurance reserves, and valuation allowances on deferred taxes. Although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Gearing 
 Industrial Solutions 
 Eliminations 
 Consolidated 

Revenue within the Company s Gearing and Industrial Solutions segments, as well as industrial fabrication product line revenues within the Heavy Fabrications segment, are generally recognized at a point in time, typically when the promised goods or services are physically transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. The Company measures revenue based on the consideration specified in the purchase order and revenue is recognized when the performance obligations are satisfied. If applicable, the transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. 
 
 For many tower sales within the Company s Heavy Fabrications segment, products are sold under terms included in bill and hold sales arrangements that result in different timing for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue under these arrangements only when there is a substantive reason for the agreement, the ordered goods are identified separately as belonging to the customer and not available to fill other orders, the goods are currently ready for physical transfer to the customer, and the Company does not have the ability to use the product or to direct it to another customer. Assuming these required revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue is recognized upon completion of product manufacture and customer acceptance. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a portion of revenue within the Heavy Fabrications segment over time, as the products had no alternative use to the Company and the Company had an enforceable right to payment, including profit, upon termination of the contracts. Within the Heavy Fabrications segment, the Company recognized revenue for contracts that meet over time criteria of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Within the Heavy Fabrications segment, the Company recognized revenue over time of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company uses labor hours as the input measure of progress for the applicable Heavy Fabrications contracts because the projects are labor intensive. Contract assets are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied but the Company is not yet entitled to payment. Contract assets represent the Company s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the end of the period. 
 
 The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Customer deposits, deferred revenue and other receipts are deferred and recognized when the revenue is realized and earned. Cash payments to customers are classified as reductions of revenue in the Company s statement of operations. 
 
 The Company does not disclose the value of the unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

and , respectively, within the Heavy Fabrications segment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized AMP credits totaling and , respectively, within the Heavy Fabrications segment. These AMP credits were introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act IRA ), which was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes advanced manufacturing tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components, including wind components. Manufacturers of wind components qualify for the AMP credits based on the total rated capacity, expressed on a per watt basis, of the completed wind turbine for which such component is designed. The credit applies to each component produced and sold in the U.S. beginning in 2023 through 2032. Wind towers within the Company s Heavy Fabrications segment are eligible for credits of per watt for each wind tower produced. In calculating the eligible credit, the Company relied on the megawatt rating provided by the customers. Manufacturers who qualify for the AMP credits can apply to the Internal Revenue Service for cash refunds of the AMP credits, sell the AMP credits to third parties for cash, or apply the AMP credits against taxable income. The Company recognized the AMP credits as a reduction to cost of sales in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The assets related to the AMP credits are recognized as current assets in the AMP credit receivable line item in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 On December 21, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 2023 and 2024 AMP credits to a third party. At that time, the Company sold a portion of the gross 2023 credits in the amount of and recognized a discount on the sale in the amount of which was recognized in cost of sales. In addition, the Company wrote down the remaining receivable of to net realizable value and recorded the expected loss on sale of in cost of sales.

The Company is required to provide disclosure and categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e., inputs) used in the valuation. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. Financial instruments are assessed quarterly to determine the appropriate classification within the fair value hierarchy. Transfers between fair value classifications are made based upon the nature and type of the observable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 2 Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 
 Level 3 Valuations are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

, compared to a provision for income taxes of during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . On August 16, 2022, Congress enacted the IRA which includes advanced manufacturing tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components, including wind components produced and sold in the U.S. beginning in 2023 through 2032. These credits will have no impact on income tax expense. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024 , open tax years in federal and some state jurisdictions date back to 1996 due to the taxing authorities ability to adjust operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2023 , the Company had federal and unapportioned state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of of which will generally begin to expire in 2026. The majority of the NOL carryforwards will expire in various years from 2028 through 2037. NOLs generated after January 1, 2018 will not expire. 
 
 Since the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits, they will not have an impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the expiration of the applicable statues of limitations within the next twelve months. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the IRC ), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards and associated built-in losses that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone certain changes in stock ownership. The Company s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards and built-in losses may be limited, under Section 382 of the IRC or otherwise, by the Company s issuance of common stock or by other changes in stock ownership. Upon completion of the Company s analysis of Section 382 of the IRC in 2010, the Company determined that aggregate changes in stock ownership triggered an annual limitation on NOL carryforwards and built-in losses available for utilization, thereby currently limiting annual NOL usage to per year. Further limitations may occur, depending on additional future changes in stock ownership. To the extent the Company s use of NOL carryforwards and associated built-in losses is significantly limited in the future, the Company s income could be subject to U.S. corporate income tax earlier than it would be if the Company were able to use NOL carryforwards and built-in losses without such limitation, which could result in lower profits and the loss of benefits from these attributes. 
 
 In February 2013, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan, which was approved by the Company s stockholders and extended in 2016, 2019 and 2022 for additional three -year periods (as amended, the Rights Plan ), designed to preserve the Company s substantial tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards under Section 382 of the IRC. 
 
 The Rights Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group, together with its affiliates and associates, becoming the beneficial owner of or more of the Company s common stock and thereby triggering a further limitation of the Company s available NOL carryforwards. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, the Board declared a non-taxable dividend of preferred share purchase right (a Right for each outstanding share of the Company s common stock to the Company s stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2013. Each Right entitles its holder to purchase from the Company one one -thousandth of a share of the Company s Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of per Right, subject to adjustment. As a result of the Rights Plan, any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s common stock without the approval of the Board would be subject to significant dilution in the ownership interest of that person or group. Stockholders who owned or more of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock as of February 12, 2013 will not trigger the preferred share purchase rights unless they acquire additional shares after that date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company had accrued interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 .

(1) 
 We provide non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share based compensation and other stock payments, restructuring costs, impairment charges, proxy contest-related expenses, and other non-cash gains and losses) as supplemental information regarding our business performance. Our management uses adjusted EBITDA when it internally evaluates the performance of our business, reviews financial trends and makes operating and strategic decisions. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it provides a better understanding of our past financial performance and future results, and it allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same methodology and information as used by our management. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts. 

(2) 
 We define free cash flow as adjusted EBITDA plus or minus changes in operating working capital less capital expenditures net of any proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our business for purposes such as repaying maturing debt and funding future investments. 

(3) 
 We define operating working capital as accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable and customer deposits. 

(4) 
 Our backlog at September 30, 2024 and 2023 is net of revenue recognized over time. Backlog as of September 30, 2024 has been adjusted to reflect updated assumptions related to raw material pricing (which is a customer passthrough) and other variables. 

(5) 
 We define the book-to-bill as the ratio of new orders we received, net of cancellations, to revenue during a period.

OUR BUSINESS 
 
 Third Quarter Overview 
 
 We received 22,975 in new orders in the third quarter of 2024, up from 15,890 in the third quarter of 2023. Within our Heavy Fabrications segment, orders increased primarily due to the timing of orders associated with wind repowering projects. Partially offsetting this was a 56 decrease in industrial fabrication orders, primarily due to reduced industrial and mining demand. Orders within our Industrial Solutions segment increased 52 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in orders associated with new gas turbine projects. Gearing segment orders increased 46 from the prior year period primarily due to improved demand from most markets served. 
 
 We recognized revenue of 35,503 in the third quarter of 2024, down 38 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Within the Heavy Fabrications segment wind tower revenue decreased 45 from the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in tower sections sold as a global wind turbine manufacturer shifted approximately half of its contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025. Additionally, industrial fabrication revenues decreased primarily due to reduced shipments of our Pressure Reducing Systems PRS units from the prior year period. Gearing segment revenue decreased 20 relative to the comparable prior year period primarily due to reduced shipments to oil and gas O G customers, partially offset by increased shipments to industrial customers. Industrial Solutions segment revenue decreased by 23 from the prior year period primarily due to reduced shipments to international customers. 
 
 We recorded net income of 74 or 0.00 per share in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 4,394 or 0.21 per share in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in net income was primarily attributable to lower tower sales within our Heavy Fabrications segment and the corresponding decrease in the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credits AMP credits earned.

Consolidated 
 
 Revenues decreased by 21,660 as compared to the prior year period as we experienced a drop in revenue across all three operating segments. Within our Heavy Fabrications segment, wind tower revenue decreased 45 from the prior year period primarily due to a 54 decrease in tower sections sold as a global wind turbine manufacturer shifted approximately half of its contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025. In addition, industrial fabrications revenue decreased by 50 due largely to reduced sales of our PRS units. Gearing segment revenue decreased 20 relative to the comparable prior year period, reflective of reduced shipments to O G customers, partially offset by increased shipments to industrial customers. Industrial Solutions segment revenue decreased 23 from the prior year period primarily due to reduced shipments to international customers. 
 
 Gross profit decreased by 4,970 when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower sales and the decrease in AMP credits earned. Operating expenses decreased from the prior year period primarily due to lower incentive compensation and commissions in the current year quarter. 
 
 Net income was 74 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 4,394 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income was primarily due to the factors described above.

Within our Heavy Fabrications segment, orders increased 39 from the prior year period as wind orders increased primarily due to the timing of orders associated with wind repowering projects. Partially offsetting this was a 56 decrease in industrial fabrication orders, primarily due to reduced demand from industrial and mining customers. Segment revenues decreased by 46 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a 45 decrease in wind tower revenue. The decrease in wind tower revenue was primarily a result of less tower sections sold, as a global wind turbine manufacturer shifted approximately half of its contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025. Additionally, industrial fabrication revenues decreased by 50 during the current year period primarily due to reduced shipments of our PRS units in the current year quarter. 
 
 Heavy Fabrications segment operating income decreased by 3,561 as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in operating performance was primarily a result of lower tower sales and the corresponding reduction in AMP credits recognized, as well as lower industrial fabrication revenues. These factors were partially offset by reduced overhead costs. Operating margin was 10.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.1 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the factors described above.

Consolidated 
 
 Revenues decreased by 47,308 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower sales within the Heavy Fabrications and Gearing segments, partially offset by increased sales within the Industrial Solutions segment. Wind revenue decreased 44 from the prior year period primarily due to a 52 decrease in tower sections sold as a global wind turbine manufacturer shifted approximately half of its contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025. Gearing segment revenue decreased 19 relative to the comparable prior year period reflective of reduced shipments within most markets served, but most significantly within O G. This was partially offset by higher shipments to aftermarket wind customers. Industrial Solutions segment revenue increased 6 from the prior year period primarily due to increased shipments of new and aftermarket gas turbine content, partially offset by reduced shipments to international customers. 
 
 Gross profit decreased by 8,076 when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by reduced overhead costs. Operating expenses decreased from the prior year period primarily as a result of the absence of proxy-contest related expenses that were recognized in the prior year period. 
 
 Net income was 2,066 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 6,578 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income was primarily due to the factors described above.

Within our Heavy Fabrications segment, orders decreased 22 primarily due to reduced demand for our PRS units. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in orders associated with wind repowering projects. Segment revenues decreased by 40 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 44 decrease in wind tower revenue. The decrease in wind revenue was primarily a result of less tower sections sold as a global wind turbine manufacturer shifted approximately half of its contracted tower section orders initially planned for 2024 into 2025. 
 
 Heavy Fabrications segment operating income decreased by 6,616 as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in operating performance was primarily a result of lower tower sales and the corresponding reduction in AMP credits recognized. These factors were partially offset by reduced overhead costs. Operating margin was 9.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the factors described above.

This was partially offset by higher shipments to aftermarket wind customers. 
 
 Gearing segment operating income decreased by 765 compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales, partially offset by a more profitable product mix sold and cost savings. Operating margin was 1.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 3.5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the items identified above.

Industrial Solutions segment orders increased from the prior year period primarily due to improved orders associated with new gas turbine projects, partially offset by reduced orders associated with aftermarket projects. Segment revenues increased from the prior year period primarily due to increased shipments of aftermarket gas turbine content, partially offset by reduced shipments to international customers. Operating income increased versus the prior-year period primarily as a result of higher sales and a more profitable mix of product sold. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 
 Corporate and Other expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to the absence of professional fees associated with the contested proxy election recognized in the prior year quarter and lower employee compensation costs. 

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 On August 4, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender Wells Fargo ), providing the Company and its subsidiaries with a 35,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased by up to an additional 10,000 upon the request of the Company and at the sole discretion of Wells Fargo) and a 7,578 senior secured term loan (collectively, the 2022 Credit Facility ). The proceeds of the 2022 Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes, including strategic growth opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, cash totaled 1,384, an increase of 285 from December 31, 2023. Debt and finance lease obligations at September 30, 2024 totaled 23,353. As of September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to an additional 17,614 un der the 2022 Credit Facility. 
 
 In addition to the 2022 Credit Facility, we also utilize supply chain financing arrangements as a component of our funding for working capital, which accelerates receivable collections and helps to better manage cash flow. Under these agreements, we have agreed to sell certain of our accounts receivable balances to banking institutions who have agreed to advance amounts equal to the net accounts receivable balances due, less a discount as set forth in the respective agreements. The balances under these agreements are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, as they are sold without recourse. Cash proceeds from these agreements are reflected as operating activities included in the change in accounts receivable in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Fees incurred in connection with the agreements are recorded as interest expense. 
 
 We also have outstanding notes payable for capital expenditures in the amount of 1,706 and 1,361 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with 365 and 163 included in the Line of Credit and current maturities of long-term debt line item of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The notes payable have monthly payments that range from 1 to 20 and an interest rate of approximately 7 . The equipment purchased is utilized as collateral for the notes payable. The outstanding notes payable have maturity dates that range from September 2028 to June 2029. 
 
 On September 22, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on October 12, 2023 (the Form S-3 ), replacing a prior shelf registration statement which expired on October 12, 2023. The Form S-3 will expire on October 11, 2026. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes. 
 
 On September 12, 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC and HC Wainwright Co., LLC (collectively, the Agents ). Pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may sell from time to time through the Agents shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to 12,000. We will pay a commission to the Agents of 2.75 of the gross proceeds of the sale of the shares sold under the Sales Agreement and reimburse the Agents for the expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under the Sales Agreement. No shares of the Company s common stock were issued under the Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023 or nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares of our common stock having a value of approximately 11,667 remained available for issuance under the Sales Agreement. Any additional shares offered and sold under the Sales Agreement are to be issued pursuant to the Form S-3 and a 424(b) prospectus supplement. 
 
 We anticipate that current cash resources, amounts available under the 2022 Credit Facility, cash to be generated from operations and equipment financing, potential proceeds from the sale of securities under the Sales Agreement, access to the public or private debt and/or equity markets including any potential proceeds from the sale of further securities under the Form S-3, and proceeds from sales of AMP credits will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.

Table of Contents 

If assumptions regarding our production, sales and subsequent collections from certain of our large customers, our ability to finalize the terms of the remaining obligations under a supply agreement with a leading global wind turbine manufacturer, as well as receipt of customer deposits and revenues generated from new customer orders, are materially inconsistent with management s expectations, we may in the future encounter cash flow and liquidity issues. 
 
 If our operational performance deteriorates, we may be unable to comply with existing financial covenants, and could lose access to the 2022 Credit Facility. This could limit our operational flexibility, require a delay in making planned investments and/or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Any attempt to raise equity through the public markets could have a negative effect on our stock price, making an equity raise more difficult or more dilutive. Any additional equity financing or equity-linked financing, if available, will be dilutive to stockholders, and additional debt financing, if available, would likely require new financial covenants or impose other operating and financial restrictions on us. While we believe that we will continue to have sufficient cash available to operate our businesses and to meet our financial obligations and debt covenants, there can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash, or that credit facilities or equity or equity-linked financings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet these financial obligations. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating Cash Flows 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled 986 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 22,593 during the prior year period. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities during the current year period was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of the 2023 AMP credits received during the current year period, in addition to a decrease in accounts receivable during the current year period compared to a significant increase in accounts receivable during the prior year period due to a change in payment terms with a major customer. This was partially offset by a more significant decrease in customer deposits during the current year period. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities tot aled 3,120, comp ared to net cash used in investing activities of 5,300 during the prior year period. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities as compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to a net decrease in purchases of property and equipment. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities tot aled 4,391, co mpared to net cash provided by financing activities of 16,901 during the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to decreased net borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility in the current year period. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
