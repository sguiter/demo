to of their cost, depending on the utilization profile of the equipment. We generally depreciate new trailers over seven years for refrigerated trailers and ten years for dry van trailers to salvage values of approximately and of their cost, respectively. We annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is warranted, review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets, based upon, among other things, our experience with similar assets, conditions in the used revenue equipment market, and prevailing industry practice. We performed a review of our estimates for certain subsets of revenue equipment during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and, due to a weak used revenue equipment market, we increased the rate of depreciation on these units in the period. This change resulted in an additional million and million of depreciation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Changes in the useful life or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates, could have a material effect on our results of operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we sold a Tennessee terminal resulting in a million gain which is included in gain on disposition of property and equipment, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

There were unvested shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as anti-dilutive for either of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were approximately and shares issuable upon conversion of unvested employee stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and shares issuable upon conversion of unvested employee stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively.

 Contingent consideration 3 
 Cash surrender value life insurance policies 2 

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current debt approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. 
 
 Interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, which primarily consists of revenue equipment installment notes. The fair value of our revenue equipment installment notes approximated the carrying value as of September 30, 2024 , as the weighted average interest rate on these notes approximates the market rate for similar debt. Borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) approximate fair value due to the variable interest rate on that facility. 
 
 Contingent consideration arrangements require us to pay up to million of additional consideration to AAT Carriers, Inc.'s ("AAT's") former shareholders based on AAT's results during the first two post-acquisition years, of which the final installment was made during 2024, up to million of additional consideration to Lew Thompson Son Trucking, Inc.'s ("LTST's") former shareholders based on LTST's results during the first three calendar years following closing, and up to million of additional consideration to Sims Transport Services, LLC's ("Sims") former shareholders based on Sims' results during the first four calendar years following closing. Refer to Note 13, "Acquisition of Lew Thompson Son Trucking, Inc.", for additional information regarding the LTST acquisition and Note 12, "Acquisition of Sims Transport Services, LLC", for additional information regarding the Sims acquisition. 
 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration is adjusted at each reporting period based on changes to the expected cash flows and related assumptions. There were contingent consideration payments made during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, and million and million paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on AAT's results for the first and second post-acquisition years. Of the million paid for the contingent consideration liability during 2024, million was classified as financing cash flows and million was classified as operating cash flows within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Of the million paid for the contingent consideration liability during 2023, million was classified as financing cash flows and million was classified as operating cash flows within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of the contingent consideration increased million and increased million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and increased by million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Of the 2024 increases, increases of million and million related to a change in the fair value for the LTST contingent consideration arrangement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 partially offset by decreases of million and million related to a change in the fair value for the Sims contingent consideration arrangement. Of the 2023 increases, million was related to the initial recognition of the Sims contingent consideration arrangement and million was due to a change in the fair value for the AAT contingent consideration arrangement for the three month period and million was related to the initial recognition of the LTST contingent consideration arrangement, million was due to a change in the fair value for the AAT contingent consideration arrangement, and million was related to the initial recognition of the Sims contingent consideration arrangement for the nine -month period. The adjustment to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was recorded as a component of general supplies and expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The contingent consideration liability is included in accounts payable and other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The following table provides a summary (in thousands) of the activity for the contingent consideration liability for 2024: 

million of net accounts receivable, which included million of gross accounts receivable, less advances and rebates of million. 
 
 We have reflected the former Factoring reportable segment as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 
 
 The following table summarizes the results of our discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 : 
 Income before income taxes 
 Income tax expense 
 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 

Reversal of contingent loss liability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relates to the reduced exposure of future indemnification by the Company to the purchaser of TFS, Triumph Bancorp, Inc. ("Triumph"), as a result of the collection of covered receivables identified in the amended purchase agreement. 
 
 The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities included as discontinued operations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 : 

Noncurrent assets from discontinued operations 
 Total assets from discontinued operations

to income before income taxes, primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal income tax effect, adjusted for permanent differences the most significant of which is the effect of the per diem pay structure for drivers. Drivers who meet the requirements to receive per diem receive non-taxable per-diem pay in lieu of a portion of their taxable wages. This per diem program increases our drivers' net pay per mile, after taxes, while decreasing gross pay, before taxes. As a result, salaries, wages, and related expenses are slightly lower and our effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate. Generally, as pre-tax income increases, the impact of the driver per diem program on our effective tax rate decreases, because aggregate per diem pay becomes smaller in relation to pre-tax income, while in periods where earnings are at or near breakeven the impact of the per diem program on our effective tax rate is significant. Due to the partially nondeductible effect of per diem pay, our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods based on fluctuations in earnings. 
 
 Our liability recorded for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 is unchanged since December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The net deferred tax liability of million primarily relates to differences in cumulative book versus tax depreciation of property and equipment, partially off-set by net operating loss carryovers and insurance claims that have been reserved but not paid. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate, based on certain estimates and assumptions, sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets, which would result in additional income tax expense. On a periodic basis, we assess the need for adjustment of the valuation allowance. The Company has determined that a valuation allowance was not necessary at September 30, 2024 for its deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not they will be realized from the future reversals of temporary differences. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to modify our valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets. 
 
 On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan ("ARPA") into law. The law includes several provisions meant to stimulate the U.S. economy. Of relevance to the Company, ARPA extended the reach of IRC Section 162 (m) to include compensation paid to the eight highest-paid individuals other than the chief executive officer and the chief financial officers (rather than the three highest), however, this change is not effective until 2027. There is no material impact to the financial statements at this time. 
 
 President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA") into law on August 16, 2022. We do not anticipate the IRA will have a significant impact on income tax expense or on other taxes. One of the most impactful provisions of the IRA includes the establishment of a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax ("CAMT"). However, this tax only applies to corporations with three -year average earnings in excess of 1.0 billion. We will continue to monitor the CAMT each year to determine if we will become an applicable corporation. Additionally, the IRA enacted an excise tax on stock buybacks, which imposes a 1 tax on stock buybacks, subject to netting provisions regarding stock awarded to employees as part of their compensation. We do not believe this will have a material impact on our active buyback program, but will continue to monitor IRS guidance and regulations on how the buyback tax will be imposed and administered.

We and substantially all of our subsidiaries are parties to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with Bank of America, N.A., as agent (the "Agent") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (together with the Agent, the "Lenders"). The Credit Facility is a million revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that, so long as no event of default exists, allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to million subject to Lender acceptance of the additional funding commitment. The Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub facility in an aggregate amount of million and a swing line sub facility in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of million or of the Lenders' aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility from time-to-time. The Credit Facility matures in May 2027. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either "base rate loans" or "SOFR loans." Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the greater of the Agent s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus , or SOFR for a one month period as of such day, plus an applicable margin ranging from to 0.75 ; while SOFR loans accrued interest at SOFR, plus an applicable margin ranging from to . The applicable rates are adjusted quarterly based on average pricing availability. The unused line fee is the product of times the average daily amount by which the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility exceed the outstanding principal amount of revolver loans and the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate, revenue equipment pledged under other financing agreements, including revenue equipment installment notes and finance leases, and revenue equipment that we do not designate as being included in the borrowing base. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base limited to the lesser of (A) 110.0 million, minus the sum of the stated amount of all outstanding letters of credit; or (B) the sum of (i) of eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) the least of (a) of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible revenue equipment, (b) of the net book value of eligible revenue equipment, (c) of the Lenders' aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, or (d) million. 
 
 We had borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 , undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately million, and available borrowing capacity of million. As of September 30, 2024 , there were base rate and SOFR loans. Based on availability as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there was fixed charge coverage requirement. 

The Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the Lenders' commitments may be terminated. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Facility and the Lenders cause, or have the ability to cause, all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Facility to become due and payable, this could result in a default under other debt instruments that contain acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, debt, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, and affiliate transactions. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility could result in an event of default. 
 
 Pricing for the revenue equipment installment notes is quoted by the respective financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders at the funding of each group of equipment acquired and include fixed annual rates for new equipment under retail installment contracts. The notes included in the funding are due in monthly installments with final maturities at various dates ranging from February 2028 to March 2029 . The notes contain certain requirements regarding payment, insuring of collateral, and other matters, but do not have any financial or other material covenants or events of default except certain notes totaling million are cross-defaulted with the Credit Facility. Additional borrowings from the financial affiliates of our primary revenue equipment suppliers and other lenders are expected to be available to fund new tractors expected to be delivered in 2024 , while any other property and equipment purchases, including trailers, are expected to be funded with a combination of available cash, notes, operating leases, finance leases, and/or from the Credit Facility. 
 
 In August 2015, we financed a portion of the purchase of our corporate headquarters, a maintenance facility, and certain surrounding property in Chattanooga, Tennessee by entering into a million variable rate note with a third -party lender. The note contains certain restrictions and covenants that are usual and customary for a note of this nature. Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions set forth in the note could result in an event of default. Concurrently with entering into the note, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively fix the related interest rate to . We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants for the next 12 months. 
 
 In connection with the settlement of a dispute related to the sale of TFS (the "TFS Settlement"), in September 2020, TBK Bank, SSB, as lender and agent for Triumph TBK Bank ), provided the Company with a million line of credit (the Draw Note ), the proceeds of which are to be used solely to satisfy our indemnification obligations under the TFS Settlement. We may borrow pursuant to the Draw Note until September 23, 2025.

 Executive Overview 
 
 We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of 0.94 per diluted share. Our third quarter s results include year over year freight revenue growth of 2.1 , operating income growth of 7.2 , and a 36.6 million sequential reduction of our net indebtedness, composed of total debt and finance lease obligations, net of cash, while improving the average age of our fleet by one month. Our core business continues to perform well despite the prolonged general freight market down cycle, as a result of capitalizing on new value-added commercial opportunities where available, allocating equipment investments toward more profitable operations, and controlling costs. 
 
 Our asset-based segments, consisting of Expedited and Dedicated, contributed approximately 69 of total revenue and 66 of total freight revenue in the quarter. Our combined truckload operations experienced improved year over year margins primarily related to operating 8.0 more average tractors combined with improved freight revenue per total mile, partially offset by a reduction in utilization and higher costs compared to the prior year quarter. 
 
 Our asset-light segments, consisting of Managed Freight and Warehousing, contributed approximately 31 of total revenue and 34 of total freight revenue in the quarter. Year over year freight revenue and operating income each declined 6.5 , due to the combination of softer volumes of available profitable freight and a large cargo related claim incurred during the third quarter in our Managed Freight reportable segment, which was partially offset by improved cost efficiencies and rate increases in our Warehousing reportable segment.

Additional items of note for the third quarter of 2024 include the following: 

Total revenue of 287.9 million, a decrease of 0.3 compared with the third quarter of 2023, and freight revenue (which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges) of 258.6 million, an increase of 2.1 compared with the third quarter of 2023; 

Operating income of 16.2 million, compared with 15.1 million in the third quarter of 2023; 

Net income of 13.0 million, or 0.94 per diluted share, compared with 13.5 million, or 0.99 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income from continuing operations of 12.9 million, or 0.93 per diluted share, compared to 13.4 million or 0.98 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income from discontinued operations of 0.2 million, or 0.01 per diluted share, compared to 0.2 million, or 0.01 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023; 

Our equity investment in TEL provided 4.0 million of pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.3 million in the third quarter of 2023; 

We distributed a total of 1.5 million to stockholders through dividends; 

Since December 31, 2023, total indebtedness, comprised of total debt and finance leases, net of cash, decreased by 11.6 million to 236.7 million, primarily due to cash flows from operations exceeding our net capital investment in revenue equipment of 72.9 million and the final post-acquisition earnout payment of 10.0 million related to AAT s operational performance. With available borrowing capacity of 90.3 million under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 we do not expect to be required to test our fixed charge covenant in the foreseeable future; 

Leverage ratio (ending total indebtedness, comprised of debt and finance leases, net of cash, divided by the sum of operating income, depreciation and amortization, gain on disposition of property and equipment, net, and impairment of long lived property and equipment) as of September 30, 2024 was 1.76; 

Stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024, was 431.6 million; 

Tangible book value at September 30, 2024, was 260.1 million; and 

During the third quarter of 2024, we voluntarily transferred the listing of our Class A common stock to the New York Stock Exchange from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 

Outlook 
 
 Although we are pleased with our results for the period, our belief is that the overall general freight market will take time to meaningfully improve. The combination of lingering excess carrier capacity and the lack of an immediate catalyst to improve volumes, feeds our thesis that improvements will be slow and steady. While we are seeing some green shoots in the form of new dedicated business awards and a small number of customer rate increases, these wins have somewhat been offset with softer than anticipated volumes, particularly in our Expedited reportable segment. Additionally, we remind investors that our less volatile operating model, consisting of a large percentage of multi-year contractual agreements, will likely take time to execute and recognize the benefits of operational leverage than our historical model if and when freight demand and pricing improve materially. Regardless of the operating environment, our focus and commitment remains unchanged as we execute our strategic plan through tactical step by step execution that will continue to allow us to capitalize on opportunities that drive us deeper into the supply chain, add value for our customers, and create efficiencies across our enterprise, which we believe will allow us to become a stronger, more profitable, and more predictable business.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
 
 In addition to operating ratio, we use "adjusted operating ratio" as a key measure of profitability. Adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for operating ratio measured in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating ratio means operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, excluding amortization of intangibles, and significant unusual items, divided by total revenue, less fuel surcharge revenue. We believe the use of adjusted operating ratio allows us to more effectively compare periods, while excluding the potentially volatile effect of changes in fuel prices, amortization of intangibles, and significant unusual items. Our Board and management focus on our adjusted operating ratio as an indicator of our performance from period to period. We believe our presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts the same information that we use internally to assess our core operating performance. Although we believe that adjusted operating ratio improves comparability in analyzing our period-to-period performance, it could limit comparability to other companies in our industry, if those companies define adjusted operating ratio differently. Because of these limitations, adjusted operating ratio should not be considered a measure of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.

Revenue and Expenses 
 
 We focus on targeted markets throughout the United States where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage. We are a major carrier for transportation companies such as parcel freight forwarders, less-than-truckload carriers, and third-party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses, as well as for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers, retailers, and food and beverage shippers. 
 
 We have four reportable segments, which include: 

Expedited: The Expedited reportable segment primarily provides truckload services to customers with high service freight and delivery standards, such as 1,000 miles in 22 hours, or 15-minute delivery windows. Expedited services generally require two-person driver teams on equipment either owned or leased by the Company. 

Dedicated: The Dedicated reportable segment provides customers with committed truckload capacity over contracted periods with the goal of three to five years in length. Equipment is either owned or leased by the Company. 

Managed Freight: The Managed Freight reportable segment includes our brokerage and transport management services TMS ). Brokerage services provide logistics capacity by outsourcing the carriage of customers freight to third parties. TMS provides comprehensive logistics services on a contractual basis to customers who prefer to outsource their logistics needs. 

Warehousing: The Warehousing reportable segment provides day-to-day warehouse management services to customers who have chosen to outsource this function. We also provide shuttle and switching services related to shuttling containers and trailers in or around freight yards and to/from warehouses. 

In our Expedited and Dedicated reportable segments, we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers. Generally, we are paid a predetermined rate per mile for our truckload services. We enhance our truckload revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention, loading and unloading activities, and other specialized services, as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel. The main factors that could affect our Expedited and Dedicated revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, and the number of shipments and miles we generate. These factors relate, among other things, to the general level of economic activity in the United States, inventory levels, specific customer demand, the level of capacity in the trucking industry, and driver availability. 
 
 The main expenses that impact the profitability of our Expedited and Dedicated reportable segments are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers. These costs include fuel expenses, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and purchased transportation expenses, which primarily include compensating independent contractors. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, self-insured retention versus insurance premiums, fleet age, efficiency, and other factors. Historically, our main fixed costs include rentals and depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and terminal facilities, and the compensation of non-driver personnel.

Table of Contents 

Within our Expedited and Dedicated reportable segments, we operate tractors driven by a single driver and also tractors assigned to two-person driver teams. Our single driver tractors generally operate in shorter lengths of haul, generate fewer miles per tractor, and experience more non-revenue miles, but the lower productive miles are expected to be offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver. In contrast, our two-person driver tractors generally operate in longer lengths of haul, generate greater miles per tractor, and experience fewer non-revenue miles, but we typically receive lower revenue per loaded mile and incur higher employee expenses of compensating both drivers. We expect operating statistics and expenses to shift with the mix of single and team operations. 
 
 Within our Managed Freight reportable segment, we derive revenue from Brokerage and TMS services, particularly, for arranging transportation services for customers, directly and through relationships with thousands of third-party carriers and integration with our Expedited reportable segment. Additionally, utilizing technology and process management we provide detailed visibility into a customer s movement of freight inbound and outbound throughout the customer s network and focused customer support through multiyear contracts. We provide Brokerage services directly and through agents, who are paid a commission for the freight they provide. The main factors that impact profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of outsourcing the transportation freight for our customers and managing fixed costs, including purchased transportation, facility warehousing costs, salaries, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 

Within our Warehousing reportable segment, we empower customers to outsource warehousing management, including moving containers and trailers in or around freight yards. The main factors that impact profitability in terms of expenses are fixed costs, including salaries, facility warehousing costs, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 

In May 2011, we acquired a 49.0 interest in TEL. TEL is a tractor and trailer equipment leasing company and used equipment reseller. We have accounted for our investment in TEL using the equity method of accounting and thus our financial results include our proportionate share of TEL's net income since May 2011. 
 
 Our main measures of profitability are operating ratio and adjusted operating ratio. We define adjusted operating ratio as operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, excluding amortization of intangibles, and significant unusual items, divided by total revenue, less fuel surcharge revenue. See page 25 for the uses and limitations associated with adjusted operating ratio. 
 
 Revenue Equipment 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we operated 2,306 tractors and 6,484 trailers. Of such tractors, 2,169 were owned, 22 were financed under finance or operating leases, and 115 tractors were provided by independent contractors, who own and drive their own tractors. Of such trailers, 5,842 were owned and 642 were held under finance or operating leases. At September 30, 2024, our fleet had an average tractor age of 1.6 years and an average trailer age of 5.6 years. 
 
 Independent contractors provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile. We do not have the capital outlay of purchasing or leasing the tractor. The payments to independent contractors and the financing of equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation. Expenses associated with company owned equipment, such as interest and depreciation, and expenses associated with employee drivers, including driver compensation, fuel, and other expenses, are not incurred with respect to independent contractors. Obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to "above the line" operating expenses, and as such, we evaluate our efficiency using net income margin, as well as operating ratio.

The decrease in total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a 6.3 million and 4.3 million decrease in Managed Freight and Expedited freight revenue, respectively, and a 6.1 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 15.7 million and 0.1 million increase in Dedicated and Warehousing freight revenue, respectively. The increase in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a 34.6 million, 3.6 million, and 1.4 million increase in Dedicated, Expedited, and Warehousing freight revenue, respectively, and a 7.7 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 7.2 million decrease in Managed Freight revenue. 
 
 See results of reportable segment operations section for discussion of fluctuations. 
 
 For comparison purposes in the discussion below, we use total revenue and freight revenue (total revenue less fuel surcharge revenue) when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 For each expense item discussed below, we have provided a table setting forth the relevant expense first as a percentage of total revenue, and then as a percentage of freight revenue.

Salaries, wages, and related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily as a result of averaging more drivers and tractors due to growth in our Dedicated reportable segment, resulting in higher driver salaries, wages, and benefits, as well as an increase in workers' compensation expense due to a large current period claim. 
 
 We believe salaries, wages, and related expenses will continue to increase as the result of wage inflation, higher healthcare costs, and, in certain periods, increased incentive compensation due to better performance. Driver pay may also fluctuate based on the number of miles driven. While driver pay remains stable at the present time, we have historically put driver pay increases in place as necessary to address driver market pressure and will continue to do so in the future as necessary. If freight market rates increase, we would expect to, as we have historically, pass a portion of those rate increases on to our professional drivers. Salaries, wages, and related expenses will fluctuate to some extent based on the percentage of revenue generated by independent contractors and our Managed Freight reportable segment, for which payments are reflected in the purchased transportation line item.

The decreases in total fuel expense are primarily related to lower fuel prices in the 2024 periods partially offset by a 3.4 and 6.5 increase in total miles compared to the same 2023 periods, respectively. 
 
 We receive a fuel surcharge on our loaded miles from most shippers; however, this does not cover the entire cost of fuel for several reasons, including the following: surcharges cover only loaded miles we operate; surcharges do not cover miles driven out-of-route by our drivers; and surcharges typically do not cover refrigeration unit fuel usage or fuel burned by tractors while idling. Moreover, most of our business relating to shipments obtained from freight brokers does not carry a fuel surcharge. Finally, fuel surcharges vary in the percentage of reimbursement offered, and not all surcharges fully compensate for fuel price increases even on loaded miles. 
 
 The rate of fuel price changes also can have an impact on results. Most fuel surcharges are based on the average fuel price as published by the Department of Energy ("DOE") for the week prior to the shipment, meaning we typically bill customers in the current week based on the previous week's applicable index. Therefore, in times of increasing fuel prices, we do not recover as much as we are currently paying for fuel. In periods of declining prices, the opposite is true. Fuel prices as measured by the DOE wer e 0.62 per g allon, or 14.5 , lower for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same quarter in 2023. 
 
 To measure the effectiveness of our fuel surcharge program, we subtract fuel surcharge revenue (other than the fuel surcharge revenue we reimburse to independent contractors and other third parties which is included in purchased transportation) from our fuel expense. The result is referred to as net fuel expense. Our net fuel expense as a percentage of freight revenue is affected by the cost of diesel fuel net of fuel surcharge revenue, the percentage of miles driven by company tractors, our fuel economy, and our percentage of deadhead miles, for which we do not receive material fuel surcharge revenues. 
 
 Net fuel expense is shown below:

For the periods presented, net fuel expense decreased as a percentage of freight revenue primarily due to lower fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge recovery. 
 
 We expect to continue managing our idle time and tractor speeds, investing in more fuel-efficient tractors and auxiliary power units to improve our miles per gallon, locking in fuel hedges when deemed appropriate, partnering with customers to adjust fuel surcharge programs that are inadequate to recover a fair portion of fuel costs, and testing the latest technologies that reduce fuel consumption. Going forward, our net fuel expense is expected to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on factors such as diesel fuel prices, percentage recovered from fuel surcharge programs, percentage of uncompensated miles, percentage of revenue generated by team-driven tractors (which tend to generate higher miles and lower revenue per mile, thus proportionately more fuel cost as a percentage of revenue), percentage of revenue generated from independent contractors, and the success of fuel efficiency initiatives.

The increase in operations and maintenance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was insignificant both as a percentage of total revenue and freight revenue. The decrease in operations and maintenance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to a decrease in the average age of our fleet and the improvement in both availability and cost of tires and maintenance related parts compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Going forward, we believe this category will fluctuate based on several factors, including the condition of the driver market and our ability to hire and retain drivers, our continued ability to maintain a relatively young fleet, accident severity and frequency, weather, the reliability of new and untested revenue equipment models, and the global disruption of the supply chain. Additionally, operations and maintenance costs may increase if we experience wage and parts inflation.

The decreases in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of a decrease in purchased transportation costs due to the decline in the spot market primarily affecting the Managed Freight reportable segment. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset as total miles run by independent contractors increased from 7.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.2 for the same 2024 period. 
 
 We expect purchased transportation to fluctuate as volumes in our Managed Freight reportable segment may be volatile. In addition, if fuel prices increase, it would result in a further increase in what we pay third party carriers and independent contractors. However, this expense category will fluctuate with the number and percentage of loads hauled by independent contractors, loads handled by Managed Freight, and tractors, trailers, and other assets financed with operating leases. In addition, factors such as the cost to obtain third party transportation services and the amount of fuel surcharge revenue passed through to the third party carriers and independent contractors will affect this expense category. If industry-wide trucking capacity tightens in relation to freight demand, we may need to increase the amounts we pay to third-party transportation providers and independent contractors, which could increase this expense category on an absolute basis and as a percentage of freight revenue absent an offsetting increase in revenue. If we were to recruit more independent contractors, we would expect this line item to increase as a percentage of revenue.

Insurance and claims per mile cost decreased to 17.4 cents per mile for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased to 21.3 cents per mile for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 19.2 cents per mile and 18.7 cents per mile, respectively, for the same 2023 periods. The decrease on a cents per mile basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of increased miles compared to the same 2023 period. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of current period claims expense and the development of prior period claims compared to the same 2023 period. 
 
 Our insurance program includes multi-year policies with specific insurance limits that may be eroded over the course of the policy term. If that occurs, we will be operating with less liability coverage insurance at various levels of our insurance tower. For the policy period that ran from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2021, the aggregate limits available in the coverage layer 9.0 million in excess of 1.0 million were fully eroded. We replaced our 9.0 million in excess of 1.0 million layer with a new 7.0 million in excess of 3.0 million policy that we continue to maintain. Due to the erosion of the 9.0 million in excess of 1.0 million layer, any adverse developments in claims filed between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2021, could result in additional expense accruals. We have maintained our retention and limits set in place during the prior renewal cycle. Due to these developments, we may experience additional expense accruals, increased insurance and claims expenses, and greater volatility in our insurance and claims expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We expect insurance and claims expense to continue to be volatile over the long-term. Recently the trucking industry has experienced a decline in the number of carriers and underwriters that write insurance policies or that are willing to provide insurance for trucking companies, however, for 2024, we expect insurance premiums expense to be similar to that of 2023.

Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of tractors, trailers, and other capital assets, as well as amortization of intangible assets. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 2.8 million and 10.7 million to 18.8 million and 57.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to 16.0 million and 46.6 million in the same 2023 periods, as a result of increased costs on new equipment and an increase in our average total tractor count. Amortization of intangible assets was 2.4 million and 7.1 million for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to 2.2 million and 5.1 million for the same 2023 periods. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the amortization of the intangible assets related to the Sims acquisitions and the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the LTST and Sims acquisitions. 
 
 We expect depreciation and amortization to increase going forward as the cost of new equipment increases and we see the full year effect of our 2023 equipment replacement plan. Additionally, changes in the used tractor market have caused us to adjust residual values and increase depreciation, and further adjustments may be necessary in the future. These changes may also cause us to hold assets longer than planned, or experience increased losses on sale. Successfully executing our plan to grow the Dedicated reportable segment could also increase depreciation and amortization going forward.

The change in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was insignificant both as a percentage of total revenue and freight revenue. For nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in revenue equipment installment notes as a result of additional equipment added during 2023 and 2024 as a result of our revenue equipment replacement plan, as well as increased interest rates since the 2023 periods. 
 
 This line item will fluctuate based on our decision with respect to purchasing revenue equipment with balance sheet debt versus operating leases, our revenue equipment replacement plan, and changing interest rates.

The decreases in TEL's contribution to our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of a deterioration in the equipment market, suppressing gains on sale of used equipment, and increased interest expense associated with higher interest rates on equipment related debt compared to the 2023 periods. Due to TEL's business model, gains and losses on sale of equipment is a normal part of the business and can cause earnings to fluctuate from period to period and therefore our income from investment to similarly fluctuate. We expect TEL's net income for the remainder of 2024 to decline compared that of the third quarter of 2024, resulting in a lower full year 2024 net income from TEL compared to full year 2023.

The decreases in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of a 0.8 million and 18.1 million decrease in pre-tax income, respectively, compared to the same 2023 periods. The decreases in pre-tax income resulted from the aforementioned changes in operating income and earnings on investment in TEL. 
 
 The effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due primarily to state tax expense and permanent differences. The rate impact of items such as executive compensation disallowance and the deductibility of per diem payments will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates.

The decrease in Expedited revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 4.8 , and a 4.8 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue compared to the 2023 quarter. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is the result of a 3.7 decrease in average miles per unit and a 3.0 cents per mile (or 1.2 decrease in average rate per total mile as compared to the 2023 quarter. Expedited team-driven tractors averaged 823 and 831 tractors in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the decrease in Expedited revenue relates to a decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 2.8 , and a 4.2 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 34 (or 3.9 average tractor increase compared to the same 2023 period. The decrease in average freight revenue per tractor per week for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of a 6.0 cents per mile (or 2.8 decrease in average rate per total mile partially offset by a 0.3 increase in average miles per unit compared to the same 2023 period. Expedited team-driven tractors averaged 837 and 801 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The increase in Dedicated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 relates to a 167, or 13.5 average tractor increase and an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 8.7 compared to the 2023 quarter. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week was the result of a 18.4 cents per mile (or 6.8 increase in average rate per total mile and a 1.8 increase in average miles per unit compared to the 2023 quarter. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the increase in Dedicated revenue relates to a 110 (or 8.9 average tractor increase and an increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week of 7.1 compared to the same 2023 period. The increase in average freight revenue per tractor per week for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of a 16.9 cents per mile (or 6.3 increase in average rate per total mile and a 1.1 increase in average miles per unit compared to the same 2023 period. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Managed Freight total revenue decreased primarily as a result of a degraded spot market, partially offset by the third quarter 2023 Sims acquisition. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Warehousing total revenue increased as a result of customer rate increases since the same 2023 periods. 
 
 The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of an 8.1 million, 5.0 million, and 0.9 million decrease in Expedited, Managed Freight, and Warehousing operating expenses, respectively, partially offset by a 12.0 million increase in Dedicated operating expenses and the decrease in total revenue described above. The decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was the result of a 38.2 million and 6.0 million increase in Dedicated and Expedited operating expenses, respectively, partially offset by an 8.4 million and 2.9 million decrease in Managed Freight and Warehousing operating expenses, as well as the aforementioned changes in total revenue. 
 
 The decrease in Expedited operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the aforementioned decreases in revenue and changes to the Expedited operating expenses. The decrease in Expedited operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a decrease in fuel expense and a decrease in operations and maintenance expenses as a compared to the same 2023 period, partially offset by a large workers' compensation claim during the 2024 period. The increase in Expedited operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to increases in insurance and claims expense, depreciation expense as a result of increased equipment cost, and losses on the sale of equipment since the 2023 period, partially offset by reductions in fuel expense and operations and maintenance expense. The increase in Dedicated operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in Dedicated operating expenses. The decrease in Dedicated operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in Dedicated operating expenses partially offset by the aforementioned increase in revenue. The increase in Dedicated operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was primarily the result of increased salaries, wages, and benefits for our professional drivers of 6.6 million and 13.9 million, respectively, as the result of growth, the increase in the contingent consideration liability of 0.7 million and 9.5 million, respectively, increased depreciation expense as a result of growth and increased equipment costs, and losses on the sale of equipment since the 2023 period. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we sold a Tennessee terminal resulting in a 7.6 million gain which is included in gain on disposition of property and equipment, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations with no similar gain in the same 2024 period. 
 
 The decrease in operating income for Managed Freight for the three months ended September 30, 2024was primarily the result of the aforementioned decreases in revenue partially offset by a decrease in Managed Freight operating expenses. The decrease in Managed Freight operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the changes in revenue driving changes in variable expenses, primarily purchased transportation, partially offset by a large cargo related claim during the 2024 period. The increase in operating income for Managed Freight for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of a decrease in Managed Freight operating expenses partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in revenue. The decrease in Managed Freight operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the changes in revenue driving changes in variable expenses, primarily purchased transportation, as well as a small number of prior period claims recognized in the same 2023 period with no similar 2024 activity. Additionally, operating income improved for both periods as a result of the impact of the higher-margin Sims acquisition since the same 2023 periods. 
 
 The increase in operating income for Warehousing for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in revenue and a decrease in Warehousing operating expenses. The decrease in Warehousing operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was a result of a reduction in outsourced labor since the 2023 periods. In our asset-light reportable segments, we are prioritizing long-term growth, focusing on talent acquisition and technology enhancements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our business requires significant capital investments over the short-term and the long-term. Historically, we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under our Credit Facility, cash flows from operations, long-term operating leases, finance leases, secured installment notes with finance companies, and proceeds from the sale of our used revenue equipment. Going forward, we expect revenue equipment acquisitions to primarily be through purchases and finance leases. Further, we expect to increase our capital allocation toward our Dedicated, Managed Freight, and Warehousing reportable segments to become the go-to partner for our customers most critical transportation and logistics needs. We had working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) of 20.1 million and 15.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our working capital on any particular day can vary significantly due to the timing of collections and cash disbursements. Based on our expected financial condition, net capital expenditures, results of operations, related net cash flows, installment notes, and other sources of financing, we believe our working capital and sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our current and projected needs, and we do not expect to experience material liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. 
 
 With an average tractor fleet age of 1.6 years at September 30, 2024, we believe we have flexibility to manage our fleet, and we plan to regularly evaluate our tractor replacement cycle, new tractor purchase requirements, and purchase options. If we were to grow our independent contractor fleet, our capital requirements would be reduced. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 316.5 million and 293.5 million in debt and lease obligations, respectively, consisting of the following: 

No and 11.6 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility; 

No outstanding borrowings under the Draw Note; 

247.4 million and 213.9 million in revenue equipment installment notes, respectively; 

18.1 million and 19.1 million in real estate notes, respectively; 

6.3 million and 6.1 million of the principal portion of financing lease obligations, respectively; and 

44.6 million and 42.8 million of the operating lease obligations, respectively. 

The increase in revenue equipment installment notes is primarily due to replacing our older equipment with new equipment as well as growth in our Dedicated reportable segment. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding, undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately 19.7 million, and available borrowing capacity of 90.3 million under the Credit Facility. Additionally, we had 45.0 million of remaining availability of a 45.0 million Draw Note from Triumph which is available solely to fund any indemnification owed to Triumph in relation to the TFS Settlement. Fluctuations in the outstanding balance and related availability under our Credit Facility are driven primarily by cash flows from operations and the timing and nature of property and equipment additions that are not funded through notes payable, as well as the nature and timing of collection of accounts receivable, payments of accrued expenses, and receipt of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. 
 
 Our net capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 77.5 million of expenditures, as compared to 143.0 million of expenditures for the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we took delivery of approximately 691 new tractors and 757 new trailers, while disposing of approximately 791 used tractors and 319 used trailers. Our current fleet plan for the remainder of 2024 includes the delivery of an additional 104 new company replacement tractors and 93 additional new trailer deliveries. Net losses on disposal of equipment and real estate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.7 million compared to 12.4 million net gains in the same prior year period primarily due to the 7.6 million gain on a Tennessee terminal during the 2023 period and the aforementioned disposal of revenue equipment as part of our trade cycle. For the balance of 2024, our baseline expectation for net capital expenditures is 15.0 million to 20.0 million. Our capital investment plan reflects our priorities of maintaining the average age of our fleet in a manner that allows us to optimize operational uptime and related operating costs, and offering a fleet of equipment that our professional drivers are proud to operate. We expect the benefits of improved utilization, fuel economy and maintenance costs to produce acceptable returns despite increased prices of new equipment and potentially lower values of used equipment. 
 
 We distributed a total of 4.3 million to stockholders in the first nine months of 2024 through dividends. 
 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, and we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of potential short-term and long-term impacts to our business.

Cash Flows 
 
 Despite a year over year reduction in net income of 13.2 million, net cash flows provided by operating activities increased to 101.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.9 million for the same 2023 period, primarily due to increases in non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and reductions to non-cash gains on sale of property and equipment in the current period. Changes in operating assets and liabilities such as receivables and driver advances and insurance and claims accruals provided improved cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the 2023 period. 
 
 Net cash flows used by investing activities were 104.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 144.6 million used in the same 2023 period. The decrease in net cash flows used by investing activities was primarily due to the April 2023 and the August 2023 acquisitions of LTST and Sims, respectively, for 107.9 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by the 4.6 million payment related to the acquisition of LTST and our Section 338(h)(10) election during the 2024 period, and the timing of our trade cycle whereby we took delivery of approximately 691 new tractors and 757 new trailers, while disposing of approximately 791 used tractors and 319 used trailers during the 2024 period compared to delivery of 607 new tractors and 367 new trailers, while disposing of approximately 926 used tractors and 518 used trailers in the same 2023 period. Additionally, the 2023 period provided 12.5 million of proceeds related to the sale of a Tennessee terminal. 
 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately 36.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30.4 million provided in the same 2023 period. The increase in net cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily a function of no repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock during the 2024 period compared to 25.4 million during the same 2023 period, partially offset by net proceeds relating to our notes payable and our Credit Facility of 47.3 million in the 2024 period compared to 76.9 million in the 2023 period. 
 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities and provided by financing activities in the 2024 period also included payment of 3.0 million and 7.0 million, respectively, of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of AAT. Net cash flows provided by operating activities and provided by financing activities in the 2023 period also included payment of 0.8 million and 9.2 million, respectively, of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of AAT. 
 
 On May 18, 2022 our Board approved a stock repurchase authorization of up to 75.0 million of our Class A common stock, with any remaining amount available under prior authorizations being excluded and no longer available. Under such authorization, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock for 54.7 million during 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to the Company's stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate 55.0 million of our Class A common stock. The amendment added an incremental approximately 37.5 million to the approximately 17.5 million that was then-remaining under the program. Between May 2022 and April 2023, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. The program expired on January 31, 2024. 
 
 Our cash flows may fluctuate depending on capital expenditures, future stock repurchases, dividends, strategic investments or divestitures, any indemnification calls related to the TFS Settlement, and the extent of future income tax obligations and refunds.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those anticipated. There have been no material changes to our most critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to those disclosed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our market risks have not changed materially from the market risks reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving its control objectives. 
 
 We have confidence in our internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure procedures and controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all our control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
