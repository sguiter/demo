Overview We believe that Boot Barn is the largest lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories in the U.S. As of September 28, 2024, we operated 425 stores in 46 states, as well as our e-commerce websites consisting primarily of bootbarn.com, sheplers.com, countryoutfitter.com, idyllwind.com and third-party marketplaces, as well as the Boot Barn app. Our product offering is anchored by an extensive selection of western and work boots and is complemented by a wide assortment of coordinating apparel and accessories. Our stores feature a comprehensive assortment of brands and styles, coupled with attentive, knowledgeable store associates. Many of the items that we offer are basics or necessities for our customers daily lives and typically represent enduring styles that are not meaningfully impacted by changing fashion trends.

Table of Contents 
 We strive to offer an authentic, one-stop shopping experience that fulfills the everyday lifestyle needs of our customers, and as a result, many of our customers make purchases in both the western and work wear sections of our stores. We target a broad and growing demographic, ranging from passionate western and country enthusiasts, to workers seeking dependable, high-quality footwear and apparel. Our broad geographic footprint, which comprises more than four times as many stores as our nearest direct competitor that sells primarily western and work wear, provides us with significant economies of scale, enhanced supplier relationships, the ability to recruit and retain high quality store associates and the ability to reinvest in our business at levels that we believe exceed those of our competition. How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators that we use to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business are net sales and gross profit. In addition, we also review other important metrics, such as same store sales, new store openings, and selling, general and administrative SG A expenses, and operating income. Net sales Net sales reflect revenue from the sale of our merchandise at retail locations, as well as sales of merchandise through our e-commerce websites and app. We recognize revenue upon the purchase of merchandise by customers at our stores and upon delivery of the product in the case of our e-commerce websites and app. Net sales also include shipping and handling fees for e-commerce shipments that have been delivered to our customers. Net sales are net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for estimated future award redemptions. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred until the gift cards are used to purchase merchandise. Our business is moderately seasonal, and as a result, our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter. In addition, our revenues in any given quarter can be affected by a number of factors, including the timing of holidays, weather patterns, rodeos and country concerts. The third quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the Christmas shopping season, has historically produced higher sales and disproportionately larger operating income than the other quarters of our fiscal year. However, neither the western nor the work component of our business has been meaningfully impacted by fashion trends or seasonality historically. We believe that many of our customers are driven primarily by utility and brand, and our best-selling styles. Same store sales The term same store sales generally refers to net sales from stores that have been open at least 13 full fiscal months comparable stores as of the end of the current reporting period, although we include or exclude stores from our calculation of same store sales in accordance with the following additional criteria : stores that are closed for five or fewer consecutive days in any fiscal month are included in same store sales; stores that are closed temporarily, but for more than five consecutive days in any fiscal month, are excluded from same store sales beginning in the fiscal month in which the temporary closure begins (and for the comparable periods of the prior or subsequent fiscal periods for comparative purposes) until the first full month of operation once the store re-opens; stores that are closed temporarily and relocated within their respective trade areas are included in same store sales; stores that are permanently closed are excluded from same store sales beginning in the month preceding closure (and for the comparable periods of the prior or subsequent fiscal periods for comparative purposes); and acquired stores are added to same store sales beginning on the later of (a) the applicable acquisition date and (b) the first day of the first fiscal month after the store has been open for at least 13 full fiscal months, regardless of whether the store has been operated under our management or predecessor management. If the criteria described with respect to acquired stores above are met, then all net sales of such acquired store, excluding those net sales before our acquisition of that store, are included for the period presented. However, when an acquired store is included for the period presented, the net sales of such acquired store for periods before its acquisition are included (to the extent relevant) for purposes of calculating same store sales growth and illustrating the comparison 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 between the applicable periods. Pre-acquisition net sales numbers are derived from the books and records of the acquired company, as prepared prior to the acquisition, and are not been independently verified by us. In addition to retail store sales, same store sales also include e-commerce sales, e-commerce shipping and handling revenue and actual retail store or e-commerce sales returns. Sales as a result of an e-commerce asset acquisition are excluded from same store sales until the 13th full fiscal month subsequent to the Company s acquisition of such assets. We exclude gift card escheatment, provision for sales returns and estimated future loyalty award redemptions from sales in our calculation of net sales per store. Measuring the change in year-over-year same store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing. Numerous factors affect our same store sales, including: national and regional economic trends; our ability to identify and respond effectively to regional consumer preferences; changes in our product mix; changes in pricing; competition; changes in the timing of promotional and advertising efforts; holidays or seasonal periods; and weather. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy, and we anticipate that a percentage of our net sales in the near future will come from stores not included in our same store sales calculation. Accordingly, same store sales are only one measure that we use to assess the success of our business and growth strategy. Some of our competitors and other retailers may calculate same or comparable store sales differently than we do. As a result, data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our same store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. New store openings New store openings reflect the number of stores, excluding acquired stores, that are opened during a particular reporting period. In connection with opening new stores, we incur pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs consist of costs incurred prior to opening a new store and primarily consist of manager and other employee payroll, travel and training costs, marketing expenses, initial opening supplies and costs of transporting initial inventory and certain fixtures to store locations, as well as occupancy costs incurred from the time that we take possession of a store site to the opening of that store. Occupancy costs are included in cost of goods sold, and the other pre-opening costs are included in SG A expenses. All of these costs are expensed as incurred. New stores often open with a period of high sales levels, which subsequently decrease to normalized sales volumes. In addition, we experience typical inefficiencies in the form of higher labor, advertising and other direct operating expenses, and as a result, store-level profit margins at our new stores are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The number and timing of store openings has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations. In assessing the performance of a new store, we review its actual sales against the sales that we projected that store to achieve at the time we initially approved its opening. We also review the actual number of stores opened in a fiscal year against the number of store openings that we included in our budget at the beginning of that fiscal year. Gross profit Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise, obsolescence and shrinkage provisions, store and distribution center occupancy costs (including rent, depreciation and utilities), inbound and outbound freight, supplier allowances, occupancy-related taxes, compensation costs for merchandise purchasing, exclusive brand design and development, distribution center personnel, and other inventory acquisition-related costs. These costs are significant and can be expected to continue to increase as we grow. The 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 components of our reported cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other retail companies, including our competitors. Our gross profit generally follows changes in net sales. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, as well as gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Specifically, we examine the initial markup on purchases, markdowns and reserves, shrinkage, buying costs, distribution costs and occupancy costs. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups, a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrinkage, or a significant increase in freight and other inventory acquisition costs, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations. Gross profit is also impacted by shifts in the proportion of sales of our exclusive brand products compared to third-party brand products, as well as by sales mix changes within and between brands and major product categories such as footwear, apparel or accessories. Selling, general and administrative expenses Our SG A expenses are composed of labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and general and administrative expenses not included in cost of goods sold. Specifically, our SG A expenses include the following: Labor and related expenses - Labor and related expenses include all store-level salaries and hourly labor costs, including salaries, wages, benefits and performance incentives, labor taxes and other indirect labor costs. Other operating expenses - Other operating expenses include all operating costs, including those for advertising, pay-per-click, marketing campaigns, operating supplies, certain utilities, and repairs and maintenance, as well as credit card fees and costs of third-party services. General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our stores, including compensation and benefits, travel expenses, corporate occupancy costs, stock compensation costs, legal and professional fees, insurance, long-lived asset impairment charges and other related corporate costs. The components of our SG A expenses may not be comparable to those of our competitors and other retailers. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as a result of incremental stock-based compensation, legal, and accounting-related expenses and increases resulting from growth in the number of our stores. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the Fiscal 2024 10-K. Certain of our accounting policies and estimates are considered critical, as these policies and estimates are the most important to the depiction of our consolidated financial statements and require significant, difficult or complex judgments, often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Fiscal 2024 10-K. As of the date of this filing, there were no significant changes to any of the critical accounting policies and estimates described in the Fiscal 2024 10-K. Results of Operations We operate on a fiscal calendar that results in a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of March unless April 1st is a Saturday, in which case the fiscal year ends on April 1st. In a 52-week fiscal year, each quarter includes thirteen weeks of operations; in a 53-week fiscal year, the first, second and third quarters each include thirteen weeks of operations and the fourth quarter includes fourteen weeks of operations. Both the current fiscal year ending on March 29, 2025 fiscal 2025 and the fiscal year ended on March 30, 2024 fiscal 2024 consist of 52 weeks.

Net sales increased 51.3 million, or 13.7 , to 425.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 374.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated same store sales increased 4.9 . Excluding the impact of the 10.1 increase in e-commerce same store sales, same store sales increased by 4.3 . The increase in net sales was the result of incremental sales from new stores and the increase in consolidated same store sales. Gross profit. Gross profit increased 18.9 million, or 14.1 , to 152.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 133.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased by 10 basis points to 35.9 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 35.8 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit increased primarily due to an increase in sales and merchandise margin, partially offset by the occupancy costs of new stores. The increase in gross profit rate of 10 basis points was driven primarily by a 70 basis-point increase in merchandise margin rate, partially offset by 60 basis points of deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs. The increase in merchandise margin rate was primarily the result of supply chain efficiencies, while the deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs was driven by the occupancy of new stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses increased 17.6 million, or 18.4 , to 112.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 95.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior-year period was primarily a result of higher store payroll and store-related expenses associated with operating more stores, incentive-based compensation, marketing expenses, and legal expenses in the current year. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased by 100 basis points to 26.5 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 25.5 for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation, legal expenses, and marketing expenses in the current year, partially offset by lower store payroll expenses. Income from operations. Income from operations increased 1.4 million, or 3.6 , to 40.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 38.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income from operations was attributable to the factors noted above. As a percentage of net sales, income from operations was 9.4 and 10.3 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense. Interest expense was 0.4 million and 0.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in the current-year period was primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in the current year. Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 11.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 10.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 27.4 and 27.3 for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 was consistent with the tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. Net income. Net income was 29.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 27.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the factors noted above. Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Net sales. Net sales increased 91.0 million, or 12.0 , to 849.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 758.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. Consolidated same store sales increased 3.1 . Excluding the impact of the 8.4 increase in e-commerce same store sales, same store sales increased by 2.5 . The increase in net sales was the result of incremental sales from new stores and the increase in consolidated same store sales. Gross profit. Gross profit increased 33.7 million, or 12.2 , to 309.6 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 275.9 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased by 10 basis points to 36.5 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 36.4 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit increased primarily due to an increase in sales and merchandise margin, partially offset by the occupancy costs of new stores. The increase in gross profit rate of 10 basis points was driven primarily by an 80 basis-point increase in merchandise margin rate, partially offset by 70 basis points of deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs. The increase in merchandise margin rate was the result of supply chain efficiencies, while the deleverage in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs was driven primarily by the occupancy of new stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses increased 28.3 million, or 14.8 , to 219.4 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 191.1 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior-year period was primarily a result of higher store payroll and store-related expenses associated with operating more stores, marketing expenses, and incentive-based compensation in the current year. As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased by 60 basis points to 25.8 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 25.2 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation and marketing expenses in the current year, partially offset by lower store payroll and store-related expenses.

 Income from operations. Income from operations increased 5.4 million, or 6.3 , to 90.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 from 84.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income from operations was attributable to the factors noted above. As a percentage of net sales, income from operations was 10.6 and 11.2 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense. Interest expense was 0.7 million and 1.5 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in the current-year period was primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in the current year. Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 22.7 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 21.6 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 24.9 and 25.8 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The tax rate for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 was lower than the tax rate for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher tax benefit caused by an increase in tax deductions for share-based compensation awards for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 and changes to state enacted tax rates for the period ended September 30, 2023. Net income. Net income was 68.3 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 61.9 million for the twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the factors noted above. Store Operating Data: The following table presents store operating data for the periods indicated: 

Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Selected Store Data: Same Store Sales growth/(decline) 4.9 (4.8) 3.1 (3.8) Stores operating at end of period 425 371 425 371 Comparable stores open during period 363 312 363 312 Total retail store selling square footage, end of period (in thousands) 4,720 4,027 4,720 4,027 Average retail store selling square footage, end of period 11,105 10,855 11,105 10,855 Average sales per comparable store (in thousands) (1) 952 950 1,894 1,924 

 (1) Average sales per comparable store is calculated by dividing comparable store trailing three-month or six-month sales for the applicable period by the number of comparable stores operating during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources We rely on cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility as our primary sources of liquidity. Our primary cash needs are for inventories, operating expenses, occupancy expenses, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores and remodeling or refurbishing existing stores, improvements to our distribution facilities, marketing and information technology expenditures, debt service and taxes. We have historically used cash for acquisitions and the subsequent rebranding and integration of the stores acquired in those acquisitions. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the most significant components of our working capital are accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 availability of cash under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and other anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. Our liquidity is moderately seasonal. Our cash requirements generally increase in our third fiscal quarter as we increase our inventory in advance of the Christmas shopping season. We are planning to continue to open new stores, remodel and refurbish our existing stores, and make improvements to our e-commerce and information technology infrastructure, which will result in increased capital expenditures. Included in our fiscal 2025 capital expenditures are continued investments in our new distribution center in Kansas City, Missouri. We estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 will be between 115.0 million and 120.0 million (including the capital expenditures made during the twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024), which is net of estimated landlord tenant allowances of 30.2 million. We anticipate that we will use cash flows from operations to fund these expenditures. Wells Fargo Revolver The Company has a 250.0 million syndicated senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the Wells Fargo Revolver for which Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is agent Wells Fargo ). Under the Wells Fargo Revolver, the sublimit for letters of credit is 10.0 million, and the maturity date is July 11, 2027. Revolving credit loans under the Wells Fargo Revolver bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at the Company s option, either (i) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (defined as Term SOFR for the applicable interest period plus a fixed credit spread adjustment of 0.10 plus an applicable margin for Term SOFR loans, or (ii) the base rate plus an applicable margin for base rate loans. The base rate is calculated at the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 , (b) the Wells Fargo prime rate and (c) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.0 . The applicable margin is calculated based on a pricing grid that in each case is linked to quarterly average excess availability. For Term SOFR loans, the applicable margin ranges from 1.00 to 1.25 , and for base rate loans it ranges from 0.00 to 0.25 . The interest on base rate loans under the Wells Fargo Revolver is payable in quarterly installments ending on the maturity date and for Term SOFR loans is payable on the earlier of the last day of each interest period applicable thereto, or on each three-month interval of such interest period. The Company also pays a commitment fee of 0.25 per annum of the actual daily amount of the unutilized revolving loans. The borrowing base of the Wells Fargo Revolver is calculated on a monthly basis and is based on the amount of eligible credit card receivables, commercial accounts, inventory, and available reserves. The amounts outstanding under the Wells Fargo Revolver and letter of credit commitments as of September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024 were zero and 2.3 million, respectively. Total interest expense incurred on the Wells Fargo Revolver during the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 0.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 was 8.5 . Total interest expense incurred on the Wells Fargo Revolver during the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended September 30, 2023 was 0.3 million and 1.2 million, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 was 8.2 . All obligations under the Wells Fargo Revolver are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and each of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries), which are not named as borrowers under the Wells Fargo Revolver. The Wells Fargo Revolver contains customary provisions relating to mandatory prepayments, restricted payments, voluntary payments, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. In addition, the terms of the Wells Fargo Revolver require the Company to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Wells Fargo Revolver) of at least 1.00:1.00 during such times as a covenant trigger event shall exist. The Wells Fargo Revolver also requires the Company to pay additional interest of 2.0 per annum upon triggering certain specified events of default set forth therein.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Ris k We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our credit facility which bears interest at variable rates. As of September 28, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Wells Fargo Revolver. As of September 28, 2024, there were no other material changes in the market risks described in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks section of the Fiscal 2024 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedure s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures , as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, no changes occurred with respect to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Part II. Other Informatio n Item 1. Legal Proceeding s For information on legal proceedings, see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies , to our unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
