in inventory valued at cost. Inventory is finished goods excluding freight costs. The Company periodically
reviews its inventories and makes a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are
damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based
upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions
result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of its inventory below its previous estimate, the Company would increase its
reserve in the period in which it made such a determination. 

In
addition, the Company provides for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventory counts. Inventory shrinkage
estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. The Company performs physical inventory counts and cycle counts
throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has no obsolescence provisions,
damage provisions, or shrinkage provisions. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. The
Company s cash, which is carried at fair value, is classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The Company s bank accounts
are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. 

Accordingly,
the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts are satisfied. Our performance obligations
primarily consist of delivering products to our customers. Control is transferred upon providing the products to customers upon shipment
of our products to the consumers from our ecommerce sites. Once control is transferred to the customer, we have completed our performance
obligation.

On
October 17, 2024, LSEB Creative Corp entered into a consulting agreement (the Consulting Agreement with Beyond Media Group
LLC., a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Wyoming Beyond Media to provide marketing and advertising
services to communicate information about the Company and the Lauren Bentley Swimwear brand to the financial community including but
not limited to, creating company profiles, media distribution, and building a digital community with respect to the Company. 

Pursuant
to the Consulting Agreement, the Company agrees to compensate Beyond Media up to 250,000 with periodic payments over a period of three
(3) months, unless otherwise extended by mutual agreement of the parties, commencing October 17, 2024. The
Company has paid a fee of approximately 15,000 as of the date of this release for the services to Beyond Media, and additional funds
are expected to be paid as necessary. 

The
Company has the right to terminate the Consulting Agreement at any time with or without cause, at which point the Company will not be
entitled to a return of any paid compensation. Beyond Media will rely solely on the Company s previously disclosed public information
such as all SEC filings, Company s press releases, and the Company s corporate web-site including resource materials. 

As
of the date hereof, to the best of the Company s knowledge, Beyond Media (including its directors and officers) does not own any
securities of the Company and has an arm s length relationship with the Company. The Company will not issue any securities to Beyond
Media as compensation for its services. 

MARKETING
ACTIVITIES, NOMINAL FLOAT AND SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS MAY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. 

We
expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness
for the Company. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which
our business practices are described. We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings
and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning the Company. We will not
be responsible for the content of analyst reports and other writings and communications by investor relations firms not authored by the
Company or from publicly available information. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts reports or
other materials based upon analysts own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are
compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors in the
Company may be willing, from time to time, to encourage investor awareness through similar activities. Investor awareness activities
may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our common stock. 

The
SEC and OTC Markets Group Inc. OTC Markets enforce various statutes and regulations intended to prevent manipulative
or deceptive devices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security and carefully scrutinize trading patterns and company news
and other communications for false or misleading information, particularly in cases where the hallmarks of pump and dump 
activities may exist, such as rapid share price increases or decreases. The Supreme Court has stated that manipulative action is a term
of art connoting intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the
price of securities. Often times, manipulation is associated by regulators with forces that upset the supply and demand factors that
would normally determine trading prices. Securities regulators have often cited thinly-traded markets, small numbers of holders, and
awareness campaigns as components of their claims of price manipulation and other violations of law when combined with manipulative trading,
such as wash sales, matched orders or other manipulative trading timed to coincide with false or touting press releases. There can be
no assurance that the Company s or third-parties activities, or the small number of potential sellers or small percentage
of stock in the float, or determinations by purchasers or holders as to when or under what circumstances or at what prices
they may be willing to buy or sell stock will not artificially impact (or would be claimed by regulators to have affected) the normal
supply and demand factors that determine the price of the stock.

Item 2. 
 Management s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements
are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and
our assumptions. Words such as anticipate, expects, intends, plans, believes, 
 seeks and estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some
of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
forecasted in the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only
as of the date of this Form 10-Q. Investors should carefully consider all of such risks before making an investment decision with respect
to the Company s stock. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and summary of selected financial data for LSEB Creative Corp. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management. 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of
the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial
statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases,
the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment
in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce
a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

We
intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain
key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting
principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying
notes for the year ended March 31, 2024, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the
SEC on July 16, 2024. 

Overview 

LSEB
Creative Corp., was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on April 3, 2019. On August 3, 2023, the Company incorporated its wholly-owned
subsidiary 1000615000 Ontario Corp, an Ontario corporation, and on September 12, 2023 filed articles of amendment to changed its name
to LSEB Creative Corp (Ontario). 

The
Company is a specialty retailer that offers men and women elevated swimwear designs, constructed with the highest quality materials and
techniques. With the recent substantial growth seen in the swimwear industry, our affluent, contemporary target market is in search of
assortment and impressive concepts. By offering a new concept to swimwear; gender-coordinating collections that allow the wearer to look
and feel powerful, partnered or individually, we will capture this new, sought-after space within the market. Our priority is to design
products that offer superior fit, performance, and comfort while incorporating both function and fashionability. Our strategy is to capitalize
on these existing opportunities in the luxury swimwear market through the development and growth of our web site www.laurenbentleyswim.com ,
and wholesaler partnerships on a global scale. We believe eCommerce will allow our target market convenient and easy access to our products
while effectively building brand awareness and entry into new markets. We are committed to building a highly recognized brand, offering
captivating customer experiences that drive long-term loyalty. By focusing on these key areas and tactics, we will successfully align
ourselves with our target market and profit accordingly. 

We
are confident in our ability to operate cost efficiently and compete in a highly saturated market by addressing the observed opportunity.
LSEB will capture a new space within the market, which is in need of innovation and quality options. Majority of existing swimwear brands
have similar strategies, providing consumers with trend-driven styles and fair quality at a mid-high tier price bracket, representing
a similar structure to fast fashion. Focusing on luxury swimwear items for both men and women, LSEB s collection will embody it s
affluent, contemporary target market entirely. The individual men s and women s sub-collections will be coordinating, as
the partnered portion of our target market values looking well put-together as a couple, as well as individually. The physical presence
of our collection has the following defining attributes; fine details and finishings, alluring silhouettes, coordinating pieces between
the men s and women s sub-collections. 

4 

LSEB s
designs are highly influenced by ready-to-wear fashions. Our intention is that individually, our designs are versatile enough that they
can exceed their intended purpose; swimming and lounging, making appearances in the customer s daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest
quality in fabrics, hardware and embellishments, LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process for each individually item. Newest technologies
in fabrics and manufacturing will be utilized in design and production stages, and may include technologies such as, quick drying finishes
or shapewear fabric. From goods to packaging and labeling, the brand identity has been absolutely thought through and is evident across
all areas. 

Our
mission is to become a single source of innovative luxury swimwear for our target market. The Company has recognized the sales and profit
potential of luxury swimwear for men and women, as consumers are willing to invest in the swimwear category and seek new brands and product
assortment. We strive to offer consumers the highest quality products with a new fashion-forward, innovative outlook to swim fashion. 

LSEB
is dedicated to being a dominant provider of luxury swimwear globally, and known for: 

Highest
 quality products and services 

Accurate,
 efficient and quality customer service 

Honesty,
 integrity and continually adding value to its customers, partners and associates. 

From
inception to September 30, 2024 we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 641,870. Based on our financial history since inception,
our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has recently commenced sales,
but has limited operating history. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to raise adequate
financing and develop profitable operations. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues from our services, we may have to delay the implementation
of our business plan. Management is actively targeting sources of additional financing to provide continuation of the Company s
operations and growth. In order for the Company to meet its liabilities as they come due and to continue its operations, the Company
is solely dependent upon its ability to generate such financing. 

The
Company is actively seeking financing for its current business operation. The Company is optimistic that the financing will be secured
and the going concern risk will be removed. Any capital raised will be through a private placement and will result in the issuance of
shares of common stock from the Company s authorized capital.

expansion. Our campaign-focused marketing programs are designed to reinforce the premium image of our brand and our connection with consumers. 

Introduce

We

Broaden
the Appeal of our Products 

We
will selectively seek opportunities to expand the appeal of our swimwear line and improve productivity to increase our overall market
share. This includes our post launch plans to expand our product offering in categories such as beachwear and men s daywear. 

Operations 

Product 

Our
product design and development efforts are led by Lauren Bentley and include a team of designers based in the US and abroad who are dedicated
to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the
input of our target market and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of fit, style and function superiority. As we strive
to provide our customers with intricately designed and skillfully constructed garments, our team works closely with our suppliers to
ensure specifications are reached. We will partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety
of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including retention, abrasion resistance, colorfastness, and sun damage.
We offer premium swimwear that is optimized for fit, comfort, functionality and style. By combining functionality with elevated design,
our brand not only has strong consumer appeal, but also attracts a growing core of consumers that desire swimwear suited to their lifestyles.
We believe our superior quality and technically advanced products allow us to maintain premium price points and encourage repeat purchases
among our customers. 

Design
and Styling 

Focusing
on luxury swimwear items for both men and women, LSEB s collection will embody it s affluent, contemporary target market
entirely. The individual men s and women s sub-collections will be coordinating, as the partnered portion of our target market
values looking well put-together as a couple. The physical presence of our collection has the following defining attributes; fine details
and finishings, alluring silhouettes, coordinating pieces, and a runway-ready look. The designs are highly influenced by ready-to-wear
fashions Our intention is that individually, our designs are versatile enough that they can exceed their intended purpose - swimming
and lounging, making appearances in the customer s daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest quality in fabrics, hardware and embellishments,
LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process for all items individually. Newest technologies in fabrics and manufacturing will be utilized
in design and production stages, and may include technologies such as, quick drying finishes or shapewear fabric. From goods to packaging
and labeling, the brand identity has been absolutely thought through and is evident across all areas. 

Adjustability,
Fit, and Sizing 

We
believe the authenticity of our products is driven by a number of factors. These factors include our inspired design process, our use
of technical materials, our sophisticated manufacturing methods and our innovative product features. 

LSEB
is wholly committed to developing garments that enhance the customer s body, evoking feelings of empowerment and boldness. Technologically
advanced fabrics, techniques, and adjustable features, will collectively result in a truly tailored fit, unmatched by anyone. 

7 

Women s 

Adjustability
functions that appear in some of our women s designs include adjustable shoulder straps, tie-back straps, and hook eye bra
closures. Additional notable fir features include shapewear inserts, underwire or floating underwire to give added support, and molded
cups. Each women s SKU is designed and constructed with the intention of enhancing the female figure. Sizing scales to vary based
upon individual styles but will categorize as one of the following; numeric sizing (Ex: 2-18) or bra sizing (Ex: 32B/C 38 B/C). 

Men s 

Our
goal is not to reconstruct, but to enhance the fit and styling of men s swimwear currently on the market. We believe that men desire
and deserve a perfectly fitting swim garment, just as women do. An example our improvements includes the addition of hidden, inner drawstring
to our swim trunks, which will reinforce the zipper and snap closure, ensuring security during use. Other styles include waist fasteners
on either side of the body, which allow the wearer to further adjust the garment, creating a tailored fit. Our technologically advanced
stretch net lining conforms to the body without restriction for optimal comfort. Along with these features, our size offering, which
will be numeric (Ex: 26-40) and inseam length options (Ex: 4.5 or 6.5 ), will provide the perfect fit for every man. 

Since
September 30, 2024, and for the next 6 months during our fiscal year 2025, our business will be built across four key growth product
categories including: (1) Women s Swimwear, (2) Men s Swimwear, (3) Women s Beachwear, and (4) Accessories. Our growth
plan is to achieve 500,000 in net revenues within the 12 months following fiscal quarter end September 30, 2024, with majority derived
from category (1), Women s Swimwear. The Company launched the brand in October 2023 with men s and women s swimwear,
and we have started generating revenue. The Company plans to complete a financing through a private offering for a minimum of 400,000
within the 6-12 months following our September 30, 2024 quarter end. We have not yet entered into any agreements with any parties
with respect to obtaining financing for the Company. 

We
intend to target consumers with on-line marketing, and businesses, including hotels and independent boutiques with direct mail, and pursuing
contacts within the industry. The Company also expects to attend swimwear trade shows across the world. 

If
we are unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms, we could be forced to delay or scale back our plans for expansion. In addition,
such inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition. In the unlikely scenario that we are not successful in financing our target of 400,000 or above through a private offering
within the first 6-12-months following our September 30, 2024 quarter-end we will delay the launch of the Women s Beachwear, and
continue moving forward solely with Men s and Women s Swimwear. 

Within
18 months following our September 30, 2024 quarter-end, our total sales forecast is 1,200,000. This target is comprised of 1,000,000
Women s Swimwear and Men s Swimwear categories, and 200,000 Beachwear and Accessories. We anticipate a sales growth rate
of approximately 50 per year for our first 3 operational years. 

The
Company has executed all essential functions, including but not limited to, collection design, technical illustrations and specification,
sourcing trims, fabrics, and yarn, sample making, pattern drafting, manufacturer bulk order placement, and various marketing projects.
The Company has received its bulk production from its factory in September 2023 and the Company launched the brand in October 2023. These
functions have allowed the Company to launch its B2C distribution channel, and the Company is focusing on B2B wholesale partnerships
for additional growth opportunities. Additionally, the Company s B2C launch will allow the Company to achieve an average target
margin of 55-65 across our four key product categories. 

As
of our quarter end September 30, 2024, the Company has completed a number of the essential functions outlined above. Our first collection,
which has launched in October 2023 in conjunction with the brand s ecommerce site, has been designed and technical illustrations
have been completed. For the Company s second collection, our technical packages, which includes the technical sketches and all
specifications on measurements, construction, trim and fabric Bill of Materials, and all additional information the manufacturing company
will need, have been completed by an outsourced Technical Designer. This subsequent
women s collection is comprised of six styles in three colorways. The collection has been developed in alignment with our notable quality
standard, made possible with the strategic partnership made with the manufacturer. The design ethos of this collection embraces subtle
fashion characteristics, effortlessly transitioning from the elevated basics that defined the brand s well-received leading collection.
This release is eagerly anticipated and will mark a significant milestone in the brand s evolution, further solidifying Lauren Bentley
Swimwear s position in the luxury swimwear market. 

8 

The
Company has received the sample sets for the second collection from the factory and we expect to launch the second collection in January
2025. A significant amount of focus went into the sourcing of collection trims and fabric, as well as brand packaging and labeling. The
Company believes in sourcing based on quality, not ease, in order to develop superior product. Thus, all items are sourced from various
countries and factories depending on capabilities, skills, and technologies. For our first and second collection, majority of items have
been sourced from specialized, established suppliers in Italy, France, and Spain. 

In
September 2024, the Company began research and design stages of expanding its beachwear
category, with an emphasis on versatile, high-quality pieces. Lauren Bentley Swimwear intends to introduce cover-ups such as sarongs,
a quintessential element of women s beachwear wardrobes. This versatile item is currently being developed by the brand s design team
with the help of supply and manufacturer partners. Additional cover-ups and new product categories are entering the research and design
stages. These steps further solidifying Lauren Bentley Swimwear s vision to become a comprehensive beachwear lifestyle brand. While these
category expansions are an exciting development, the brand is aiming for a release in Spring 2025, though no definitive timeline has
been established. As with all Lauren Bentley Swimwear offerings, the brand remains committed to prioritizing quality throughout the meticulous
design, development, and sourcing processes. 

The
marketing mix is of large focus for the Company, as we understand the importance of marketing within the luxury market and its role in
building brand recognition and credibility. For this reason, we have decided to utilize a third-party, bespoke marketing agency based
out of London, England. Completed initial marketing projects include; the branding package, which includes the primary logo, secondary
logo, and submark, in addition to the overall brand, story and packaging designs; and ecommerce website development. The Company is on
track with all necessary functions in order to meet deadlines and ultimately, all established Company goals. 

LSEB
Creative has built a comprehensive paid advertising initiative targeting both North American and international markets. Utilizing major
platforms such as Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Pinterest, and Google, the Company aims to significantly broaden the brand s audience
reach. Lauren Bentley Swimwear has previously trialed select paid advertising strategies, yielding valuable insights into customer behavior
and optimal campaign performance. With this foundational knowledge, the Company is ready to scale up its advertising efforts in North
America while simultaneously expanding into key markets in Western Europe and Asia. This strategic push comes as part of the Company s
continued focus on enhancing brand growth, engagement, and market expansion. The
campaign will consist of a balanced mix of conversion ads aimed at driving sales, complemented by brand awareness initiatives to reinforce
LBS s positioning. The primary focus of the campaign will be on ads that offer brand storytelling and increased visibility, while a secondary
emphasis will be placed on conversion-driven ads. 

 LSEB
Creative Corp. intends to remain agile throughout the campaign by monitoring performance metrics closely and refining strategies as necessary
to align with customer preferences and maximize returns. 

Initial
distribution will be B2C via our ecommerce website, which will allow us to bypass middlemen and margin loss. Our ecommerce website, as
well as our social media pages, has been prepared by a third-party marketing agency. Preparation of these areas of our marketing mix
include, website development and testing, product photography, campaign photography and videography, copywriting, and SEO management.
Additionally, these projects, along with our branding package, will lend themselves to all areas of the marketing mix. Marketing strategies
has commenced across all platforms as a tactic to create excitement around the brand and products. Our ecommerce website laurenbentleyswim.com
is now live for purchasing. 

All
steps of the process have been completed in accordance with the fashion calendar with our first collection released in October 2023.
This is essential to ensure consistent product offering and Company sales forecast is met. 

Onward,
product launches will continue to be developed and released based on the fashion calendar, with key deliveries falling in January/February,
May/June, and October/November. The Company will consider expanding SKU assortment and product categories based on consumer demand and
feedback. The Company believes that when expanding the product offering, doing so organically is essential to long-term growth and sales
plans. 

Since
the Company s launch in October 2023, we will commence two key growth strategies; building a full-time team of staff and nurturing
wholesale partnerships. We believe organically growing a team of full-time employees is essential in the future success of the business.
Employees will be hired based on their suitability in the role and connection with the brand. We will take our time hiring the right
person for each individual position as it is needed. By having a full-time team, we will gain the contacts, knowhow, manpower, and consistency
needed to operate a successful luxury fashion brand. 

Entering
wholesale distribution opportunities will allow the Company to grow reach within key markets, sales, and brand recognition. The Company
intends on partnering with top luxury retailers across North America and Europe, as well as particular independent retailers and hotel
boutiques. The Company currently maintains relationships with targeted retailers but believes entering wholesale distribution will have
the highest growth potential once the brand is established with sales to show. The partnerships we create will be strategically chosen
based on brand values, style, price point, and expectations. We believe that by progressing into wholesale distribution will allow us
to increase sales by approximately 50 consistently through year one to five.

We
have estimated that we will incur minimum expenses equal to 25,000 in the first 12 months following our September 30, 2024 quarter-end
in order to maintain our business operations. However, if we complete a financing, we will devote the capital raised to operational expenses
as indicated below. The Company will attempt to complete a financing for a minimum of 400,000 within 6-12 months following the Company s
September 30, 2024 quarter-end. Any capital raised will be through either a private placement and will result in the issuance of common
shares from the Company s authorized capital.

following our September 30, 2024 quarter-end. 

Reports
to Security Holders 

The
Company intends to furnish its stockholders with annual reports containing consolidated financial statements audited by its independent
registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for
each of the first three quarters of each year. The Company files Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current
Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet its timely and continuous disclosure requirements. The
Company may also file additional documents with the Commission if those documents become necessary in the course of its operations. 

The
public may read and copy any materials that the Company files with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that
file electronically with the SEC. The site address is www.sec.gov. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and related management
discussion herein. 

Our
financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United
States GAAP ). 

Going
Concern Qualification 

Several
conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, the Company has recently commenced generating revenue and has an accumulated deficit 641,870 as of September 30,
2024 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. In addition, the
Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional
capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common
stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore,
our auditors opinion has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

10 

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and the implementation of its strategic plans provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

The
Company generated 2,574 in sales during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, and for the three month period ended September
30, 2023 the Company did not have any sales. For the six month period ended September 30, 2024 the Company generated 8,856 in sales,
and for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 the Company did not have any sales. The Company launched its new e-commerce platform,
laurenbentleyswim.com in October 2023. The Company has received its bulk production from its factory in Portugal in order to generate
revenues as the Company expands its operations. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 52,773, as compared to 59,570 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Operating
expenses for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 were 93,099, as compared to 90,777 for the six month period ended September
30, 2023. The operating expenses were primarily attributed to ongoing consulting expense, professional fees related to the Company s
yearly audit and quarterly reviews, and general expenses related to travel to visit the Company s factories in Portugal. 

Net
loss 

The
Company reported a net loss of 49,560 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and 61,341 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. The Company reported a net loss of 87,336 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 92,632 for the six months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The ongoing loss was primarily due to the consulting expenses, professional fees, and travel
expenses as indicated above. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 21,713 in consulting fees as compared to 8,536 for the three month
period ended September 30, 2023. In addition, professional fees for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 were 15,915 as compared
to the three month period ended September 30, 2023 6,732. The increase in professional fees and consulting fees relates to an increase
in the amount of time required for the auditor to value inventory as well as the Company s need to attract investment capital to
expand business operations. 

The
Company expects professional and legal fees to remain consistent going forward as the Company is a public reporting company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires that it maintain relationships with both PCAOB registered audit firms and securities
counsel to assist with the SEC reporting requirements. In addition, the Company may also attempt to purchase other companies or assets,
and operations of other entities if the advantageous situation presents itself. This could require the Company to incur substantial professional
fees. 

The
Company reported 9,485 in General and Administrative Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 22,158 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in General and Administrative Expenses is primarily attributed to lower travel expenses
related to visiting our manufacturer in Porto, Portugal. 

The
Company has also reported 5,435 in Advertising and Promotion Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 22,074
for the quarter September 30, 2023. The decrease in Advertising and Promotion Expenses is primarily attributed to the Company bearing
the expenses for the website development and campaign shoot in previous quarter periods. The Company expects the Advertising and Promotion
Expense to increase going forward as the Company expands its promotion of the Lauren Bentley Swimwear line. 

We
anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future. If we require additional capital, we
will have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. 

11 

Income
Tax 

During
the period from inception (April 3, 2019) to September 30, 2024, we had no provision for income taxes due to the net operating losses
incurred. 

Off
Balance Sheet Financing 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going
Concern 

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has recently started generating revenue and has an accumulated deficit
 641,870 as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception. This
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for
the Company to continue as a going concern.

Our
cash balance was 1,988 and 4,448 as of September 30, 2024, and as of March 31, 2024, respectively. We recorded a net loss of 49,560
for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, and 61,341 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We
believe we can satisfy our cash requirements for the next 6 months. We anticipate that our fixed costs made up of legal accounting
and general administrative expenses for the next 6 months will total approximately 25,000. Legal and accounting expenses of 20,000
represents the minimum funds needed to sustain operations. The 25,000 will be financed through the Company s cash balance of 1,988,
additional financing, net sales, and if needed, an advance from our directors, Lauren Bentley and Jordan Starkman. Currently there
is no firm loan commitment between the Company and Lauren Bentley and Jordan Starkman in place. We do not anticipate the purchase or
sale of any significant equipment. We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees, until financing is raised. The
foregoing represents our best estimate of our cash needs based on our current business condition. The exact allocation, purposes and
timing of any monies raised in subsequent private financings may vary significantly depending upon the exact amount of funds raised and
our progress with the execution of our business plan. It is currently expected that the Company will spend an additional 250,000 in
variable costs relating to marketing and business development that will be funded from future financings. 

We
expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operations, the production of our
swimwear, and marketing expenses for our business operations. We anticipate generating revenues from the brand launch in October 2023.
The success of our operations is dependent on attaining adequate revenue. We cannot assure investors that adequate revenues will be generated.
In the absence of our projected revenues, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations. Even without adequate revenues within
the next 6 months, we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities, but we may require financing to achieve our
profit, revenue, and growth goals. 

12 

In
the event we are not successful in reaching our initial revenue targets, additional funds may be required, and we may not be able to
proceed with our business plan for the development and marketing of our core services. Should this occur, we would likely seek additional
financing to support the continued operation of our business. We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations,
we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations
and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of
our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition. There
is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove
to be accurate. 

The
Company is currently seeking funding for our continued operations. The Company intends to raise a minimum of 400,000 and a maximum of
 1,000,000 in order to expand the introduction and launch of the www.laurenbentleyswim.com e-commerce site to the retail community
and fashion world. The Company launched the site in October 2023. To achieve our goals the Company expects to commit the majority of
its funding to production of the swimwear lines, and to the advertising of the Company s web site. There is no assurance that the
company will be able to raise the capital required to complete its goal and objectives and the Company is currently seeking capital to
further its business plan. Any capital raised will be through either a private placement or a convertible debenture and will result in
the issuance of common shares from the Company s authorized capital. There are no agreements with any parties at this point in
time for additional funding; however, we are in preliminary discussions with various funders in the US. 

We
presently do not have any significant credit available, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to our operating losses,
our operations have not been a source of liquidity. We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become
profitable. In order to obtain capital, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or borrow funds from private lenders.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities
may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities
may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on
our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate
providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing shareholders. Even if we are
able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts
owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. 

No
assurance can be given that sources of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient
to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the
future, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce
the scope of our planned marketing efforts and development of various swimwear styles, any of which could have a negative impact on our
business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which
could require us to: 1) Limit the production of a select swimwear designs, 2) Seek strategic partnerships that may force us to relinquish
control of the Company, or 3) Explore potential mergers or sales of significant assets of our Company. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards 

We
do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of operations,
financial position, or cash flows of the Company.

Seasonality 

The
swimwear industry in North America is seasonal however, we do not expect our sales to be dramatically impacted by seasonal demands for
our products and services since our market is worldwide. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Effects
of Inflation 

We
do believe that inflation will have an impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.

 Controls
 and Procedures 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean the company s controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to
ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required
to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information
required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
with the time periods specified. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement
of these objectives. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
