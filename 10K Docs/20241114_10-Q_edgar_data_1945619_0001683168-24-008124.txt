Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

Plan of Operation 

From January 1, 2023 to December 14, 2023, the
Company had no operations or revenues from a continuing business other than the general and administrative expenditures related to running
the Company. 

On December 14, 2023, our Board of Directors approved
the appointment of Edward Honour, Jeffrey Lozinski, Joseph Lehman, and Robert Jackson to the Board of Directors of the Company, and appointed
Edward Honour as Chairman (the New Directors ). Erik Nelson remained a director of the Company. At the same time, the Board
of Directors approved the issuance of 21,600,000 shares of common stock in the Company s offering at 0.001 per share, of which
19,950,000 were acquired by the New Directors and the remainder were acquired by new employees. In addition, the Board of Directors also
approved a private offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at 0.05 per share, and the spouse of a New Director purchased the initial
1,000,000 shares in such an offering. As a result of both transactions, the New Directors and their affiliates acquired an aggregate of
20,950,000 Shares of common stock in the Company, which is control of a majority of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company
at the time. 

On December 14, 2023, the Board of Directors approved
a resolution to enter the business of artificial intelligence hosting, research development, and consulting (collectively, AI ),
and since has entered into a number of contracts and raised a material amount of capital from the private placement of its common stock
to capitalize the business. As a result, the Company believes it no longer qualifies as a shell company. 

In December 2023, following the change to the
composition of our Board of Directors on December 14, 2023, we began implementing our business plan. We generated our first consulting
revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

We have identified five basic segments to our
AI business: technical consulting; GPU infrastructure and rental (Kinetic Cloud); open source software and libraries; software and platform
as a service (SaaS/PaaS); and education and training. We are focusing our initial efforts on our education and training segment, which
is targeted toward educating and training existing non-AI business in how they incorporate AI technology to optimize the performance of
their existing business. We believe that developing a respected education and training business will create a natural sales channel for
our other segments, such as consulting and GPU hosting and rental. Secondarily, we are marketing our consulting and implementation services
to the growing body of AI startups who may lack the inhouse expertise to implement their AI business. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the Company generated 64,966 and -0- in consulting revenue as a result of its recent entry into the AI business. During the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cost of consulting labor to generate this revenue was 52,490 and -0-, respectively.

30, 2023. The significantly higher level of operating expenses in three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to expenses incurred as part of the Company s entry into the AI business, whereas the Company
was an inactive shell company in the 2023 period, and 750,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation incurred in the 2024 period. The Company
expects that operating expenses comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, payroll and benefits and
rent, will be trend materially higher in future periods as the Company begins paying regular compensation to existing officers and directors,
hires additional employees, and incurs other costs associated with the commencement and expansion of operations. 

Other (Expense) 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
the Company incurred 10,125 in other expenses, as compared to 10,681 of other expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
In both periods, all of the other expenses consisted of interest expense on outstanding loans. 

Net (Loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 the Company incurred a net loss of (1,053,518), or (0.06) per share, compared to a net loss of (28,027),
or (0.01) per share during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the Company s net loss in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to the factors discussed above. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

Revenues 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
generated 137,291 and -0- in consulting revenue as a result of its recent entry into the AI business. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the cost of consulting labor to generate this revenue was 106,749 and -0-, respectively. 

Operating Expenses 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
the Company incurred 1,711,583 in operating expenses compared to 42,227 in operating expenses during the prior nine months ended September
30, 2023. The significantly higher level of operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to expenses incurred as part of the Company s entry into the AI business, whereas the Company
was an inactive shell company in the 2023 period, and 752,000 in stock-based compensation incurred in the 2024 period. The Company expects
that operating expenses comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, payroll and benefits and rent, will
be trend materially higher in future periods as the Company begins paying regular compensation to existing officers and directors, hires
additional employees, and incurs other costs associated with the commencement and expansion of operations. 

Other (Expense) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
the Company incurred 29,397 in other expenses, as compared to 23,767 of other expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
In both periods, all of the other expenses consisted of interest expense on outstanding loans. The higher level of interest expense in
the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period was because of a higher level of interest-bearing loans outstanding. 

14 

Net (Loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 the Company incurred a net loss of (1,710,438) or (0.07) per share, as compared to a net loss of (66,044),
or (0.01) per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the Company s net loss in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to the factors discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13,969 in cash on hand. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company had a net
loss of (1,730,667). 

Cash flows used in operating activities were (853,954)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used in operating activities (52,442) for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The material increase in cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months compared to the same nine month period
in 2023 is primarily attributable to a significant increase in operations due to the Company s entry into the AI business, whereas
in the 2023 period the Company was a non-operating shell company. 

Cash flows used in investing activities were (100,178)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of -0- for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. The entire increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the nine-month 2024 period, as compared to the same nine-month
period in 2023, is due to the purchase of equipment to be used in our new business. 

Cash flows provided by financing activities were
 950,169 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55,000 in cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
is primarily attributable to 786,050 received from the private placement of common stock compared to -0- in the same period in 2023,
and 200,000 received from the issuance of notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to -0- in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, offset by principal reductions of some notes. 

Management intends to fund our working capital
requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

Based upon our current operations, we do not have
sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. The Company needs substantial capital to carryout out its current
business, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital or that the terms of any capital raise are
not dilutive to current shareholders or carry other terms that are unfavorable to the Company and its shareholders. 

Additional issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges
senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We anticipate that we will incur operating losses
in the next 12 months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model,
recognition of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement,
and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified
personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

General 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We describe in this section certain critical accounting
policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it
requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and
if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur
periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect
its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements. For further information on the critical
accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Financial Statements. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ),
which is the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. The most
significant estimates relate to income taxes and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known or expected
trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information available as of the date of
these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary
cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
using the fair value method following the guidance outlined in Section 718-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosure about stock-based compensation.
This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during
which service is provided. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which service is not provided or rendered. 

16 

Related party transactions 

The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party
Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. In accordance with ASC 850, the Company s
financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances,
and other similar items in the ordinary course of business, as well as transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of financial
statements. 

Net Loss per Share 

Net loss per common share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. 
Basic earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. As of 

 September 30, 2024 there were no common stock
equivalents that were dilutive. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences
between depreciation which is deductible for tax purposes prior to being deductible for book purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities
are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes also are recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. 

From time to time, the Company may have differences
in computing the book and tax bases of property and equipment; reserves for bad debts; capitalized overhead included in inventories; bonus
plan payables, and accrued wages to shareholders/employees. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of the changes in the deferred
tax assets, net of the valuation reserve, and liabilities. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 FASB ASC 740 ), Income Taxes, which
clarifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertainty in tax positions. It requires a two-step approach to evaluate tax
positions and determine if they should be recognized in the financial statements. The two-step approach involves recognizing any tax positions
that are more likely than not to occur and then measuring those positions to determine if they are recognizable in the financial
statements. Management regularly reviews and analyzes all tax positions and has determined that no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition
have occurred. 

In general, the Company s income tax returns
are subject to examination by the taxing authorities for six years after they were filed. The Company has not filed any tax returns. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

All other newly issued accounting pronouncements, but not yet effective,
have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None.

Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information called for by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has concluded that its disclosure controls were effective
as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting . 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of condensed financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of condensed financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the condensed financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of condensed financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

The Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

We plan to rectify these weaknesses by establishing written policies
and procedures for our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

Since our prior fiscal year ended on December
31, 2023, we have concluded that some of our internal control deficiencies have been remediated. Specifically, we previously identified
insufficient segregation of duties within the accounting function, and over reliance on an outside financial consulting for financial
reporting as internal control weaknesses. With the recent addition of experienced officers and other employees, we no longer consider
these issues to be internal control weaknesses. 

18 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

The Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Legal expenses associated with any contingency are expensed as incurred.
The Company s officers and directors are not aware of any threatened or pending litigation to which the Company is a party or which
any of its property is the subject and which would have any material, adverse effect on the Company.
