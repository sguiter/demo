Future production and timing of production is based on internal reserves estimates and internal economic models for specific proved oil and gas assets. Price assumptions were based on a combination of market information and published industry resources adjusted for historical differentials. Price assumptions ranged from approximately per barrel of oil increasing to approximately per barrel of oil for the period, with an unweighted arithmetic average price of for WTI indexed assets for the same period. Natural gas prices ranged from approximately per MCF to per MCF for the period, with an unweighted arithmetic average price of for NYMEX based assets for the same period. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices were held flat after 2038 and were adjusted for location and quality differentials. Operating and capital cost estimates were based on current observable costs and were further escalated percent in every period. The weighted average cost of capital is calculated based on industry peers and best approximates the cost of capital an external market participant would expect to obtain.

 CREDIT RISK 
 The majority of Occidental s credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its counterparties and their potential inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk, if any.

 The worldwide effective tax rates for the periods presented in the table above were primarily driven by Occidental's jurisdictional mix of income. U.S. income is taxed at a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , while international income is subject to tax at statutory rates as high as 55 . 
 
 INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND PILLAR TWO 
 In August 2022, Congress passed the IRA that contains, among other provisions, a corporate book minimum tax on financial statement income, an excise tax on stock buybacks, a methane emissions charge and certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. Occidental is currently evaluating the guidance and proposed regulations. The ultimate impact of the IRA to Occidental will depend on a number of factors including future commodity prices, interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance. 
 Approximately 140 countries have agreed to a statement in support of the OECD Pillar Two initiative that proposes a 15 global minimum tax on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. A number of countries, including European Union member states, the United Kingdom, and Canada have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to be effective in 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. As the legislation becomes effective in countries in which Occidental operates, its cash tax could increase, and its effective tax rate could be negatively impacted. Occidental will continue to monitor proposed legislation and guidance issued by both the OECD as well as the jurisdictions in which it operates to assess the impact on its tax position. We do not expect the provisions effective in 2024 to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 As of September 30, 2024, environmental remediation liabilities of Occidental subsidiaries exceeded million each at of the sites described above, and of the sites had liabilities from to million each. Based on current estimates, Occidental expects its subsidiaries to expend funds corresponding to approximately of the period-end remediation balance over the next three to with the remainder over the subsequent or more years. 
 Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses of its subsidiaries beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for the environmental sites in the table above could be up to billion. The status of Occidental's involvement with the sites and related significant assumptions have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 
 MAXUS ENVIRONMENTAL SITES 
 A significant portion of aggregate estimates of environmental remediation liabilities and reasonably possible additional losses described above relates to the former DSCC. When OxyChem acquired DSCC in 1986, Maxus agreed to indemnify OxyChem for a number of environmental sites, including the DASS. In June 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In 2023, OxyChem recovered the majority of its remaining claims for indemnified costs from the proceeds of litigation brought by the Maxus Liquidating Trust. 
 
 DIAMOND ALKALI SUPERFUND SITE 
 The EPA has organized the DASS into Operable Units (OUs) for evaluating, selecting and implementing remediation under CERCLA. OxyChem s current activities in each OU are summarized below, many of which are performed on OxyChem s behalf by Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc. 
 OU1 The Former Diamond Alkali Plant at 80-120 Lister Avenue in Newark: Maxus and its affiliates implemented an interim remedy of OU1 pursuant to a 1990 Consent Decree, for which OxyChem currently performs maintenance and monitoring. In September 2024, the EPA proposed a final remedy for OU1 for public comment. 
 21 

Miles of the Lower Passaic River: In March 2016, the EPA issued a ROD specifying remedial actions required for OU2. During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus s bankruptcy filing, OxyChem and the EPA entered into an AOC to complete the design of the remedy selected in the ROD. In May 2024, the EPA approved OxyChem's remedial design for OU2. In June 2024, the EPA notified OxyChem that the work required by the AOC has been fully performed in accordance with its terms. In 2016, the EPA sent notice letters to approximately parties notifying them that they were potentially responsible to pay the costs to implement the remedy in OU2. In June 2018, OxyChem filed a complaint under CERCLA in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties seeking contribution and cost recovery of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the AOC and the OU2 ROD, or to perform other remediation activities related to the DASS (2018 Contribution Action). The District Court has not adjudicated OxyChem s relative share of responsibility for those costs. The EPA has estimated the cost to remediate OU2 to be approximately billion. 
 OU3 Newark Bay Study Area, including Newark Bay and Portions of the Hackensack River, Arthur Kill, and Kill van Kull: Maxus and its affiliates initiated a remedial investigation and feasibility study of OU3 pursuant to a 2004 AOC which was amended in 2010. OxyChem is currently performing feasibility study activities in OU3. In September 2022, the EPA listed the Lower Hackensack River (LHR) on the NPL, and this listed site comprises several existing NPL sites along a portion of that river that flows into OU3. In January 2024, the EPA sent a general notice letter requesting that OxyChem and four other entities coordinate certain investigation activities at the LHR site. 
 OU4 The -mile Lower Passaic River Study Area, comprising OU2 and the Upper Miles of the Lower Passaic River: In September 2021, the EPA issued a ROD selecting an interim remedy for the portion of OU4 that excludes OU2 and is located upstream from the Lister Avenue Plant site for which OxyChem inherited legal responsibility. The EPA has estimated the cost to remediate OU4 to be approximately million. At this time, OxyChem's role or responsibilities under the OU4 ROD, and those of other potentially responsible parties, have not been adjudicated. To provide continued, efficient remediation progress, in January 2022, OxyChem offered to design and implement the interim remedy for OU4 subject to certain conditions, including a condition that the EPA would not seek to bar OxyChem s right to seek contribution or cost recovery from any other parties that are potentially responsible to pay for the OU4 interim remedy. In March 2022, the EPA sent a notice letter to OxyChem and other parties requesting good faith offers to implement the selected remedies at OU2 and OU4. OxyChem submitted a good faith offer in June 2022, reaffirming the offer to design the remedy for OU4 and offering to enter into additional sequential agreements to remediate OU2 and OU4, subject to similar conditions, including that the EPA not seek to bar OxyChem from pursuing contribution or cost recovery from other responsible parties. The EPA did not accept OxyChem's June 2022 offer. In March 2023, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (OU4 UAO) in which it directed and ordered OxyChem to design the EPA s selected interim remedy for OU4 and to provide approximately million in financial assurance to secure its performance. Subject to all its defenses, OxyChem is designing the interim remedy in compliance with the OU4 UAO. Because OxyChem is incurring costs to implement the OU4 UAO, and the EPA is proposing to bar OxyChem's contribution claims against various parties as part of the Alden Leeds litigation described below, including those asserted in the 2018 Contribution Action, OxyChem filed a cost recovery action under CERCLA in March 2023 in the District Court against multiple parties (2023 Cost Recovery Action). 
 Natural Resource Trustees In addition to the activities of the EPA and OxyChem in the OUs described above, federal and state natural resource trustees are assessing natural resources in the Lower Passaic River and Greater Newark Bay to evaluate potential claims for natural resource damages. 
 
 ALDEN LEEDS LITIGATION 
 In December 2022, the EPA and the DOJ filed a proposed Consent Decree in the Alden Leeds litigation seeking court approval to settle with parties for a total of million with no requirement that the settling parties perform remediation work. OxyChem believes the proposed settlement is based on an unauthorized, flawed and disproportionate allocation of responsibility and would inappropriately release settling companies from liability to the United States for remediation costs in DASS OU2 and OU4. OxyChem also believes it would bar OxyChem from pursuing contribution against those parties for remediation costs OxyChem had incurred or may incur in the future to design and implement the remedies in OU2 and OU4, including claims OxyChem asserted in the 2018 Contribution Action. The proposed settlement does not address the liability of entities that were excluded from the settlement for the DASS, including OU2, OU3, OU4 or natural resource damages, or the liability of any settling party with respect to OU3 or natural resource damages. The proposed settlement was subject to a public comment period that closed in March 2023. In January 2024, the DOJ filed a proposed Amended Consent Decree in which it excluded companies from the proposed settlement, among other changes, followed by a motion to approve the Amended Consent Decree. 
 OxyChem believes the proposed settlement and Amended Consent Decree rely, improperly, on an allocation report prepared by an EPA contractor in which the contractor purported to assign a disproportionate share of the responsibility for remediation costs in OU2 and OU4 to OxyChem. OxyChem also believes that this process was unreasonably limited in scope and unreliably based on voluntary reporting by the settling parties, instead of sworn evidence, publicly available 
 22 

parties that the EPA proposes to release in this settlement. 
 OxyChem intends to challenge vigorously the proposed settlement and Amended Consent Decree, as well as the allocation report and process upon which they are based, and to seek contribution and cost recovery from other potentially responsible parties for remediation costs it has incurred or may incur at the DASS. OxyChem filed its response to the motion to approve the Amended Consent Decree in April 2024, to which other parties filed replies in May 2024. 
 OxyChem does not know when the District Court will rule on the DOJ s motion to approve the Amended Consent Decree. If the Amended Consent Decree is approved by the District Court and not overturned on appeal, then, notwithstanding OxyChem s vigorous, good faith effort to contest the settlement proposed in the Alden Leeds litigation, the EPA could attempt to compel OxyChem to bear substantially all the estimated cost to design and implement the OU2 and OU4 remedies. Such a result could have a material adverse impact on OxyChem and Occidental s consolidated results of operations in the period recorded. 
 While the remedies for OU2 and OU4 are expected to take over to complete, the EPA may seek to require OxyChem to provide additional financial assurance. In the OU4 UAO, the EPA directed OxyChem to post financial assurance of approximately million. Subject to all defenses, OxyChem has complied with this directive. The amount of any additional financial assurance is not subject to estimation at this time. It is uncertain when or to what extent the EPA may take action to compel OxyChem to perform further remediation in OU2 or OU4 or the amount of financial assurance the EPA may attempt to require OxyChem to post. For further information on the Alden Leeds litigation, see Note 9 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies . 
 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 For the DASS, OxyChem has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the maintenance and monitoring required in the OU1 Consent Decree, the design and implementation of remedies selected in the OU2 ROD and AOC and the OU4 ROD and OU4 UAO, and the remedial investigation and feasibility study required in OU3. 
 OxyChem s accrued environmental remediation reserve does not reflect the potential for additional remediation costs or natural resource damages for the DASS that OxyChem believes are not reasonably estimable. OxyChem s ultimate liability at the DASS may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and the reasonably possible additional losses, and is subject to final design plans, further action by the EPA and natural resource trustees, and the resolution of OxyChem's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties, among other factors. 
 OxyChem continues to evaluate the estimated costs currently recorded for remediation at the DASS as well as the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded. Given the complexity and extent of the remediation efforts, estimates of the remediation costs may increase or decrease over time as new information becomes available.

 ALDEN LEEDS AND OTHER LITIGATION 
 As described in Note 8 Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures , OxyChem intends to challenge vigorously the proposed settlement and Amended Consent Decree in the Alden Leeds litigation, as well as the allocation report and process upon which they are based. In the 2018 Contribution Action and 2023 Cost Recovery Action, OxyChem also intends to defend and prosecute vigorously its right to seek contribution and cost recovery from all potentially responsible parties to pay remediation costs in the DASS and to seek a judicial allocation of responsibility under CERCLA. The 2018 Contribution Action and the 2023 Cost Recovery Action are currently stayed pending the outcome of the Alden Leeds litigation. OxyChem is unable to estimate the timing of the District Court s decision, its outcome, or the outcome of any appeals from the District Court s decision. 
 
 TAX MATTERS AND DISPUTES 
 During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and international tax jurisdictions. Tax years through 2021 for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the IRS pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Tax years through 2018 have been audited for state income tax purposes. There are no outstanding significant audit matters in international jurisdictions. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. 
 For Anadarko, its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for U.S. federal tax purposes have been audited and closed by the IRS. Tax years 2015 and 2017 through 2019 have been audited by the IRS but remain open pending the outcome of the Tronox U.S. Tax Court litigation discussed below. Tax years through 2010 have been audited for state income tax purposes. There is one outstanding significant tax matter in an international jurisdiction related to a discontinued operation. As stated above, during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. 
 Other than the dispute discussed below, Occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax disputes would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 Anadarko received an million tentative refund in 2016 related to its billion Tronox Adversary Proceeding settlement payment in 2015. In September 2018, Anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting Anadarko s refund claim. As a result, Anadarko filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowances in November 2018. Trial was held in May 2023.The parties filed post-trial briefs throughout 2023 and 2024. Closing arguments were held in May 2024. An opinion by the Tax Court could be issued at any time. If any tax liability is due as a result of the Tax Court s opinion, it must be fully bonded or paid in full within 90 days of the entry of decision by the Tax Court. If an appeal is not pursued by Anadarko, any resulting tax deficiency will be assessed by the IRS and would be due within 30 days of receiving a formal notice of tax assessment. 
 In accordance with ASC 740 s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of million. Additionally, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on approximately million of additional cash tax benefits realized from the utilization of tax attributes generated as a result of the deduction of the billion Tronox Adversary Proceeding settlement payment in 2015. As a result, should Occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue, there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest. However, in that event, as of September 30, 2024, Occidental would be required to repay approximately billion in federal taxes, million in state taxes and accrued interest of million. A liability for the taxes and interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other. 
 
 INDEMNITIES TO THIRD PARTIES 
 Occidental, its subsidiaries, or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental or its subsidiaries. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of September 30, 2024, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Portions of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to: any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items or future financial position or sources of financing; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations or business strategy; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Words such as estimate, project, predict, will, would, should, could, may, might, anticipate, plan, intend, believe, expect, aim, goal, target, objective, "commit," "advance," likely or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report unless an earlier date is specified. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Actual outcomes or results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially. Forward-looking and other statements regarding Occidental's sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or require disclosure in Occidental's filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and definitions, assumptions, data sources and estimates or measurements that are subject to change in the future, including future rulemaking. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including slowdowns and recessions, domestically or internationally; Occidental s indebtedness and other payment obligations, including the need to generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations; Occidental s ability to successfully monetize select assets and repay or refinance debt and the impact of changes in Occidental s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates; assumptions about energy markets; global and local commodity and commodity-futures pricing fluctuations and volatility; supply and demand considerations for, and the prices of, Occidental s products and services; actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries; results from operations and competitive conditions; future impairments of Occidental's proved and unproved oil and gas properties or equity investments, or write-downs of productive assets, causing charges to earnings; unexpected changes in costs; inflation, its impact on markets and economic activity and related monetary policy actions by governments in response to inflation; availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations; the regulatory approval environment, including Occidental's ability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other government approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; Occidental's ability to successfully complete, or any material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency projects, acquisitions or divestitures; risks associated with acquisitions (including our recently completed acquisition of CrownRock, L.P.), mergers and joint ventures, such as difficulties integrating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected synergies, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; Occidental s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve Occidental s competitiveness; exploration, drilling and other operational risks; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver Occidental s oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; volatility in the securities, capital or credit markets, including capital market disruptions and instability of financial institutions; government actions, war (including the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East) and political conditions and events; health, safety and environmental (HSE) risks, costs and liability under existing or future federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international HSE laws, regulations and litigation (including related to climate change or remedial actions or assessments); legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, retroactive royalty or production tax regimes and deep-water and onshore drilling and permitting regulations; Occidental's ability to recognize intended benefits from its business strategies and initiatives, such as Occidental's low-carbon ventures businesses or announced greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or net-zero goals; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation, government investigations and other proceedings; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or insurgent activity; the scope and duration of global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, and actions taken by government authorities and other third parties in connection therewith; the creditworthiness and performance of Occidental's counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners and other parties; failure of risk management; Occidental s ability to retain and hire key personnel; supply, transportation and labor constraints; reorganization or restructuring of Occidental s operations; changes in state, federal or international tax rates; and actions by third parties that are beyond Occidental's control. 
 Additional information concerning these and other factors that may cause Occidental s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations can be found in Occidental s other filings with the SEC, including Occidental s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
 28 

CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK 
 
 Occidental s operations, financial condition, cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices, the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads, chemical product prices and inflationary pressures in the macro-economic environment. The average WTI price per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 75.09, compared to 80.56 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 82.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in prices could result in adjustments in capital investment levels and allocation, which impact production volumes. It is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, evolving macro-economic environment that impacts energy demand, future actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflicts in the Middle East, and the U.S. Government's management of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in Occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings. 
 Occidental works to manage inflation impacts by capitalizing on operational efficiencies, proactive contract management and working closely with vendors to secure the supply of critical materials. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of Occidental's outstanding debt was fixed rate. 
 
 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 
 Occidental s capital and operational priorities are intended to maximize cash flow through focused investments in short and medium-cycle projects to enhance current year and future cash flows. Occidental's strategic priorities include: 
 
 Maintain production base to preserve asset base integrity and longevity; 
 Deliver a sustainable and growing dividend; 
 Enhance its asset base with new investments in its cash-generative energy and chemical businesses as well as emerging low-carbon businesses; 
 Advance technologies and business solutions to help drive a sustainable low-carbon future; and 
 Prioritize the proceeds from asset divestitures and excess cash flow for deleveraging until principal debt is below 15 billion. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Occidental generated cash flow from continuing operations of 8.2 billion and incurred capital expenditures of 5.2 billion. 
 
 DEBT 
 As of September 30, 2024, Occidental s long-term debt was rated Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, BBB- by Fitch Ratings and BB+ by Standard and Poor s. Any downgrade in credit ratings could impact Occidental's ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital. In addition, Occidental or its subsidiaries may be requested, elect to provide or in some cases be required to provide collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or other acceptable support as financial assurance of their performance and payment obligations under certain contractual arrangements, such as pipeline transportation contracts, oil and gas purchase contracts and certain derivative instruments; certain permits, including with respect to carbon capture, utilization and storage activities; and environmental remediation matters. 
 In connection with the CrownRock Acquisition, Occidental issued 9.7 billion in new debt in July 2024 and assumed 1.2 billion of existing CrownRock debt in August 2024. Occidental's credit ratings were reaffirmed by credit agencies post bond offering launch. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, Occidental repaid 4.0 billion of debt. As of September 30, 2024, Occidental had approximately 1.0 billion of debt maturities due in the next 12 months, excluding the current portion of finance leases. For information on Occidental's debt activity, see Note 4 - Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

29 

SHAREHOLDER RETURNS 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Occidental declared dividends to common shareholders of 606 million or 0.66 per share. 
 
 CROWNROCK ACQUISITION 
 In December 2023, Occidental entered into an agreement to purchase CrownRock, L.P. for total consideration of 12.4 billion, consisting of 9.4 billion of cash consideration (inclusive of certain working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments), 29.6 million shares of common stock of Occidental, and the assumption of 1.2 billion of existing debt of CrownRock. The acquisition closed August 1, 2024, adding to Occidental's oil and gas portfolio in the Permian Basin. See Note 5 - Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 DIVESTITURE PROGRAM 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Occidental sold non-core assets in the Powder River Basin with near to intermediate term lease expirations and certain Delaware Basin assets in Texas and New Mexico for combined net proceeds of 779 million. Occidental recognized a pre-tax loss of 479 million on the asset sales. In addition, Occidental sold 19.5 million of its limited partner units in WES for proceeds of 697 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of 489 million.

 32 

Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 
 Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased, driven by lower crude oil commodity prices in the oil and gas segment, higher interest expense due to increase in long-term debt for the acquisition of CrownRock, and lower earnings in the midstream and marketing results due to lower equity method investment income from WES, partially offset by increased crude oil and NGL sales volumes, primarily from the CrownRock Acquisition, and other production increases in the Permian Basin. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, decreased, driven by lower realized pricing across most product lines, primarily caustic soda in the chemical segment and lower domestic gas prices in the oil and gas segment, partially offset by increased sales volumes in the oil and gas segment and higher gas marketing margins due to transportation capacity optimization in the midstream and marketing segment. 
 
 SELECTED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ITEMS 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended millions September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net sales 7,173 6,817 19,965 21,085 Interest, dividends and other income 60 34 130 107 Gains (losses) on sales of assets and other, net (79) 28 (52) 197 Oil and gas operating expense 1,207 1,179 3,547 3,400 Transportation and gathering expense 407 405 1,165 1,122 Chemical and midstream cost of sales 806 821 2,369 2,218 Purchased commodities 83 89 258 1,508 Selling, general and administrative expenses 268 259 786 776 Other operating and non-operating expense 334 344 1,088 646 Taxes other than on income 256 265 756 862 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,926 1,775 5,394 5,142 Asset impairments and other charges 21 21 209 Acquisition-related costs 49 14 75 Exploration expense 57 83 206 329 Interest and debt expense, net 312 252 848 698 Income from equity investments and other 166 242 709 391 Income tax expense (454) (465) (1,223) (1,372) Discontinued operations, net of taxes 182 
 
 Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 
 Net sales increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to higher domestic crude oil and NGL volumes in the oil and gas segment, primarily from the CrownRock Acquisition, and other production increases in the Permian Basin. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Net sales decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower realized prices across most products in the chemical segment and lower domestic natural gas prices in the oil and gas segment, partially offset by higher oil prices in the oil and gas segment. 
 33 

Gains (losses) on sales of assets and other, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the sale of non-core assets in the Powder River Basin with near to intermediate term lease expirations and certain Delaware Basin assets in Texas and New Mexico for combined net proceeds of 779 million. Occidental recognized a pre-tax loss of 479 million on the asset sales. In addition, Occidental sold 19.5 million of its limited partner units in WES for proceeds of 697 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of 489 million. 
 Purchased commodities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to lower volumes on third-party crude purchases as certain crude supply contracts expired in 2023 in the midstream and marketing segment. 
 Other operating and non-operating expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to the 260 million remeasurement of the valuation allowance for the Maxus Liquidating Trust recorded in 2023 and higher legal settlement costs and increases in compensation costs in 2024. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to increased sales volumes in the Permian Basin and Rockies. 
 Income from equity investments and other increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to gains on sales of assets and higher operating income recognized by WES. 
 I ncome from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a legal settlement related to the Andes Arbitration. For further information on the Andes Arbitration, see Note 9 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies . 

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Occidental s principal businesses consist of three reporting segments: oil and gas, chemical and midstream and marketing. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas. The chemical segment is operated by our subsidiary Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), which mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment purchases, markets, gathers, processes, transports and stores oil (which includes condensate), NGL, natural gas, CO 2 and power. It also optimizes its transportation and storage capacity and invests in entities that conduct similar activities such as WES. 
 The midstream and marketing segment also includes Occidental's low-carbon ventures businesses. Occidental's low-carbon ventures businesses seek to leverage Occidental s legacy of carbon management experience to develop carbon capture, utilization and storage projects, including the commercialization of direct air capture technology, invest in other low-carbon technologies intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Occidental's operations and strategically partner with other industries to help reduce their emissions.

 Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 
 Oil and gas segment earnings decreased to 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with segment earnings of 1.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, oil and gas segment earnings increased due to higher domestic crude oil and NGL sales volumes primarily related to the CrownRock Acquisition and other production increases in the Permian Basin, partially offset by lower domestic crude oil prices. 
 The increase in average daily sales volumes of 151 Mboe/d for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to the CrownRock Acquisition and other production increases in the Permian Basin. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Oil and gas segment earnings were 4.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, oil and gas segment earnings slightly decreased primarily due to lower domestic gas prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 
 Average daily sales volumes increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily related to increased U.S. onshore production, including volumes from the CrownRock 
 35 

Acquisition, and higher Al Hosn Gas production, as the Al Hosn Gas expansion project was completed in the three months ended June 30, 2023. 
 The following table presents an analysis of the impacts of changes in average realized prices and sales volumes with regard to Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas revenue:

 (b) Excludes "other" oil and gas revenue. See Note 2 - Revenue in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding other revenue. 

CHEMICAL SEGMENT 
 Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 
 Chemical segment earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 304 million, compared to 296 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, remained essentially flat as market conditions remained relatively unchanged. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Chemical segment earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 854 million, compared to 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment earnings was due to lower realized pricing across most product lines, primarily caustic soda, partially offset by improved demand across most product lines and favorable energy and ethylene costs. 
 36 

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENT 
 Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 
 Midstream and marketing segment earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 631 million, compared to segment earnings of 116 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, midstream and marketing third quarter results decreased due to lower equity method investment income from WES and decreased ownership after the sale of limited partner units in August 2024. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Midstream and marketing segment earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 714 million, compared to segment losses of 158 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, midstream and marketing results increased due to higher gas marketing margin from transportation capacity optimization and higher equity method investment income from WES. 

INCOME TAXES 
 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income: 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended millions, except percentages September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Income before income taxes 1,594 1,635 4,239 4,870 Income tax expense Domestic - federal and state (254) (274) (700) (825) International (200) (191) (523) (547) Total income tax expense (454) (465) (1,223) (1,372) Income from continuing operations 1,140 1,170 3,016 3,498 Worldwide effective tax rate 28 28 29 28 
 
 Occidental estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its quarterly provision for income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which Occidental operates, adjusted for certain discrete items. Each quarter, Occidental updates these rates and records a cumulative adjustment to its income taxes by applying the rates to the pre-tax income excluding certain discrete items. Occidental s quarterly estimate of its effective tax rates can vary significantly based on various forecasted items, including future commodity prices, capital expenditures, expenses for which tax benefits are not recognized and the geographic mix of pre-tax income and losses. 
 The worldwide effective tax rates for the periods presented in the table above are primarily driven by Occidental's jurisdictional mix of income. U.S. income is taxed at a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , while international income is subject to tax at statutory rates as high as 55 . 
 
 INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND PILLAR TWO 
 For more information on the potential impacts to Occidental related to the IRA and Pillar Two initiative, see Note 7 - Income Taxes . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 SOURCES AND USES OF CASH 
 As of September 30, 2024, Occidental's sources of liquidity included 1.8 billion o f cash and cash equivalents, 4.15 billion of borrowing capacity under its RCF, and 600 million of available borrowing capacity on its receivables securitization facility. In February 2024, Occidental entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for the RCF extending the maturity date to June 30, 2028, and in May 2024, Occidental amended the RCF to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional 150 million to 4.15 billion. In July 2024, Occidental amended and extended the maturity date of its existing receivables securitization facility to July 30, 2027, maintaining 600 million of available borrowing capacity. There were no borrowings outstanding on Occidental's RCF or receivables securitization facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 37 

Operating Cash Flows 
 Operating cash flow from continuing operations was 8.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating cash flow from continuing operations compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to working capital cash uses related to timing of crude sales and changes in crude oil prices in the midstream and marketing segment and lower realized pricing across most product lines in the chemical segment, primarily caustic soda. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Occidental s net cash used by investing activities was 12.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing activities include the purchase price of the CrownRock Acquisition consisting of 8.8 billion of net cash consideration (inclusive of cash acquired, certain working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments). See Note 5 - Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on 1.6 billion of divestitures. 
 Capital expenditures, of which the majority were for the oil and gas segment, were approximately 5.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in capital spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented the continued construction of STRATOS, Occidental s first large-scale DAC facility in Ector County, Texas, increased activities in the domestic oil and gas segment, and the continued expansion and conversion activities of OxyChem s Battleground chlor-alkali plant to membrane technology. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Occidental s net cash provided by financing activities was 5.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included net proceeds from debt issuance of 9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 571 million primarily related to warrant exercises, and payments of cash dividends of 1.1 billion. Occidental repaid 4.0 billion of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 4 - Long-Term Debt in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a rollforward of debt activity. 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 4.4 billion, which included treasury share repurchases of 1.6 billion, preferred stock redemptions of 1.7 billion and cash dividends paid of 1.0 billion. 
 Occidental s Zero Coupons can be put to Occidental in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons can next be put to Occidental in October 2025, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately 381 million at such date. None of the outstanding Zero Coupons were put to Occidental in October 2024. Occidental currently has the ability to meet this obligation and may use available capacity under the RCF and other committed facilities to satisfy the put should it be exercised. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this filing, Occidental was in compliance with all covenants in its financing agreements. As of September 30, 2024, Occidental has debt maturities of 1.5 billion in 2025, 4.1 billion in 2026, 1.5 billion in 2027 and 17.8 billion thereafter. Occidental currently expects its cash on hand, operating cash flows and funds available from the RCF and other committed facilities to be sufficient to meet its near-term debt maturities, operating expenditures, capital expenditures and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. 
 Occidental or its subsidiaries have provided financial assurances through a combination of cash, letters of credit and surety bonds. As of September 30, 2024, Occidental had not issued any letters of credit under the RCF or other committed facilities. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of Occidental s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
 As of September 30, 2024, Occidental has approximately 1.2 billion remaining under its share repurchase program, which was authorized in 2023. 

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES 
 
 Occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Occidental s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations as an integral part of its business planning process. 
 The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at Third-Party, Currently Operated, and Closed or Non-Operated Sites, which categories may include NPL Sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or 
 38 

monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, natural resource damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. 
 See Note 8 - Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and the Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Occidental s environmental liabilities and expenditures. 

LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters and its estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses for such matters. See Note 8 - Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures and Note 9 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
