 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For
the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

million. The Company will continue to incur significant expenses for development activities for their lead product NELL-1/DBM.
Operating expenditures for the next twelve months are estimated at million. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of million, and used net cash in operating activities of
 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent
registered public accounting firm, in its audit report to the financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash on hand. Available cash is anticipated to cover our operational needs into
the second quarter of 2025. 

The
Company will continue to attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund future operations and to provide additional
working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to
meet the Company s needs. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s on-going cash requirements, the Company
will be required to scale back or discontinue its product development programs, or obtain funds if available (although there can be no
certainties) through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish rights to its technology, or substantially reduce
or discontinue its operations entirely. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that
it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain
undue restrictions on the Company s operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders,
in the case of equity financing. 

Reverse
stock splits 

On
June 5, 2023, The amendment
was authorized by the Company s stockholders on May 1, 2023, and was effective on June 5, 2023. 

On
December 14, 2023, The amendment
was authorized by the Company s stockholders on December 12, 2023, and was effective on December 20, 2023. 

All
share and per share amounts have been retro-actively restated as if the reverse splits occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
presented.

The Company has not experienced any losses to date resulting from this policy. 

Total liabilities at fair value 

Change in fair value

on their short-term nature and are excluded from the fair value tables above.

warrants. The warrants provide for
a Black Scholes value calculation, as defined, in the event of certain transactions Fundamental Transactions, as defined),
which includes a floor on volatility utilized in the Black Scholes value calculation at 100 or greater. The Company has determined that
this provision introduces leverage to the holders of the warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement
amount of a fixed-for-fixed option on the Company s own equity shares. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 815, the Company has classified
the fair value of the warrants as a liability to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported
in the statement of operations.

Fair Value of warrant liability 

The
risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company determines expected volatility based
upon the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The Company does not believe that the future volatility of its common
stock over an option s expected term is likely to differ significantly from the past. The expected term of the warrants granted
are determined based on the duration of time the warrants are expected to be outstanding. The dividend yield on the Company s warrants
is assumed to be zero as the Company has not historically paid dividends.

Due
to certain beneficial ownership limitations set forth in the March 2024 warrants, the Company issued the number of shares that would
not cause a holder to exceed such beneficial ownership limitation and agreed to hold such balance of shares of common stock in abeyance.
For the March 2024 warrants that were exercised, an aggregate of shares of common stock were held in abeyance until notice
was received that the shares of common stock could be issued in compliance with such beneficial ownership limitations. As of September
23, 2024, all abeyance shares were released and issued.

Vesting of options differs based on the terms of each option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had
stock-based compensation expense of and , respectively, related to the vesting of stock options granted to the Company s
employees and directors included in our reported net loss. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, options exercisable
into shares of common stock were issued to employees in settlement of previously accrued bonuses of . 

In
January 2024, options exercisable into shares of common stock were forfeited upon the resignation of a director. The Company s
policy is to account for forfeitures of the unvested portion of option grants when they occur; therefore, these forfeitures are recorded
as a reversal to expense, which can result in a credit balance in the statement of operations. 

Expected Volatility 

Expected life (in years) 

Expected dividend yield 

The
expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of
options granted. The Company determines the expected volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock since listing
on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company does not believe that the future volatility of its common stock over an option s expected
term is likely to differ significantly from the past. The risk-free interest rate used in the calculations is based on the implied yield
available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options as calculated using the simplified
method. The expected life of the options used was based on the contractual life of the option granted. Stock-based compensation is a
non-cash expense because the Company settles these obligations by issuing shares of its common stock from its authorized shares instead
of settling such obligations with cash payments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was . The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of years.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and audited consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, with the SEC on February 21, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See Note on Forward-Looking Statements for a
discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results and the timing of events could
differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. 

Company
Overview 

We
are a medical device company that is currently focused on bone regeneration in spinal fusion using the recombinant human protein known
as NELL-1. NELL-1 in combination with DBM, demineralized bone matrix, is an osteopromotive recombinant protein that provides target specific
control over bone regeneration. The NELL-1 technology platform has been licensed exclusively for worldwide applications to us through
a technology transfer from the UCLA Technology Development Group on behalf of UC Regents UCLA TDG ). UCLA TDG and the Company
received guidance from the Food and Drug Administration FDA that NELL-1/DBM will be classified as a device/drug combination
product that will require an FDA-approved pre-market approval application before it can be commercialized in the United States. 

We
were founded by University of California professors in collaboration with an Osaka University professor and a University of Southern
California surgeon in 2004 as a privately-held company with proprietary, patented technology that has been validated in sheep and non-human
primate models to facilitate bone growth. We believe our platform technology has application in delivering improved outcomes in the surgical
specialties of spinal, orthopedic, general orthopedic, plastic reconstruction, neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and sports medicine.
Lead product development and clinical studies are targeted on spinal fusion surgery, one of the larger segments in the orthopedic market. 

We
are a development stage entity. The production and marketing of our products and ongoing research and development activities are subject
to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing in the United States, any combination
product developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) testing and an extensive regulatory approval
process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter problems
in clinical trials that will cause us or the FDA to delay or suspend the clinical trials. 

Our
success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without
infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents
issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable, or circumvented, or that the rights granted
thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us. 

On
June 20, 2024, we announced that the first patient had been treated in the multicenter, prospective, randomized pilot clinical study
of the Company s NB1 bone graft device. NB1 is NELL-1 protein combined with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) to provide rapid, specific
and guided control over bone regeneration. 

This
pilot clinical study will evaluate NB1 in 30 adult subjects who undergo transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) to treat degenerative
disc disease (DDD) and will evaluate safety and effectiveness, fusion success, pain, function improvement and adverse events. To be enrolled
in the study, patients must have DDD at one level from L2-S1 and may also have up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis or Grade 1 retrolisthesis
at the involved level. Patient treatment is conducted in Australia. The study design was previously reviewed and agreed
upon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s Division of Orthopedic Devices in a Pre-submission to support progression to a
pivotal clinical trial in the United States. 

UCLA
TDG Exclusive License Agreement 

Effective
April 9, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement dated as of March 21, 2019, which was subsequently
amended through three sets of amendments (as so amended the Amended License Agreement with the UCLA TDG. The Amended License
Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement, dated as of June 19, 2017 (the 2017 Agreement ).
The 2017 Agreement amended and restated the Exclusive License Agreement, effective March 15, 2006, between the Company and UCLA TDG,
as amended by ten amendments. Under the terms of the Amended License Agreement, the Regents have continued to grant us exclusive rights
to develop and commercialize NELL-1 (the Licensed Product for spinal fusion by local administration, osteoporosis and
trauma applications. The Licensed Product is a recombinant human protein growth factor that is essential for normal bone development.

We
have agreed to pay an annual maintenance fee to UCLA TDG of 10,000 as well as pay certain royalties to UCLA TDG under the Amended License
Agreement at the rate of 3.0 of net sales of licensed products or licensed methods. We must pay the royalties to UCLA TDG on a quarterly
basis. Upon a first commercial sale, we also must pay a minimum annual royalty between 50,000 and 250,000, depending on the calendar
year which is after the first commercial sale. If we are required to pay any third party any royalties as a result of us making use of
UCLA TDG patents, then we may reduce the royalty owed to UCLA TDG by 0.333 for every percentage point paid to a third party. If we grant
sublicense rights to a third party to use the UCLA TDG patent, then we will pay UCLA TDG 10 to 20 of the sublicensing income we receive
from such sublicense. 

We
are obligated to make the following milestone payments to UCLA TDG for each Licensed Product or Licensed Method: 

100,000 upon enrollment of the first subject in a
 Feasibility Study; 

250,000 upon enrollment of the first subject in a
 Pivotal Study: 

500,000 upon Pre-Market Approval of a Licensed Product
 or Licensed Method; and 

1,000,000 upon the First Commercial Sale of a Licensed
 Product or Licensed Method. 

We
are also obligated pay to UCLA TDG a fee (the Diligence Fee of 8,000,000 upon the sale of any Licensed Product (the Triggering
Sale Date in accordance with the payment schedule below: 

Due upon cumulative Net Sales equaling 50,000,000
 following the Triggering Sale Date - 2,000,000; 

Due upon cumulative Net Sales equaling 100,000,000
 following the Triggering Sale Date - 2,000,000; and 

Due upon cumulative Net Sales equaling 200,000,000
 following the Triggering Sale Date - 4,000,000. 

Our
obligation to pay the Diligence Fee will survive termination or expiration of the Amended License Agreement and we are prohibited from
assigning, selling, or otherwise transferring any of its assets related to any Licensed Product unless our Diligence Fee obligation is
assigned, sold, or transferred along with such assets, or unless we pay UCLA TDG the Diligence Fee within ten (10) days of such assignment,
sale or other transfer of such rights to any Licensed Product. 

We
are also obligated to pay UCLA TDG a cash milestone payment within thirty (30) days of a Liquidity Event (including a Change of Control
Transaction and a payment election by UCLA TDG exercisable after December 22, 2016) such payment to equal the greater of: 

500,000; or 

2 of all proceeds in connection with a Change of Control
 Transaction. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the first patients were treated in the multicenter, prospective, randomized pilot clinical
study of the Company s NB1 bone graft device, triggering the payment of the initial 100,000 Feasibility Study milestone. 

We
are obligated to diligently proceed with developing and commercializing licensed products under UCLA TDG patents set forth in the Amended
License Agreement. We are required to meet certain diligence milestone deadlines pursuant to the Amended License Agreement. Applicable
for the current year, we are required to spend at least 1,000,000 per calendar year on pre-clinical or clinical development until the
date that we complete a Phase III pivotal study. If we fail to meet this or the other diligence milestone deadlines, UCLA TDG has the
right to either terminate the license or reduce the license to a non-exclusive license.

We
must reimburse or pre-pay UCLA TDG for patent prosecution and maintenance costs incurred during the term of the Amended License Agreement.
We have the right to bring infringement actions against third party infringers of the Amended License Agreement, UCLA TDG may join voluntarily,
at its own expense, or, at our expense, be joined involuntarily to the action. We are required to indemnify UCLA TDG against any third
party claims arising out of our exercise of the rights under the Amended License Agreement or any sublicense. 

Payments
to UCLA TDG under the Amended License Agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 123,058 and 23,238, respectively. 

Appointment
of Director 

On October 16, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors appointed Phillip Meikle to the Board of Directors. Don Hankey resigned from
the Board of Directors on October 1, 2024, effective immediately. Mr. Meikle received an initial option grant to purchase 9 shares of
common stock under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan at an exercise price of 1.88 per share. The initial director option
grant vests and becomes exercisable on the date of the next annual meeting of the stockholders following the grant date. Mr. Meikle also
received an annual director option grant to purchase 28,185 shares of common stock under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan at an exercise
price of 1.88 per share. The annual director option grant vests and becomes exercisable in four equal installments on December 17, 2024,
March 19, 2025, June 19, 2025 and September 17, 2025. 

ATM
Offering 

On
September 27, 2024, we entered into the ATM Agreement pursuant to which we could sell, at our option, up to an aggregate of 1,143,121
in shares of our common stock through Wainwright through the ATM Facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold 366,794 shares of
common stock through the ATM Facility for net proceeds of 640,613, after accounting for 131,396 in offering costs. 

August
2024 Warrant Inducement 

On August 2, 2024, existing warrants to purchase 781,251
shares of common stock issued in March 2024, were exercised for cash at the exercise price of 2.43 per share, for gross proceeds of 1,898,440.
As an inducement for the warrant holders to exercise the existing warrants for cash, Inducement Warrants were issued to the warrant holders
for consideration of 0.125 per share, for gross proceeds of 195,313. The proceeds received from the exercise of the 781,251 existing
warrants, and the issuance of the Inducement Warrants, net of cash costs of 287,233, was 1,806,520. 

The Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of
 2.00 per share and were immediately exercisable upon issuance. 781,251 of the Inducement Warrants expire on February 2, 2026, and 781,251

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development expenditures saw a notable decline, dropping from 1,574,850 for the three months ending September 30, 2023,
to 429,747 for the same period in 2024, marking a decrease of 1,145,103. The decrease in costs can be attributed to the significant
expenses incurred in 2023 for the production of the NELL-1 protein necessary for our initial clinical study. Moving forward, we anticipate
continued substantial investment in development activities for NELL-1 as we prepare for our pivotal clinical study in the future. 

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative costs increased from 506,040 for the three months ending September 30, 2023, to 521,274 for the corresponding
period in 2024, reflecting a 15,234 minimal increase. 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability 

In
October 2022, we completed a public equity offering, which included the issuance of 54,174 warrants. The warrants provide for a Black
Scholes value calculation in the event of certain transactions Fundamental Transactions, as defined), which includes a
floor on volatility utilized in the value calculation at 100 or greater. We have determined that this provision introduces leverage
to the holders of the warrants that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed option
on the Company s own equity shares. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 815, we have classified the fair value of the warrants as a liability
to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations. 

The
change in fair value of warrant liability represents the re-measurement of the outstanding warrant liabilities at September 30, 2024.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Going
Concern and Liquidity 

Since
inception to September 30, 2024, we have incurred accumulated losses of approximately 83.5 million. We will continue to incur significant
expenses for development activities for our lead product NELL-1/DBM. Operating expenditures for the next twelve months are estimated
at 5.4 million. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of 2.6 million, and used
net cash in operating activities of 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year
from the issuance date of these financial statements. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its audit report
to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

March
2024 Offering 

On
March 6, 2024, the Company sold 119,000 shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase 119,000 shares of common stock (exercise

was 1,504,113. 

The
781,251 warrants have an exercise price of 2.43 per share, and are exercisable immediately for a term of five years. The 662,251 pre-funded
warrants have an exercise price of 0.001 per share and are exercisable immediately for a term of five years. 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, 363,251 pre-funded warrants were exercised and 363,251 shares of common stock were issued. During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the balance of 299,000 pre-funded warrants were exercised and 299,000 shares of common stock were
issued. 

In addition, warrants to purchase 46,875 shares of common stock were issued
to Wainwright, in connection with the March 2024 offering. The warrants issued to Wainwright have an exercise price of 3.20 per share
and expire in five years. 

August
2024 Warrant Inducement 

On
August 2, 2024, existing warrants to purchase 781,251 shares of common stock issued in March 2024, were exercised for cash at the exercise
price of 2.43 per share, for gross proceeds of 1,898,440. As an inducement for the warrant holders to exercise the existing warrants
for cash, Inducement Warrants were issued to the warrant
holders for consideration of 0.125 per share, for gross proceeds of 195,313. The proceeds received from the exercise of the 781,251
existing warrants, and the issuance of the Inducement Warrants, net of cash costs of 287,233, was 1,806,520. 

The
Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of 2.00 per share and were immediately exercisable upon issuance. 781,251 of the Inducement
Warrants expire on February 2, 2026, and 781,251 of the Inducement Warrants expire on August 2, 2029. 

In addition, warrants to purchase 46,875 shares of common stock were issued
to Wainwright, in connection with the August 2024 warrant inducement. The warrants issued to Wainwright have an exercise price of 3.35
per share and expire in five years. 

September
2024 ATM Offering 

On
September 27, 2024, the Company entered into the ATM Agreement with Wainwright with respect to the ATM Facility, under which the Company
may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, issue and sell through Wainwright, acting as agent or principal, up to approximately
 1.1 million of shares of its common stock. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold 366,794
shares of common stock through the ATM Facility for net proceeds of 640,613, after accounting for 131,396 in offering costs. 

We
will continue to attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund future operations and to provide additional working
capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our
needs. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our on-going cash requirements, we will be required to scale back or discontinue
our product development programs, or obtain funds if available (although there can be no certainties) through strategic alliances that
may require us to relinquish rights to our technology or substantially reduce or discontinue our operations entirely. No assurance can
be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if
we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 3,566,426 and 3,026,569, respectively. Available cash is anticipated to cover
our operational needs into the second quarter of 2025. 

We
anticipate that we will require approximately 5 million to complete first-in-man studies, and an estimated additional 24 million in
scientific expenses to achieve FDA approval, if possible, for a spine interbody fusion indication.
