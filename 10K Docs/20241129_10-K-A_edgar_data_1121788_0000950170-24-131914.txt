PART III 
 Item 13.	Certain Relationships and Relate d Transactions, and Director Independence 
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
 Garmin has adopted a written policy for the review by the Audit Committee of transactions in which Garmin is a participant and any related person will have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. This policy is generally designed to cover those related party transactions that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement, annual report on Form 10-K or registration statement pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. However, the policy is more encompassing in that the amount involved in a transaction covered by the policy must only exceed 60,000 while disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K is required only if the amount involved exceeds 120,000. The policy defines the terms transaction and related person in the same manner as Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 If the nature of the timing of a related party transaction is such that it is not practical to obtain advance approval by the Audit Committee, then management may enter into it, subject to ratification by the Audit Committee. If ratification is not subsequently obtained, then management must take all reasonable efforts to cause the related person transaction to be null and void. 
 The Audit Committee will approve or ratify only those related party transactions that it determines in good faith are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of Garmin and its shareholders. In making that determination, the Audit Committee shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to it, including the benefits to Garmin and whether the related party transaction is on terms and conditions comparable to those available in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party that can provide comparable products or services. 
 The Audit Committee will also annually review ongoing related party transactions after considering all relevant facts and circumstances. The Audit Committee will then determine if those transactions should be terminated or modified based on whether it is still in the best interests, or not inconsistent with the best interests, of Garmin and its shareholders. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Philip I. Straub, Executive Vice President, Managing Director-Aviation, Garmin International, Inc., has served as an executive officer of the Company since 2011. Mr. Straub has two family members who have been non-executive employees of Garmin International, Inc. since prior to 2011. One family member has received annual compensation from 2011 through 2023 ranging from over 120,000 to less than 300,000. The other family member has received annual compensation from 2014 (the first year in which such family member s annual compensation exceeded 120,000) through 2023 ranging from over 120,000 to less than 300,000. 
 Susan Lyman, Vice President, Global Consumer Marketing, Garmin International, Inc., has served as an executive officer of the Company since February of 2024. Ms. Lyman has a family member who has been a non-executive employee of Garmin International, Inc. since prior to 2024 and who received annual compensation in 2023 of more than 120,000 but less than 300,000. 
 The compensation of Mr. Straub s and Ms. Lyman s family members described above was established by Garmin International, Inc. in accordance with its standard compensation practices and is consistent with other employees in similar positions with comparable qualifications, tenure and responsibilities. In addition to the annual compensation provided above, the family members of Mr. Straub and Ms. Lyman also received customary employee benefits available to all salaried employees in the United States. 
 In October 2024, the Company determined that such transactions had not previously been approved or ratified by the Company s Audit Committee. Subsequently, the Audit Committee reviewed and ratified the related party transactions described above with respect to Mr. Straub and Ms. Lyman, including the annual compensation paid to their family members, which were not previously reported. Concurrently, the Audit Committee also approved and ratified three other similar related party transactions for which the amount of annual compensation involved exceeded the 60,000 threshold set forth in the Company s Policy and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions but was less than 120,000.
