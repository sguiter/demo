 Seller Note 
 
 On November 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of CD for a total purchase price of 246.8 million. This acquisition was funded by borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and an interest-free note from the seller with aggregate principal payments of million (the "Seller Note"). The Seller Note is due and payable in cash with million maturing on November 1, 2024 and million maturing on November 1, 2025. On the acquisition date, the Company recorded the Seller Note at its present value of million by discounting the future principal payments using an imputed rate of interest of approximately in accordance with accounting guidance in ASC 835, Interest. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made an indemnity claim against the Seller Note of 0.2 million. The Company recognized imputed interest expense on the Seller Note of approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The Seller Note is secured by certain assets (including equity interest) acquired in connection with the acquisition. The Seller Note includes Knowles Capital Holdings, Inc. and Knowles Intermediate PD Holdings, LLC as borrowers, which jointly and severally agree to pay James P. Kaplan, as representative of the sellers of Cornell Dubilier, the principal amount of million as described above. The Seller Note is not interest-bearing except at such time as an event of default has occurred, upon which and during the continuance of an event of default, all overdue principal will accrue interest at 2.0 per annum plus the SOFR-based rate otherwise applicable under the Company s existing credit facility. The Seller Note is subject to customary conditions and events of default and the secured nature of the Seller Note is supported by a Security Agreement.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 We are a market leader and global provider of high performance electronics for demanding applications, including ceramic capacitors and radio frequency ("RF") filters, advanced medtech microphones, balanced armature speakers, advanced micro-acoustic microphones, and audio solutions, serving the medtech, defense, electric vehicle, industrial, communications, and consumer electronics markets. Our focus on the customer, combined with unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, and global operational expertise, enables us to deliver innovative solutions across multiple applications. References to "Knowles," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" refer to Knowles Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
 We sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and through distributors worldwide. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 On September 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell and assign certain assets and liabilities of the Company s Consumer MEMS Microphones CMM business to Syntiant Corp. ("Syntiant") for approximately million in total consideration, consisting of 70.0 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and inventory adjustments, and 80.0 million in Syntiant Series D-2 preferred stock, to be issued upon the closing of this transaction. The Company will also share in certain separation costs pursuant to a credit for up to 13.5 million, which Syntiant may apply to specified separation costs post-closing. In addition, the Company has committed to provide, under certain circumstances, up to 15.0 million in financing in connection with Syntiant's obligation to have 40.0 million of cash on the balance sheet, which financing would be junior to Syntiant's debt financing. The consummation of the transaction is not subject to a financing condition, but is subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 3. Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements." 
 
 The CMM divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, we have reclassified the results of operations and financial position of CMM to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within this Quarterly Report to the consolidated financial statements relates to our continuing operations. 
 
 This divestiture supports Knowles' continued transformation into an industrial technology company, consisting of its Precision Devices ("PD") and MedTech Specialty Audio ("MSA") segments, primarily serving the defense, medtech, industrial, and electrification markets. We may incur some amount of dis-synergies following the sale of the CMM business due to the reduced size of our company and, as a result, we may undertake actions to help ensure that our cost structure is appropriate to support our remaining businesses. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to the GAAP financial measures included in this item, we have presented certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP measures as supplements to our GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of our business, and our executive management team and Board of Directors focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of our performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist us in comparing our performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation included herein.

 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 142.5 million, compared with 108.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 34.4 million or 31.8 . PD revenues increased 28.6 million due to our acquisition of the CD business. However, our legacy PD business experienced lower demand from the industrial and communication markets as a result of continued demand weakness associated with excess customer and channel inventory, partially offset by higher demand from the defense and medtech markets. MSA revenues increased 5.8 million, primarily due to higher shipping volumes of hearing health products driven by stronger end market demand and higher shipping volumes into the specialty audio market, partially offset by lower average pricing on mature products. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold ("COGS") for the third quarter of 2024 was 79.5 million, compared with 57.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 22.0 million or 38.3 . This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of CD and lower factory capacity utilization in our legacy PD business, partially offset by product cost reductions and factory productivity improvements in the legacy PD business. 
 
 Restructuring Charges 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of 0.1 million within Gross profit for costs associated with transferring certain capacitors manufacturing to existing facilities to further optimize operations, and 0.1 million within Operating expenses related to headcount reductions within the PD segment. For additional information, refer to Note 8. Restructuring and Related Activities to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded restructuring charges of 1.3 million for severance pay and benefits related to headcount reductions within our PD segment and 0.4 million in other charges, primarily in Operating expenses. For additional information, refer to Note 8. Restructuring and Related Activities to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 62.9 million, compared with 50.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 12.5 million or 24.8 . Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of 2024 was 44.1 , compared with 46.6 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to our acquisition of CD . The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the impacts of the acquisition of CD. Excluding the impacts of CD, gross profit margins increased primarily due to product cost reductions and factory productivity improvements in our legacy PD business, partially offset by lower factory capacity utilization in our legacy PD business and lower average pricing on mature products in our MSA business. 
 
 Non-GAAP gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 64.8 million, compared with 50.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 13.9 million or 27.3 . Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of 2024 was 45.5 , compared with 47.1 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in non-GAAP gross profit was primarily due to our acquisition of CD. The decrease in non-GAAP gross profit margin was primarily due to the impacts of the acquisition of CD. Excluding the impacts of CD, non-GAAP gross profit margins increased primarily due to product cost reductions and factory productivity improvements in our legacy PD business, partially offset by lower factory capacity utilization in our legacy PD business and lower average pricing on mature products in our MSA business. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 10.2 million, compared with 8.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 2.1 million or 25.9 . Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 7.2 and 7.5 , respectively. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by our acquisition of the CD business that increased expenses in our PD segment. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenues was driven by our acquisition of the CD business. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 33.9 million, compared with 29.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 4.5 million or 15.3 . Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 23.8 and 27.2 , respectively. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by our acquisition of CD, partially offset by lower professional fees and the benefits of PD restructuring actions taken in the prior year. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenues was driven by higher revenues. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.9 million, compared with 0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 3.3 million. The increase is primarily due to imputed interest expense on our Seller Note from the CD acquisition and a higher outstanding revolving credit facility balance during the third quarter of 2024. For additional information on borrowings and interest expense, refer to Note 9. Borrowings to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Other Expense (Income), net 
 
 Other expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.6 million, compared with income of 0.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, a change of 3.1 million.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes and Non-GAAP Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate ("ETR") from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 24.6 and (34.5) , respectively. The ETR from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 includes discrete items totaling 0.7 million of tax benefit primarily attributable to stock-based compensation and the deferred tax impact of a tax rate change. The ETR from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2023 includes discrete items totaling 0.3 million of tax benefit primarily attributable to stock-based compensation and the recognition of foreign tax credits resulting from the release of IRS Notice 2023-55. Absent the discrete items, the ETR from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 30.3 and (31.9) , respectively. The Company accrues taxes in various countries where it generates income and applies a valuation allowance in other jurisdictions, which resulted in the provision and benefit for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the ETR was mainly due to the impact of intangible property transfers in 2023, the mix of earnings and losses by taxing jurisdictions, and net discrete items. 
 
 The non-GAAP ETR from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 7.3 and 21.7 , respectively. The non-GAAP ETR from continuing operations includes discrete items totaling 0.9 million of tax benefit and no discrete impact for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Absent the discrete items, the non-GAAP ETR from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 10.7 and 21.7 , respectively. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credits compared to the prior year. 
 
 Earnings from Continuing Operations 
 
 Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 9.2 million, compared with 15.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 6.0 million. As described above, the decrease is primarily due to income tax expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit for the third quarter of 2023, along with higher operating expenses, interest expense, and unfavorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher gross profit. 
 
 Earnings and Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Interest and Income Taxes 
 
 Earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes ("EBIT") for the third quarter of 2024 was 16.1 million, compared with 11.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 4.2 million. EBIT margin (EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of 2024 was 11.3 , compared with 11.0 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency changes. The increase in EBIT margin was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses, the impacts of the acquisition of CD on gross margins, and unfavorable foreign currency changes. 
 
 Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 30.0 million, compared with 24.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.4 million. Adjusted EBIT margin (Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of 2024 was 21.1 , compared with 22.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBIT was primarily due to higher non-GAAP gross profit, partially offset by higher non-GAAP operating expenses, and unfavorable foreign currency changes. The decrease in Adjusted EBIT margin was primarily due to higher non-GAAP operating expenses, the impacts of the acquisition of CD on gross margins, and unfavorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher gross profit.

(Loss) Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net 
 
 Loss from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.7 million, compared with earnings of 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.1 million. The change in discontinued operations was primarily driven by our goodwill impairment and loss on disposal of business related to the pending divestiture of CMM, partially offset by favorable income tax changes. For additional information, refer to Note 3. Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations 
 
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.10 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 0.17 for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.07. As described above, the decrease is primarily due to income tax expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit for the third quarter of 2023, along with higher operating expenses, interest expense, and unfavorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher gross profit. 
 
 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.26 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 0.20 for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.06. As described above, the increase was due to higher non-GAAP gross profit and lower non-GAAP income tax expense, partially offset by higher non-GAAP operating expenses, interest expense, and unfavorable foreign currency changes.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 411.0 million, compared with 317.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 93.4 million or 29.4 . PD revenues increased 75.5 million due to our acquisition of the CD business, partially offset by lower demand from the industrial and communication markets in our legacy PD business as a result of continued demand weakness associated with excess customer and channel inventory. MSA revenues increased 17.9 million, primarily due to higher shipping volumes of hearing health products driven by stronger end market demand, partially offset by lower shipping volumes into the specialty audio market and lower average pricing on mature products. In addition, revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were unfavorably impacted by financial incentives offered to customers in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in higher shipping volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 and lower revenues in the first quarter of 2023.

(1) In addition to the GAAP financial measures included herein, Knowles has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Knowles believes that non-GAAP measures are useful as supplements to its GAAP results of operations to evaluate certain aspects of its operations and financial performance, and its management team primarily focuses on non-GAAP items in evaluating Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. Knowles also believes that these measures assist it with comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. We believe that our future cash flow from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, strategic investments, and share repurchases. We have secured a revolving line of credit in the United States from a syndicate of commercial banks to provide additional liquidity. Furthermore, if we were to require additional cash above and beyond our cash on the balance sheet, the free cash flow generated by the business, and availability under our revolving credit facility, we would most likely seek to raise long-term financing through the U.S. debt or bank markets. 
 
 Due to the global nature of our operations, a portion of our cash is generated and typically held outside the United States. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 92.6 million and 87.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of these amounts, cash held by our non-U.S. operations totaled 32.7 million and 71.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. To the extent we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we may be required to pay U.S. state income taxes and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. Management will continue to reassess our need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to reduce our cash balance in the second half of the year, primarily driven by the payment of the Seller Note related to the CD acquisition and debt reduction, partially offset by cash generated from operations. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our CMM business for 150.0 million. For additional information, refer to Note 3. Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On June 17, 2024 in anticipation of the CMM transaction, we entered into a Consent Memorandum with the administrative agent and our lenders under the A R Credit Agreement (as defined below) regarding consents to certain conditions applicable to disposition of assets. For additional information refer to Note 9. Borrowings. 
 
 On November 1, 2023, we acquired (i) all the issued and outstanding shares of Kaplan Electronics, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc. and CD Aero, LLC (collectively, "Cornell Dubilier" or "CD") for aggregate consideration of 259.8 million, which equated to a total fair value of consideration transferred of 246.8 million. This acquisition's operations are included in the PD segment. For additional information, refer to Note 4. Acquisition to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 On September 25, 2023, the Company amended its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "A R Credit Agreement") to, among other things, (a) permit the Company in connection with the acquisition of Cornell Dubilier, to incur senior priority seller financing indebtedness (the Seller Note in an aggregate principal amount of 122.9 million secured by certain assets (including equity interests) acquired in connection with such acquisition and the capital stock of Cornell Dubilier, LLC (the Acquisition Assets ), which shall mature two years after the effective date of such Seller Note (the Seller Note Maturity Date ), (b) extends the requirement to pledge the Acquisition Assets that would otherwise constitute collateral under the Credit Agreement to the date that is 90 days after the Seller Note Maturity Date, and (c) restricts, until the Seller Note Maturity Date, the amount of dispositions and investments from the Company and certain of its subsidiaries into Cornell Dubilier, LLC and the acquired subsidiaries that constitute Acquisition Assets from exceeding 80.0 million the aggregate. All other terms remain the same as the A R Credit Agreement dated February 8, 2023. 
 
 On February 8, 2023, we entered into the A R Credit Agreement that amends and restates the prior Credit Agreement (the "2020 Credit Agreement"), which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with borrowings in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed 400.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were 108.0 million. At any time during the term of the Credit Facility, we will be permitted to request an increase to the commitments under the Credit Facility to establish one or more incremental term loans or revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 200.0 million for all such incremental facilities. Commitments under the Credit Facility will terminate, and loans outstanding thereunder will mature, on February 8, 2028. For additional information, refer to Note 9. Borrowings to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

On February 24, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to 100.0 million of our common stock. On April 28, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors had increased the authorization by up to 150.0 million in additional aggregate value. At September 30, 2024, we have 68.2 million remaining that may yet be repurchased under our share repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors, and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number, and share price of shares repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. Any shares repurchased will be held as treasury stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 1,686,253 and 1,630,161 shares of common stock, respectively, for a total of 29.5 million and of 27.5 million, respectively. 
 
 Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are presented on a consolidated basis, including discontinued operations. Cash flows are summarized in the following table: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 95.0 62.3 Investing activities (3.1) 0.3 Financing activities (87.2) (35.3) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.6 (0.4) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 5.3 26.9 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities adjusts net earnings for certain non-cash items, including impairment charges, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, changes in deferred income taxes, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Excluding non-cash items, the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 is primarily due to an increase in net earnings driven by higher revenues and gross profit. The increase was partially offset by higher restructuring and incentive compensation payments in 2024. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 The cash used in investing activities during 2024 was primarily driven by capital expenditures, which were lower in 2024 as compared to 2023, offset by proceeds from the sale of intellectual property. The cash provided by investing activities during 2023 was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of certain machinery and equipment, partially offset by capital expenditures to support product innovation and cost savings. 
 
 In 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range o f 2.0 to 3.0 of revenue s.

Table of Contents 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities during 2024 was primarily related to the 29.5 million of repurchases of common stock, the 52.0 million net payments on the revolving credit facility, the 6.4 million payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, and partially offset by proceeds of 2.1 million from the exercise of options. Cash used in financing activities during 2023 was primarily related to the 27.5 million of repurchases of common stock, the 6.2 million payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, and the 1.9 million payment of debt issuance costs, partially offset by proceeds of 1.6 million from the exercise of options. 
 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 
 In addition to measuring cash flow generation based on the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (including discontinued operations), Knowles also measures adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenues. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as non-GAAP net cash attributable to continuing operations less non-GAAP capital expenditures attributable to continuing operations. Non-GAAP net cash attributable to continuing operations is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less amounts attributable to discontinued operations. Non-GAAP capital expenditures attributable to continuing operations is defined as capital expenditures less amounts attributable to discontinued operations. Knowles believes these measures are helpful in measuring its cash generated from its continuing operations that is available to repay debt, fund acquisitions, and repurchase Knowles common stock. Adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenues are not presented in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. As such, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenues should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, any other liquidity measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The following table reconciles our adjusted free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 95.0 62.3 Less: amounts attributable to discontinued operations (22.1) (21.6) Non-GAAP net cash attributable to continuing operations 72.9 40.7 Capital expenditures (10.3) (11.8) Less: amounts attributable to discontinued operations 0.9 3.8 Non-GAAP capital expenditures attributable to continuing operations (9.4) (8.0) Non-GAAP net cash attributable to continuing operations 72.9 40.7 Non-GAAP capital expenditures attributable to continuing operations (9.4) (8.0) Adjusted free cash flow 63.5 32.7 Adjusted free cash flow as a of revenues 15.5 10.3 
 
 Contingent Obligations 
 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 This discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Estimates are revised periodically. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk as of December 31, 2023, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer ("CEO") and chief financial officer ("CFO"), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of an acquired business and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as we incorporate our controls and procedures into the recently acquired business. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by intentionally falsified documentation, by collusion of two or more individuals within Knowles or third parties, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as set forth below. 
 
 If we are unsuccessful in implementing our divestment strategy for the CMM business our business and financial results may be adversely affected. 
 
 The planned strategic divestiture of our CMM business involves significant risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The occurrence of an event, change, or other circumstance, such as various closing conditions associated with the transaction not being satisfied or waived, could give rise to the transaction terminating or a delay in consummation. Similarly, failure to obtain, delays in obtaining, or adverse conditions contained in, regulatory or other required approvals, could impact the timing and certainty of consummation. Further, we may encounter unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, such as legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company and others. The divestiture of CMM may also result in disruptions to our ongoing business due to, for example, challenges associated with the separation of business infrastructure, difficulties in employee retention, and the response of customers, distributors, suppliers and competitors. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 On February 24, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to 100.0 million of the Company's common stock. On April 28, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had increased the authorization by up to 150.0 million in additional aggregate value. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors, and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number, and share price of shares repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. Any shares repurchased will be held as treasury stock. 
 
 Below is a summary of share repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 (in millions, except share and per share amounts) Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under The Program September 2024 253,264 17.77 253,264 68.2
