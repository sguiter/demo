Changes in Debt Structure 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company repaid in full at maturity a mortgage note payable bearing interest at a rate of 4.77 per annum with an outstanding principal balance of 11.3 million. The mortgage note encumbered a 63,012 square foot property in California.

 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repaid in full at maturity, a mortgage note payable bearing interest at a rate of 4.15 per annum with an outstanding principal balance of 6.9 million. The mortgage note encumbered a 64,143 square foot property in Minnesota. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 The OP has issued unsecured notes described in Note 4 to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. All unsecured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, and the OP is 98.5 owned by the Company. Effective January 4, 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements which permit subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent to omit separate financial statements if the consolidated financial statements of the parent company have been filed, the subsidiary obligor is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company, the guaranteed security is debt or debt-like, and the security is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by the parent. 
 Accordingly, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, the Company has excluded the summarized financial information for the OP because the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the OP are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in the Company's consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 372.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 363.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Items impacting cash flows from operations include, but are not limited to, cash generated from property operations, interest payments and the timing of the payment of invoices and other expenses. 
 The Company may, from time to time, sell properties and redeploy cash from property sales into new investments or to repay indebtedness. The income from the new investments or reduction in interest expense could be less than the income from properties sold which would adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results 
 Management monitors factors and trends important to the Company and the REIT industry to gauge the potential impact on Company operations. In addition to the matters discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, some of the factors and trends that management believes may impact future operations of the Company are outlined below. 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 Rising interest rates and increased volatility in the capital markets have increased the Company s cost and availability of debt and equity capital. Limited availability and increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact the Company s ability to finance operations and acquire and develop properties. To the extent the Company s tenants experience increased costs or financing difficulties due to the economic and market conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting the Company s ability to sell existing assets or obtain joint venture capital.

Expiring Leases 
 The Company expects that approximately 15 o f its leases will expire each year in the ordinary course of business. There are 418 multi-tenant and single-tenant leases totaling 1.4 million square feet that will expire during the remainder of 2024. Approximately 69.7 of the leases expiring during the remainder of 2024 are for space in buildings located on or adjacent to hospital campuses, are distributed throughout the portfolio, and are not concentrated with any one tenant, health system or market area. The Company typically expects to retain 75 to 90 of tenants upon expiration, and the retention ratio for the first nine months of the year was within this range. 
 Steward Health 
 As previously disclosed, on May 6, 2024, Steward Health announced that it had filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Steward leased approximately 593,000 square feet of space from the Company. Leases for six buildings in Massachusetts totaling approximately 244,000 square feet were assumed in connection with the sale of Steward s Massachusetts hospitals on or about September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company received 2.2 million for prior rent owed under these assumed leases. 
 On October 25, 2024, leases for approximately 232,000 square feet in buildings in Florida and Massachusetts were rejected by Steward effective as of October 31, 2024, bringing the total leases rejected to 266,000 square feet. The total base rent associated with the leases rejected is approximately 0.6 million per month and the Company expects to cover operating expenses of an additional 0.2 million per month. The Company is in active discussions with Steward's subtenants to lease a portion of the rejected space. 
 The remaining Steward leases for approximately 83,000 square feet have not been rejected and are subject to continuing discussions. While the Company remains actively engaged in these discussions, significant uncertainty remains around whether these leases will be assumed or rejected. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The Company historically has experienced increases in property taxes throughout its portfolio as a result of increasing assessments and tax rates levied across the country. The Company continues its efforts to appeal property tax increases and manage the impact of the increases. In addition, the Company historically has incurred variability in portfolio utilities expense based on seasonality, with the first and third quarters usually reflecting greater amounts. The effects of these operating expense increases are mitigated in leases that have provisions for operating expense reimbursement. As of September 30, 2024, leases for approximately 92 of the Company's total leased square footage allow for some recovery of operating expenses, with approximately 29 having modified gross lease structures and approximately 63 having net lease structures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators 
 Management considers certain non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures management considers relevant to the Company's business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's historical consolidated operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income and cash flows from operations as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Funds from Operations ("FFO"), Normalized FFO and Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") 
 FFO and FFO per share are operating performance measures adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT s operating performance equal to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, impairment, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 In addition to FFO, the Company presents Normalized FFO and FAD. Normalized FFO is presented by adding to FFO acquisition-related costs, acceleration of debt issuance costs, debt extinguishment costs and other Company-defined normalizing items to evaluate operating performance. FAD is presented by adding to Normalized FFO non-

real estate depreciation and amortization, non-cash financing receivable amortization, loan origination cost amortization, deferred financing fees amortization, stock-based compensation expense and rent reserves, net; and subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, including second generation tenant improvements and leasing commissions paid and straight-line rent income, net of expense. The Company's definition of these terms may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing these amounts. FFO, Normalized FFO and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of the Company's liquidity. FFO, Normalized FFO and FAD should be reviewed in connection with GAAP financial measures. 
 Management believes FFO, Normalized FFO, FFO per common share, Normalized FFO per share and FAD ("Non-GAAP Measures") provide an understanding of the operating performance of the Company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization expense. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. The Company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, Non-GAAP Measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods. The Company reports Non-GAAP Measures because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs. For these reasons, management deems it appropriate to disclose and discuss these Non-GAAP Measures. However, none of these measures represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Further, these measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

Cash Net Operating Income ("NOI") and Same Store Cash NOI 
 Cash NOI and Same Store Cash NOI are key performance indicators. Management considers these to be supplemental measures that allow investors, analysts and Company management to measure unlevered property-level operating results. The Company defines Cash NOI as rental income, interest from financing receivables less property operating expenses. Cash NOI excludes non-cash items such as above and below market lease intangibles, straight-line rent, lease inducements, financing receivable amortization, tenant improvement amortization and leasing commission amortization. The Company also excludes cash lease termination fees. Cash NOI is historical and not necessarily indicative of future results. 
 Same Store Cash NOI compares Cash NOI for stabilized properties. Stabilized properties are properties that have been included in operations for the duration of the year-over-year comparison period presented. Accordingly, stabilized properties exclude properties that were recently acquired or disposed of, properties classified as held for sale or intended for sale, properties undergoing redevelopment, and newly-redeveloped or developed properties. 
 The Company utilizes the redevelopment classification for properties where management has approved a change in strategic direction for such properties through the application of additional resources including an amount of capital expenditures significantly above routine maintenance and capital improvement expenditures. 
 Any recently acquired property will be included in the same store pool once the Company has owned the property for five full quarters. Newly-developed or redeveloped properties will be included in the same store pool five full quarters after substantial completion. 
 The following table reflects the Company's Same Store Cash NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report and the risk factor discussed below, an investor should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results. The risks, as described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
 Risk Factors Relating to the Company 
 
 Operational Risks 
 The Company's results of operations have been and will continue to be impacted by the Steward Health bankruptcy. 
 As previously disclosed, on May 6, 2024, Steward Health announced that it had filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Steward leased approximately 593,000 square feet of space from the Company, accounting for approximately 2.0 of the Company s rental revenue. Leases for six buildings in Massachusetts totaling approximately 244,000 square feet were assumed in connection with the sale of Steward s Massachusetts hospitals on or about September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company received 2.2 million for prior rent owed under these assumed leases. 
 On October 25, 2024, leases for approximately 232,000 square feet in buildings in Florida and Massachusetts were rejected by Steward effective as of October 31, 2024, bringing the total leases rejected to 266,000 square feet. The total base rent associated with the leases rejected is approximately 0.6 million per month and the Company expects to cover operating expenses of an additional 0.2 million per month. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to re-let this leased space. 
 The remaining Steward leases for approximately 83,000 square feet are subject to continuing discussions with Steward and its hospital purchaser. While the Company remains actively engaged in these discussions, significant uncertainty remains around whether these leases will be assumed or rejected. 
 The Company will pursue claims for outstanding rent of 2.8 million against Steward in the bankruptcy court. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will recover unpaid rent from Steward.

It is intended that each installment of the payments of the severance compensation described in this Section 4, together with all other payments and benefits provided to Officer by Corporation, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, is a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(i) and satisfies, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A provided under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9). However, to the extent it is determined that such payments constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A and Officer is a specified employee, as such term is defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then, solely to the extent necessary to avoid the incurrence of the adverse personal tax consequences under Section 409A, the timing of such payments shall be delayed as follows on the earlier of six months and one day after Officer s separation from service (as defined below) or the date of Officer s death, the Corporation shall (A) pay to Officer a lump sum amount equal to the sum of the payments that Officer would otherwise have received through the delayed payment date, and (B) commence any remaining payments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that any such deferred compensation benefit is payable upon an event involving the Officer s cessation of services, such payment(s) shall not be made unless such event constitutes a separation from service pursuant to the default definition in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h). 
 
 4.5 Golden Parachute Restrictions. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by or on behalf of the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Officer as a result of and contingent on a change in

Reg. 1.280G-1 Q A-22) whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, (together, the Contingent Payment would constitute a parachute payment, as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1 Q A-30, the amount of the Contingent Payment to Officer shall be (A) reduced to an amount that is one dollar less than 300 of the Officer s base amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code), so that the amount of such payments do not constitute a parachute payment (the Safe Harbor Payment ), or, if greater, (B) the entire Contingent Payment, unreduced by the calculation in clause (A), provided that the net value of such Contingent Payment to the Officer exceeds the Safe Harbor Payment, after taking into account the additional taxes to Officer that apply to the unreduced Contingent Payment, including the excise taxes imposed thereon under section 4999 of the Code. The determination of the amount to be paid to Officer on account of this Section 4.5 shall be made by the accountant, tax counsel or other similar expert advisor to Officer (the Tax Advisor ), which shall, if requested, provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Executive and if requested, a written opinion. The supporting calculations shall include a valuation of the non-competition provisions of Section 5. The costs and expenses of the Tax Advisor shall be the responsibility of the Corporation.

The payments set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement are subject to the execution and delivery by Officer of a waiver and general release of claims (the Release to Corporation substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (and having not revoked such Release for a period of seven (7) days following its execution by Officer and its delivery to the Corporation). 
 
 5. Non-Competition Disclosure of Investments Consulting .

 (a) Officer shall not, without the prior written consent of Corporation, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be connected with as an officer, employee, partner, consultant or otherwise, or otherwise engage or participate in any corporation or other business entity engaged in the business of buying, selling, developing, building and or managing real estate facilities for the medical, healthcare and retirement sectors of the real estate industry. Officer understands and acknowledges that Corporation carries on business nationwide and that the nature of Corporation s activities cannot be confined to a limited area. Accordingly, Officer agrees that the geographic scope of this Section 5 shall include the United States of America. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ownership by Officer of less than 2 of any class of the outstanding capital stock of any corporation conducting such a competitive business which is regularly traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market shall not be a violation of the foregoing covenant. 
 
 (b) Simultaneously with Officer s execution of this Agreement and upon each anniversary of the Effective Date, Officer shall notify the Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the nature and extent of Officer s investments, stock holdings, employment as an employee, director, or any similar interest in any business or enterprise engaged in buying, selling, developing, building, and or managing real estate facilities for the medical, healthcare, and retirement sectors of the real estate industry other than Corporation engaged in the business of

Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9).

Reg. 1.280G-1 Q A-22) whether paid or payable or 

Exhibit 10.4 

distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, (together, the Contingent Payment would constitute a parachute payment, as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1 Q A-30, the amount of the Contingent Payment to Officer shall be (A) reduced to an amount that is one dollar less than 300 of the Officer s base amount (as defined in section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code), so that the amount of such payments do not constitute a parachute payment (the Safe Harbor Payment ), or, if greater, (B) the entire Contingent Payment, unreduced by the calculation in clause (A), provided that the net value of such Contingent Payment to the Officer exceeds the Safe Harbor Payment, after taking into account the additional taxes to Officer that apply to the unreduced Contingent Payment, including the excise taxes imposed thereon under section 4999 of the Code.
