 The Limited Partnership s principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships ), each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Limited Partnership invests will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code )(the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), and provide tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30 of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Limited Partnership has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD.
