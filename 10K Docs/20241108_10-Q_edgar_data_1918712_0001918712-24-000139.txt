 As of September 30, 2024

 for example, with the word million or otherwise) 
 (unaudited) 

million and million. As used herein, EBITDA represents annual net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. The Fund expects that a majority of its investments will be in directly originated loans. For cash management and other purposes, the Fund also intends to invest in broadly syndicated loans and other more liquid credit investments, including in publicly traded debt instruments and other instruments that are not directly originated. The Fund primarily invests in illiquid and restricted investments, and while most of the Fund s investments are expected to be in private U.S. companies (the Fund generally has to invest at least 70 of its total assets in qualifying assets, including private U.S. companies), the Fund may also invest from time to time in non-U.S. companies. The Fund s portfolio may also include equity securities such as common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options, which may be obtained as part of providing a broader financing solution. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in debt instruments of varying maturities. 
 
 Beginning in November 2022 and ending on January 30, 2023, the Fund entered into agreements with several investors pursuant to which such investors committed to purchase the Fund s Class I shares (the Private Placement ). The Private Placement was conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and was thus exempt from registration under the Securities Act as it was made only to investors (or advisors and/or managers of such investors) with whom the Fund s investment adviser had substantive pre-existing relationships, as each of such investors (or such investor s advisors and/or managers) was known by the Fund s investment adviser (or persons acting on the Fund s investment adviser's behalf due to a prior investment relationship with entities affiliated with Ares Management, and who are accredited investors pursuant to Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. 
 
 Pursuant to such agreements entered into between the Fund and each investor in connection with the Private Placement, the investors participating in the Private Placement (the Private Placement Investors committed to purchase Class I shares at an initial offering price of per share, to be adjusted following the initial drawdown of such Private Placement Investors subscriptions to a price equal to the net asset value NAV per share as of the most recently completed month-end prior to the date of such drawdown. 
 
 The Fund publicly offers on a continuous basis up to billion of its common shares, including Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares Common Shares ), pursuant to an offering (the Offering registered with the Securities and 
 53 

billion of its Common Shares. The share classes have different ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees. Prior to receiving the exemptive relief order, the Fund only offered and sold Class I shares and did not offer any Class S or Class D shares. The purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the Fund s NAV per share, as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase. The Offering is a best efforts offering, which means that Ares Wealth Management Solutions, LLC AWMS ), the intermediary manager for the Offering and an affiliate of the Fund s investment adviser, will use its best efforts to sell Common Shares, but is not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares. The Fund also engages in offerings of its unregistered Common Shares to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act.

 The base management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Fund s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the investment advisory and management agreement, net assets means the Fund s total assets less liabilities, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. 
 
 (i) Income Based Fee 
 
 The portion of the incentive fee based on the Fund s income is based on pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets in accordance with GAAP at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement entered into between the Fund and the Fund s administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees). 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market or original issue discount, debt investments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. The Fund s investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Fund for any part of the income based fee it receives that are based on accrued interest income that the Fund never actually receives. Pre-incentive fee net investment income is not adjusted for incentive fee payments or any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee payments by the Class S shares and the Class D shares. Accordingly, pre-incentive fee net investment income may be calculated on higher amounts of income than the Fund may ultimately realize and that may ultimately be distributed to common shareholders. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from pre-incentive fee net investment income. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement below. Because of the structure of the income based fee, it is possible that the Fund may pay such fees in a quarter where it incurs a loss. For example, if the Fund receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate for a quarter, the Fund will pay the applicable income based fee even if the Fund has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized losses. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter annualized). 
 
 The Fund pays its investment adviser an income based fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Fund s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which the Fund s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized); 
 
 of the dollar amount of Fund s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up . The catch-up is meant to provide the Fund s investment adviser with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 59 

of the dollar amount of the Fund s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter are allocated to the investment adviser. 
 
 The fees that are payable under the investment advisory and management agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant period. 
 
 (ii) Capital Gains Incentive Fee 
 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable in arrears at the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Fund is required by GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment by the Fund (including, for example, as a result of the application of the asset acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall be an amount (the Contractual Cost Basis equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by the Fund for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in the Fund s consolidated financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in the Fund s consolidated financial statements, including PIK interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in the Fund s consolidated financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with GAAP) at the time of acquisition. 
 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof. If the investment advisory and management agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. 
 
 The fees that are payable under the investment advisory and management agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant period. 
 
 Income based fee Capital gains incentive fee(1) 
 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) Calculated in accordance with GAAP as discussed below. 
 
 There was capital gains incentive fee payable to the Fund s investment adviser as calculated under the investment advisory and management agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the Fund had cumulatively accrued a capital gains incentive fee of as of September 30, 2024. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory and management agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative 
 60 

of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fee paid or capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. As of September 30, 2024, the Fund has paid capital gains incentive fee since inception totaling . The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. 
 
 The services of all investment professionals and staff of the Fund s investment adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to the Fund, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Fund s investment adviser.

No shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid with respect to Class I shares. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are payable to the Intermediary Manager, but the Intermediary Manager anticipates that all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers. 
 
 The Intermediary Manager is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member of the FINRA.

 Interest Rate Swap 
 
 In connection with the August 2029 Notes, the Fund entered into an interest rate swap agreement to more closely align the interest rate of such liability with the Fund s investment portfolio, which consists primarily of floating rate loans. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Fund receives a fixed interest rate and pays a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus an applicable spread, as disclosed below. The Fund designated this interest rate swap and the August 2029 Notes as a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship.

 See Note 5 for more information on the August 2029 Notes. See Note 11 for a subsequent event relating to an additional interest rate swap in connection with an additional issuance of unsecured notes. 
 
 As a result of the Fund s designation of the interest rate swap as the hedging instrument in a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship, the Fund is required to fair value the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, with the changes in the fair value of each being recorded in interest expense. The net gain related to the fair value hedge was approximately and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which is included in interest and credit facility fees in the Fund s consolidated statement of operations.

 The Fund s commitment to fund delayed draw loans is generally triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).

Changes in market yields, discount rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of the Fund s investments. Generally, an increase in market yields or discount rates or decrease in EBITDA multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of the Fund s investments. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Fund s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Fund s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Fund may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Fund was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Fund has recorded it. 
 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) in each quarter. The Fund s board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in its best interest and the best interest of its common shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or at all. The Fund conducts any such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Investment Company Act, with the terms of such tender offer published in a tender offer statement to be sent to all shareholders and filed with the SEC on Schedule TO. All common shareholders will be given at least full business days to elect to participate in such share repurchases. All shares purchased by the Fund, pursuant to the terms of each tender offer, will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 
 Under the Fund s share repurchase program, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, the Fund expects to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable month designated by the Fund s board of trustees, except that the Fund deducts from such NAV for shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year (the Early Repurchase Deduction ).

T he Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests: (i) arising from the death or qualified disability of the holder; (ii) submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements); (iii) from feeder funds (or similar vehicles) primarily created to hold the Fund's Common Shares, which are offered to non-U.S. persons, where such funds seek to avoid imposing such a deduction because of administrative or systems limitations; and (iv) in the event that a shareholder's Common Shares are repurchased because the shareholder has failed to maintain a minimum account balance. Prior to May 8, 2024, the Fund could only waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 In October 2024, the Fund issued in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on February 15, 2030 and bear interest at a rate of per annum (the February 2030 Notes ). The February 2030 Notes were sold to initial purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and for the resale by such initial purchasers to (i) qualified institutional buyers in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A thereunder or (ii) certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The February 2030 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. The February 2030 Notes pay interest semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2025, and all principal is due upon maturity. The February 2030 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at the Fund s option at a redemption price equal to par plus a make whole premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the February 2030 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 Concurrent with the issuance of the February 2030 Notes, the Fund entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement for the benefit of the initial purchasers of the February 2030 Notes. Pursuant to the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Fund is obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange the February 2030 Notes for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act with terms substantially identical to those of the February 2030 Notes (except for provisions relating to transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such exchange offer on the earliest practicable date after the registration statement has been declared effective but in no event later than October 2, 2025. Alternatively, in accordance with the terms of the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Fund may consummate such exchange offer through the use of an existing registration statement. If the Fund fails to satisfy its registration obligations under the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the February 2030 Notes. 
 
 In connection with the February 2030 Notes, the Fund entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a total notional amount of that matures on February 15, 2030 to more closely align the interest rate of such liability with the Fund s investment portfolio, which consists primarily of floating rate loans. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Fund receives a fixed interest rate of and pays a floating interest rate based on one-month SOFR plus . The Fund designated this interest rate swap and the February 2030 Notes in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship. See Note 6 for more information on the interest rate swap.

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end management investment company. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on March 15, 2022, we have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act ). 
 
 We are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC Ares Capital Management or our investment adviser ), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE:ARES) Ares Management or Ares ), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement (the investment advisory and management agreement ). Our investment adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our investment adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. Our administrator, Ares Operations LLC Ares Operations or our administrator ), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate. 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans, second lien senior secured loans, subordinated secured and unsecured loans, subordinated debt, which in some cases include equity and/or preferred components, and other types of credit instruments which may include commercial real estate mezzanine loans, real estate mortgages, distressed investments, securitized products, notes, bills, debentures, bank loans, convertible and preferred securities, infrastructure debt and government and municipal obligations, made to or issued by U.S. middle-market companies, which we generally define as companies with annual EBITDA between 10 million and 250 million. As used herein, EBITDA represents annual net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect that a majority of our investments will be in directly originated loans. For cash management and other purposes, we also intend to invest in broadly syndicated loans and other more liquid credit investments, including in publicly traded debt instruments and other instruments that are not directly originated. We primarily invest in illiquid and restricted investments, and while most of our investments are expected to be in private U.S. companies (we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including private U.S. companies), we may also invest from time to time in non-U.S. companies. Our portfolio may also include equity securities such as common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options, which may be obtained as part of providing a broader financing solution. Under normal circumstances, we will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in debt instruments of varying maturities. 
 
 To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our investment adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions, including any potential borrowings under our Facilities (as defined below) and the issuance of debt securities. We may also use leverage in the form of 
 90 

the issuance of preferred shares, but do not currently intend to do so. In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. Any such leverage, if incurred, would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by us. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us in our Annual Report. To finance investments, we may securitize certain of our secured loans or other investments, including through the formation of one or more collateralized loan obligations, while retaining all or most of the exposure to the performance of these investments. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We may form or invest in one or more CLOs, which may subject us to certain structured financing risks in our Annual Report. Our investments are subject to a number of risks. See Risk Factors" below and Risk Factors in our Annual Report. 
 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30 basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we, our investment adviser and certain of our affiliates have received an exemptive relief order from the SEC that permits us and other BDCs and registered closed-end management investment companies managed by Ares Management and its affiliates to co-invest in portfolio companies with each other and with affiliated investment funds (the Co-Investment Exemptive Order ). Co-investments made under the Co-Investment Exemptive Order are subject to compliance with certain conditions and other requirements, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also otherwise co-invest with funds managed by Ares Management or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our investment adviser s allocation policy. 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our shareholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders provided that we satisfy those requirements. 
 
 MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, leveraged corporate credit markets posted positive returns, driven by sustained economic growth, a healthy level of corporate earnings and further stability in the capital markets and U.S. banking system. With easing inflationary measures, the Federal Reserve softened its monetary policies and lowered the federal funds rate in support of its goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to its two percent objective. 

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY 
 
 Our investment activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below.

 (1) New investment commitments include new agreements to fund revolving loans or delayed draw loans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our commitments to fund revolving loans or delayed draw loans. 
 
 (2) Includes both funded and unfunded commitments. Of these new investment commitments, we funded approximately 2.7 billion and 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 (3) Includes funded commitments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, investment commitments exited included exits of unfunded commitments of 5.1 million and 2.3 million, respectively. 
 
 (4) Weighted average yield is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing investments, divided by (b) the total accruing investments at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments consisted of the following:

 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) The amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for any accretion of discounts, amortization of premiums and PIK interest or dividends. 
 
 Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels). We are also party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our unfunded commitments. 
 
 The weighted average yields at amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Debt and other income producing securities(1) 9.9 9.9 10.7 10.6 Total portfolio(2) 9.8 9.7 10.5 10.4 First lien senior secured loans(3) 9.8 9.7 10.6 10.5 Second lien senior secured loans(3) 10.9 11.0 12.8 12.6 Senior subordinated loans(3) 14.7 13.9 15.4 15.3 Corporate bonds(3) 9.4 8.6 9.4 9.0 Collateralized loan obligations(3) 12.2 12.1 10.2 10.1 Commercial mortgage-backed securities(3) 10.8 10.5 10.4 10.4 Private asset-backed investments(3) 10.5 10.3 11.2 11.2 Other income producing equity securities(4) 12.5 11.8 9.0 8.9 
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 (1) Weighted average yields on debt and other income producing securities are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total accruing debt and other income producing securities at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable. 
 
 (2) Weighted average yields on total portfolio are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) total investments at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable. 
 
 93 

(3) Weighted average yields of investments are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing investments, divided by (b) the total relevant investments at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable. 
 
 (4) Weighted average yield on other income producing equity securities is computed as (a) the yield earned on the relevant income producing equity securities, divided by (b) the total relevant income producing equity securities at amortized cost or fair value, as applicable. 
 
 Ares Capital Management employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. The following is a description of each investment grade: 
 
 Investment grade Description 4 Involves the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 3 Involves a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. 2 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. For investments graded 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 1 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 
 Set forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands) Fair Value Number of Companies Fair Value Number of Companies Grade 4 60,695 0.8 3 0.7 15,112 0.6 1 0.4 Grade 3 7,250,810 99.1 448 98.9 2,557,743 99.2 257 99.2 Grade 2 782 1 0.2 4,703 0.2 1 0.4 Grade 1 3,736 0.1 1 0.2 Total 7,316,023 100.0 453 100.0 2,577,558 100.0 259 100.0 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average grade of the investments in our portfolio at fair value was 3.0 and 3.0, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, loans on non-accrual status represented 0.1 of the total investments at amortized cost (or 0.1 at fair value). As of December 31, 2023, there were no loans on non-accrual status. 

KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 94 

Revenues 
 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as realized gains. Dividend income on preferred equity, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 The services of all investment professionals and staff of our investment adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by our investment adviser. Under the investment advisory and management agreement, we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on fees and expenses. 
 
 From time to time, our investment adviser, our administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse our investment adviser, our administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, our investment adviser or our administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. 
 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 We have entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with our investment adviser. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement.

 Stated interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. Our weighted average stated interest rate on debt outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the higher debt outstanding, which was entirely floating rate. Average debt outstanding and weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average debt outstanding 1,611,826 233,039 1,146,085 172,837 Weighted average stated interest rate on debt outstanding(1) 7.5 7.3 7.6 7.1 
 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) The weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the impact of an interest rate swap. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the interest rate swap. 
 
 The base management fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio. 
 
 The income based fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 being higher than in the comparable periods in 2023. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was 0.2 million and 4.8 million, respectively, and 0.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 changed from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to net gains on investments and foreign currency transactions of 38.5 million compared to approximately 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 7.9 million of capital gains incentive fee accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of September 30, 2024, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. 
 
 Our investment adviser agreed not to seek recoupment of any base management fee and incentive fee from the commencement of operations through July 31, 2023. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the base management fee, income based fee and capital gains incentive fee. 
 
 Offering expenses include expenses incurred in connection with our continuous offering of Common Shares (as defined below). Administrative and other fees represent fees paid to Ares Operations and our investment adviser for our 
 97 

allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Ares Operations and our investment adviser, in performing their obligations under each of the administration agreement and the investment advisory and management agreement, respectively, including our allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of our corporate officers and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the administrative and other fees. Other general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent trustees fees. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total other expenses was approximately 5.4 million and 17.3 million, respectively, which is comprised of shareholder servicing and distribution fees, administrative and other fees, offering expenses and other general and administrative expenses, compared to 4.2 million and 7.7 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. Administrative and other fees and other general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from comparable periods in 2023, primarily as a result of the continued portfolio growth. Other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023, primarily as a result of our continuous registered offering of Common Shares, which began on August 1, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes. 
 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an expense of 0.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax, compared to 0.4 million and 0.4 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. 
 
 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains/Losses 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net realized gains on investments of 3.8 million and 11.9 million, respectively, compared to 2.3 million and 4.2 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023, primarily from full or partial sales of our debt investments. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net unrealized gains on investments of 2.2 million and 30.7 million, respectively, compared to 4.0 million and 6.9 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recognized net unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of 4.7 million and 4.3 million, respectively. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our current liquidity and capital resources are expected to be generated primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of common shares of beneficial interest, including Class I shares, Class S shares and Class D shares Common Shares ), pursuant to our registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-264145) declared effective by the SEC on April 24, 2023 (as amended and supplemented, the Registration Statement on a continuous basis at a price per share equal to the then-current net asset value NAV per share, cash flows from our operations and advances from our credit facilities (the Revolving Credit Facility, the SG Funding Facility and SB Funding Facility (each as defined below, and together, the Facilities )). Further, we expect to generate additional liquidity and capital resources from the net proceeds of any future offerings of our debt or equity securities, including unsecured notes and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. 
 
 Our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying our investment adviser and our administrator), (iii) the cost of any borrowings or other financing arrangements and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our Common Shares. 
 
 98 

In accordance with the Investment Company Act, we may borrow amounts such that our asset coverage calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 (or 200 if certain requirements under the Investment Company Act are not met) immediately after such borrowing (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us). As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 58 million in cash and cash equivalents and 2.2 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding 2.2 billion at carrying value) and our asset coverage was 315 . Subject to borrowing base and other restrictions, we had approximately 2.9 billion available for additional borrowings under the Facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We have implemented a share repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to offer to repurchase, at the discretion of our board of trustees, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) in each quarter. We conduct any such repurchases of our Common Shares pursuant to the terms of tender offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act, with the terms of such tender offer published in a tender offer statement to be sent to all shareholders and filed with the SEC on Schedule TO. We may from time to time seek to retire, cancel or purchase any of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into new debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of common stock or outstanding debt, or incurrence or issuance of additional debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our short-term investments, our available borrowing capacity under the Facilities and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations in the near term. 
 
 Equity Capital Activities 
 
 Pursuant to subscription agreements providing for the commitment to purchase an aggregate of up to 847.1 million of our Class I shares entered into between us and several investors between November 2022 and ending on January 30, 2023 (the Seed Investment Agreements ), we called an aggregate of 847.1 million from October 6, 2022 through July 31, 2023, and in exchange therefore, we issued approximately 32,402,451 Class I shares to 61 shareholders, including the investment from our sole initial shareholder. 
 
 On August 1, 2023, we held the first closing in the offering of Common Shares, pursuant to our Registration Statement. We publicly offer on a continuous basis up to 7.5 billion of our Common Shares, pursuant to an offering (the Offering registered with the SEC. The purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals to our NAV per share, as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase. Ares Wealth Management Solutions, LLC, our intermediary manager, will use its best efforts to sell Common Shares, but is not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of Common Shares in the Offering. We also engage in offerings of our unregistered Common Shares to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act.

 Net Asset Value Per Share and Offering Price 
 
 We determine NAV for each class of shares as of the last day of each calendar month. Share issuances related to monthly subscriptions are effective the first calendar day of each month. The NAV per share for each class of Common Shares is determined by dividing the value of total assets attributable to the class minus liabilities attributable to the share class by the total number of each share class of Common Shares outstanding at the date as of which the determination is made. The following table summarizes each month-end NAV per share for Class I, Class S and Class D shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 See Recent Developments as well as Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for a subsequent event relating to regular distributions declared by our board of trustees. 
 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 101 

We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan distribution reinvestment plan ), pursuant to which we will not reinvest cash distributions declared by our board of trustees on behalf of our shareholders unless such shareholders elect for their shares to be automatically reinvested. As a result, if our board of trustees authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our shareholders who have opted into our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account. The purchase price for shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the most recent available NAV per share for such shares at the time the distribution is payable. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 We have implemented a share repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to offer to repurchase, at the discretion of our board of trustees, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) in each quarter. Our board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our common shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or at all. We will conduct any such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Investment Company Act, with the terms of such tender offer published in a tender offer statement to be sent to all our shareholders and filed with the SEC on Schedule TO. All our common shareholders will be given at least 20 full business days to elect to participate in such share repurchases. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer, will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable month designated by our board of trustees, except that we deduct 2.00 from such NAV for shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year (the Early Repurchase Deduction ). 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we amended and restated the plan adopted by us pursuant to Rule 18f-3 under the Investment Company Act so we may issue multiple classes of Common Shares (the Multiple Class Plan to provide that the Early Repurchase Deduction holding period ends on the one-year anniversary of the subscription closing date and the Early Repurchase Deduction will not apply to shares acquired through our distribution reinvestment plan. T he Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests: (i) arising from the death or qualified disability of the holder; (ii) submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements); (iii) from feeder funds (or similar vehicles) primarily created to hold our Common Shares, which are offered to non-U.S. persons, where such funds seek to avoid imposing such a deduction because of administrative or systems limitations; and (iv) in the event that a shareholder s Common Shares are repurchased because the shareholder has failed to maintain a minimum account balance. Prior to May 8, 2024, we could only waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by us for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to tender offers, we repurchased 58,693 Class I shares and 75,055 Class S shares for a total value of approximately 1.6 million and 2.0 million, respectively, which is net of the Early Repurchase Deduction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to tender offers, we repurchased 441,177 Class I shares and 84,715 Class S shares for a total value of approximately 11.8 million and 2.3 million, respectively, each of which are net of the Early Repurchase Deduction. No Class D shares were repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date were April 15, 2028 and April 15, 2029, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility also provided for a feature that allowed us, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of approximately 2.6 billion. The interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 (or an alternate rate of interest for certain loans, commitments and/or other extensions of credit denominated in approved foreign currencies plus a spread adjustment, if applicable) and an applicable spread of either 1.75 or 1.875 or an alternate base rate (as defined in the documents governing the Revolving Credit Facility) plus an applicable spread of 0.75 or 0.875 , in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the aggregate amount of revolving exposure under the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 85 of the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total revolving exposure) plus (ii) other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable spread in effect was 1.75 . We are also required to pay a letter of credit fee of 0.25 per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total 
 103 

commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375 per annum on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 380 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. See Recent Developments, as well as Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for a subsequent event relating to the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 SG Funding Facility 
 
 We and our wholly owned subsidiary, ASIF Funding I, LLC ASIF Funding I are a party to a revolving funding facility with Soci t G n rale and each of the other parties thereto (the SG Funding Facility ), that provides for a facility amount of approximately 1.8 billion. The end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are August 28, 2027 and August 28, 2029, respectively. The SG Funding Facility also provides for a feature that allows ASIF Funding I, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the SG Funding Facility to a maximum of 2.0 billion. The interest rate charged on the SG Funding Facility is based on SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.05 per annum. In addition to the stated interest expense, ASIF Funding I is required to pay, among other fees, a daily commitment fee on any monthly distribution date, termination date or on the date of any payment or prepayment of a loan outstanding under the SG Funding Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was 695 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the SG Funding Facility and we and ASIF Funding I were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the SG Funding Facility. 
 
 SB Funding Facility 
 
 We and our wholly owned subsidiary, ASIF Funding II, LLC ASIF Funding II are party to a revolving funding facility with the Bank of Nova Scotia and each of the other parties thereto (the SB Funding Facility ), that provides for a facility amount of 750 million. The end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date are September 1, 2026 and March 1, 2033, respectively. The interest rate charged on the SB Funding Facility is based on SOFR plus an applicable margin of (i) 2.10 during the reinvestment period and (ii) 2.40 following the reinvestment period. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable spread in effect was 2.10 . In addition, ASIF Funding II is required to pay, among other fees, a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum on any unused portion of the SB Funding Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was 375 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the SB Funding Facility and we and ASIF Funding II were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the SB Funding Facility. 
 
 Unsecured Notes 
 
 In June 2024, we issued 700 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 6.350 per annum (the August 2029 Notes ). The August 2029 Notes were sold to initial purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and for the resale by such initial purchasers to (i) qualified institutional buyers in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A thereunder or (ii) certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The August 2029 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. The August 2029 Notes pay interest semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2025, and all principal is due upon maturity. The August 2029 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to par plus a make whole premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the August 2029 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. The August 2029 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount. 
 
 Concurrent with the issuance of the August 2029 Notes, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the August 2029 Notes Registration Rights Agreement for the benefit of the initial purchasers of the August 2029 Notes. Pursuant to the August 2029 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, we are obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange the August 2029 Notes for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act with terms substantially identical to those of the August 2029 Notes (except for provisions relating to transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such exchange offer on the earliest practicable date after the registration statement has been declared effective but in no event later than June 5, 2025. If we fail to satisfy our registration obligations under the August 2029 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the August 2029 Notes. 
 
 104 

In connection with the August 2029 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to more closely align the interest rate of such liability with our investment portfolio, which consists primarily of floating rate loans. We designated this interest rate swap and the August 2029 Notes as a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship. Certain information related to our interest rate swap instrument as of September 30, 2024 is presented below (dollar amounts in thousands).

 See Recent Developments, as well as Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for a subsequent event relating to an additional issuance of unsecured notes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the indenture governing the August 2029 Notes. 
 
 The August 2029 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the August 2029 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 In October 2024, we increased the total commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility from 1.785 billion to 1.810 billion. The other terms of the Revolving Credit Facility remained unchanged. 
 
 In October 2024, we, through a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary, priced a 476 million term debt securitization. The transaction is expected to close in November 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Term debt securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is a form of secured financing incurred by us, which is consolidated by us and subject to its overall asset coverage requirement. 
 
 In October 2024, we issued 750 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on February 15, 2030 and bear interest at a rate of 5.600 per annum (the February 2030 Notes ). The February 2030 Notes were sold to initial purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and for the resale by such initial purchasers to (i) qualified institutional buyers in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A thereunder or (ii) certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The February 2030 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. The February 2030 Notes pay interest semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2025, and all principal is due upon maturity. The February 2030 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option at a redemption price equal to par plus a make whole premium, if applicable, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the February 2030 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 Concurrent with the issuance of the February 2030 Notes, we entered into the Registration Rights Agreement (the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement for the benefit of the initial purchasers of the February 2030 Notes. Pursuant to the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, we are obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange the February 2030 Notes for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act with terms substantially identical to those of the February 2030 Notes (except for provisions relating to transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such exchange offer on the earliest practicable date after the registration statement has been declared effective but in no event later than October 2, 2025. If we fail to satisfy our registration obligations under the February 2030 Notes Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to pay additional interest to the holders of the February 2030 Notes. 
 
 In connection with the February 2030 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a total notional amount of 750 million that matures on February 15, 2030 to more closely align the interest rate of such liability with our 
 105 

investment portfolio, which consists primarily of floating rate loans. Under the interest rate swap agreement, we receive a fixed interest rate of 5.600 and pay a floating interest rate based on one-month SOFR plus 2.302 . We designated this interest rate swap and the February 2030 Notes as a qualifying hedge accounting relationship. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we issued and sold 13,252,580 Common Shares (consisting of 10,846,830 Class I shares, 1,002,028 Class S shares and 1,403,722 Class D shares at an offering price of 27.45 per share for each class of share), and we received approximately 364 million as payment for such shares. 
 
 We received approximately 503 million of net proceeds relating to the issuance of Class I shares, Class S shares and Class D shares for subscriptions effective November 1, 2024. The purchase price per Class I share, Class S share and Class D share will equal our NAV per Class I share, Class S share and Class D share, respectively, as of the last calendar day of October 2024 (the October NAV ), which is generally expected to be available within 20 business days after November 1, 2024. At that time, the number of Class I shares, Class S shares and Class D shares issued to each investor based on the October NAV and such investor s subscription amount will be determined and Class I shares, Class S shares and Class D shares, as applicable, will be credited to the investor s account as of the effective date of the share purchase, November 1, 2024. 
 
 As previously disclosed, on August 13, 2024, we announced the declaration of regular monthly gross distributions for October, November and December 2024. On November 8, 2024, we announced the declaration of regular monthly gross distributions for January, February and March 2025, in each case for each class of its Common Shares. The following table presents the regular monthly gross distributions per share that were declared and payable: 
 
 Gross Distribution Per Share Record Date Payment Date(1) Class I Class S Class D October 31, 2024 November 22, 2024 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 November 29, 2024 December 26, 2024 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 December 31, 2024 January 23, 2025 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 January 31, 2025 February 21, 2025 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 February 28, 2025 March 21, 2025 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 March 31, 2025 April 21, 2025 0.21430 0.21430 0.21430 
 ______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 (1) The distributions for each class of our Common Shares will be paid on or about the payment dates above. 
 
 These distributions will be paid in cash or reinvested in our Common Shares for shareholders participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. The net distributions received by shareholders of each of the Class S shares and Class D shares will be equal to the gross distribution in the table above, less specific shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees applicable to such class of our Common Shares as of their respective record dates. Class I shares have no shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 This discussion of our expected operating plans is based upon our expected consolidated financial statements, which will be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements will require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our critical accounting policies. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 106 

Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, our board of trustees has designated our investment adviser as our valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to perform fair value determinations for investments held by us without readily available market quotations, subject to the oversight by our board of trustees. All investments are recorded at their fair value. 
 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Valuation Designee looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third party valuation providers IVPs that have been engaged to support the valuation of such portfolio investments at least quarterly (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our investment valuation process within the context of performing our financial statement audit. 
 
 Investments in our portfolio that do not have a readily available market are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, as described herein. As part of the valuation process for investments that do not have readily available market prices, the Valuation Designee may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, the Valuation Designee considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 
 
 The Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees, undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 
 Our quarterly valuation process begins with a preliminary valuation being prepared by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team and valuation team. 
 
 Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed by the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee. 
 
 For portfolio investments selected for review by an IVP, 
 
 Relevant information related to the portfolio investment is made available by the Valuation Designee to the IVP, who does not independently verify such information. 
 
 The IVP reviews and analyzes the information provided by the Valuation Designee, along with relevant market and economic data, and independently determines a range of values for each of the selected portfolio investments. 
 
 The IVP provides its analysis to the Valuation Designee to support the IVP s valuation methodology and calculations. 
 
 107 

The valuation committee of the Valuation Designee determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the IVPs, where applicable. 
 
 For portfolio investments selected for review by an IVP, a positive assurance opinion or independent valuation report is issued by the IVP that confirms the fair value determined by the Valuation Designee for a selected portfolio investment is within the range of values independently calculated by such IVP. 
 
 When the Valuation Designee determines our NAV as of the last day of a month that is not also the last day of a calendar quarter, the Valuation Designee intends to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, the Valuation Designee will generally value such assets at the most recent quarterly valuation unless the Valuation Designee determines that a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment (which determination may be as a result of a material event at a portfolio company, material change in market spreads, secondary market transaction in the securities of an investment or otherwise). If the Valuation Designee determines such a change has occurred with respect to one or more investments, the Valuation Designee will determine whether to update the value for each relevant investment. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 We follow ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ASC 825-10 ), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of our choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled other assets and debt, which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value. 
 
 We also follow ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ), which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 
 
 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 
 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 
 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Valuation Designee continues to employ the net asset valuation policy and procedures that have been reviewed by our board of trustees in connection with their designation of our investment adviser as our valuation designee and are consistent with the provisions of Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and ASC 820-10. Consistent with its valuation policies and procedures, the Valuation Designee evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Because there may not be a readily available market value for some of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of a portion of our investments may be determined using unobservable inputs. 
 
 Our portfolio investments classified as Level 3 are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value EV of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the 
 108 

enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Valuation Designee may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where we do not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, the Valuation Designee considers the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of us and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Valuation Designee depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable. 
 
 See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our valuation process. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to the fluctuations in global interest rates, inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine war and more recently the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For more information concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors General Risk Factors Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations , Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Investments Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results and Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure Inflation has adversely affected the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies in our Annual Report. 
 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged to support the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least quarterly (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates as well as Notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 109 

Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates including the current rising interest rate environment in our Annual Report. 
 
 In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 93 of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates, 5 bore interest at fixed rate and 2 were non-income producing. Additionally, 73 of the variable rate investments at fair value contained interest rate floors. The Facilities bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors. The August 2029 Notes have been swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate through the interest rate swap. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our debt obligations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on the interest rate swap. 
 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 (in millions) Basis Point Change Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income(1) Up 300 basis points 206 65 141 Up 200 basis points 138 43 95 Up 100 basis points 69 22 47 Down 100 basis points (69) (22) (47) Down 200 basis points (138) (43) (95) Down 300 basis points (206) (65) (141)

 Section 1.3 Assumptions and Calculations with respect to Collateral Loans . In connection with all calculations required to be made pursuant to this Agreement with respect to Scheduled Distributions on any Collateral Loans, or any payments on any other assets included in the Collateral, with respect to the sale of and reinvestment in Collateral Loans, and with respect to the income that can be earned on Scheduled Distributions on such Collateral Loans and on any other amounts that may be received for deposit in the Collection Account, the provisions set forth in this Section 1.3 shall be applied. The provisions of this Section 1.3 shall be applicable to any determination or calculation that is covered by this Section 1.3, whether or not reference is specifically made to Section 1.3, unless some other method of calculation or determination is expressly specified in the particular provision. 
 
 (a) Scheduled interest due on Collateral Loans on which payments are subject to foreign withholding taxes will be the minimum net amount to be received after giving effect to the maximum permitted withholding and to any gross-up payments required to be made by the related Obligor pursuant to such loan's Related Contracts. 
 
 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all monetary calculations under this Agreement shall be in Dollars. 
 
 (c) The determination of the percentage of Total Capitalization that would be represented by a specified type of Collateral Loans will be calculated by dividing the Aggregate Maximum Principal Balance of such specified type of Collateral Loans by Total Capitalization. For purposes of this Section 1.3(c), a type of Collateral Loan shall correspond to each clause of the definition of Concentration Limitations and clause (d) of the definition of Eligibility Criteria . 
 
 (d) Any portion of a Collateral Loan or other loan or security owned of record by the Borrower that has been assigned by the Borrower to a third party and released from the Lien of this 
 -69- 

Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof shall no longer constitute Collateral or a Collateral Loan hereunder. 
 
 (e) For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests, except as otherwise specified in the Coverage Tests, such calculations will not include scheduled interest and principal payments on Defaulted Loans unless or until such payments are actually made. 
 
 (f) For each Due Period and as of any date of determination, the Scheduled Distribution on any Collateral Loans (other than Defaulted Loans, which, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections to be received during such Due Period in respect of such Collateral Loans (including the proceeds of the sale of such Collateral Loans received and, in the case of sales which have not yet settled, to be received during such Due Period) and not reinvested in additional Collateral Loans or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 8.2 that, if received as scheduled, will be available in the Collection Account at the end of such Due Period and (ii) any such amounts received in prior Due Periods that were not disbursed on a previous Monthly Quarterly Payment Date or retained in the Collection Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 8.2. 
 
 (g) Each Scheduled Distribution receivable with respect to a Collateral Loan shall be assumed to be received on the applicable Due Date, and each such Scheduled Distribution shall be assumed to be immediately deposited in the Collection Account to earn interest at the Assumed Reinvestment Rate. All such funds shall be assumed to continue to earn interest until the date on which they are required to be available in the Collection Account for application, in accordance with the terms hereof, to payments of principal of or interest on the Loans or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. 
 
 (h) References in the Priority of Payments to calculations made on a pro forma basis shall mean such calculations after giving effect to all payments, in accordance with the Priority of Payments, that precede (in priority of payment) or include the clause in which such calculation is made. 
 
 (i) For purposes of calculating all Concentration Limitations, in the numerator of any component of the Concentration Limitations, Defaulted Loans will be treated as having a Maximum Principal Balance equal to zero. 
 
 (j) Except as otherwise provided herein, Defaulted Loans will not be included in the calculation of the Collateral Quality Test. 
 
 (k) For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests, the Collateral Quality Test and the Concentration Limitations, capitalized or deferred interest (and any other interest that is not paid in cash) on Collateral Loans will be excluded other than any capitalized or deferred interest that is acquired using Principal Proceeds or the proceeds of any Funding. 
 
 (l) Portions of the same Collateral Loan acquired by the Borrower on different dates (whether through purchase, receipt by contribution or the making thereof, but excluding subsequent draws under Revolving Collateral Loans or Delayed Funding Loans) will, for purposes of determining the purchase price of such Collateral Loan, be treated as separate purchases on separate dates (and not a weighted average purchase price for any particular Collateral Loan). 
 
 (m) For purposes of calculating the Weighted Average Spread or Weighted Average Coupon, (i) a Collateral Loan that is a Step-Down Loan will be treated as having the lowest per annum interest rate or spread over the applicable index or benchmark rate over the remaining maturity of such 
 -70- 

Collateral Loan and (ii) a Collateral Loan that is a Step-Up Loan will be treated as having the then current per annum interest rate or spread over the applicable index or benchmark rate. 
 
 (n) For purposes of calculating compliance with any tests under this Agreement (including without limitation the Coverage Tests, the Collateral Quality Test, Portfolio Advance Rate Test and the Concentration Limitations), the trade date (and not the settlement date) with respect to any acquisition or disposition of a Collateral Loan or Eligible Investment shall be used to determine whether and when such acquisition or disposition has occurred. 
 
 (o) For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to satisfy the Eligibility Criteria upon the acquisition of a debt obligation or a breach of Section 5.12 shall not occur solely as a result of any property of an Obligor being subject to a Lien imposed by law, such as materialmen's, warehousemen's, mechanics', carriers', workmen's and repairmen's Liens and other similar Liens, arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business for sums that are not overdue or are being contested in good faith. 
 
 (p) All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Collateral Loans shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each such Collateral Loan and upon reports of payments, if any, received on such Collateral Loan that are furnished by or on behalf of the issuer of such Collateral Loan and, to the extent they are not manifestly in error or the Servicer does not have actual knowledge of an error in such information or reports, such information or reports may be conclusively relied upon in making such calculations. 
 
 (q) If a Collateral Loan included in the Collateral would be deemed a Current Pay Obligation but for the applicable percentage limitation in the first proviso to the definition of Defaulted Loan, then the Current Pay Obligations with the lowest Market Value (expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal balance of such Current Pay Obligation as of the date of determination) will be deemed Defaulted Loans. Each such Defaulted Loans will be treated as a Defaulted Loan for all purposes until such time as the aggregate principal balance of Current Pay Obligations would not exceed, on a pro forma basis including such Defaulted Loan, the applicable percentage of Total Capitalization. 
 
 (r) For the purposes of the S&P CDO Monitor Test and all related definitions, the principal balance of any Equity Security shall be deemed to be zero. 
 
 (s) References in this Agreement to the Borrower's purchase or acquisition of a Collateral Loan include references to the Borrower's purchase, receipt by acquisition, receipt by contribution, making or origination of such Collateral Loan. With respect to Collateral Loan that is originated by the Borrower (x) if the net proceeds received by the applicable Obligor are equal to at least 95 of the par balance thereof, such Collateral Loan shall be deemed to have a purchase price of par and (y) if the net proceeds received by the applicable Obligor are less than 95 of the par balance thereof, such Collateral Loan shall be deemed to have a purchase price equal to the net proceeds received by the applicable Obligor. 
 
 (t) For the avoidance of doubt, each Ineligible Asset shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests, the Collateral Quality Test, the Concentration Limitations , the Total Capitalization, the Principal Collateralization Amount and the Portfolio Advance Rate Test. 
 
 (u) If the Borrower has entered into a binding commitment to purchase a Collateral Loan during the Reinvestment Period but such purchase has not settled prior to the end of the Reinvestment Period, such Collateral Loan will be treated as having been purchased by the Borrower prior to the end of the Reinvestment Period for purposes of the Eligibility Criteria. Not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the end of the Reinvestment Period, (i) the Servicer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a schedule of Collateral Loans purchased by the Borrower with respect to which 
 -71- 

purchases the trade date has occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred and (ii) shall certify to the Administrative Agent that sufficient Principal Proceeds are available (including, for this purpose, cash on deposit in the Collection Account that constitute Principal Proceeds, any scheduled or unscheduled principal payments that will be received by the Borrower from Collateral Loans with respect to which the related obligor has already delivered an irrevocable notice of repayment or which are required by the terms of the applicable Collateral Loans, as well as any Principal Proceeds that will be received by the Borrower from the sale of Collateral Loans for which the trade date has already occurred but the settlement date has not yet occurred) to effect the settlement of such Collateral Loans.

Furthermore, with respect to any instruction to the Collateral Agent hereunder relating to the transfer of amounts on deposit in any of the Covered Accounts, a copy of such instruction shall also be required to be given to the Collateral Administrator. Any direction or instruction referred to hereunder or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to constitute a Borrower Order for all purposes hereunder or thereunder.

 Within such limits and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow (and re-borrow) Revolving Loans under this Section 2.1 and prepay Revolving Loans under Section 2.7. Term Loans, once repaid, may not be reborrowed. 
 
 Each Revolving Lender severally agrees, on the last day of the Reinvestment Period (except if the Reinvestment Period terminates as a result of clause (b) or (d) of the definition thereof) to make a Revolving Loan (and the Borrower hereby directs that such Revolving Loan be made) in an amount equal to its Percentage Share of the Unfunded Amount (less the amount on deposit in the Future Funding Reserve Account) as of the date such Revolving Loan is made (such Revolving Loan, the Future Funding Reserve Loan ), but only to the extent that its Percentage Share of the Unfunded Amount does not exceed its Undrawn Commitment. The Borrower shall deposit the proceeds of such Loans in the Future Funding Reserve Account such that the amounts on deposit in the Future Funding Reserve Account equal the Unfunded Amount. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no Revolving Lender shall be required to make any Revolving Loans after the end of the Commitment Period. 
 
 Section 2.2 Making of the Loans .

 (d) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder for any Interest Period or portion thereof pursuant to this Section 2.5 and the related definitions provided that the relevant CP Lender, its Program Manager or its funding agent, as applicable, shall determine and announce to the Administrative Agent the Cost of Funds Rate for each Loan that is made by a CP Lender and to which the Cost of Funds Rate applies, such determination to be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower, the participating Lenders and the Collateral Agent of each rate of interest so determined and of all amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and its determinations thereof shall be conclusive in 
 -75- 

the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator or such Lender, as the case may be, a statement showing the reported

 immediately available funds provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Servicer (or any of its Affiliates) and the Lenders shall have the right to offer bids to acquire all or any portion of the Collateral sold at such sale.

 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 

-142- 

Section 11.1 Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair . 
 
 In the case of SOFR Loans, if on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, unless the Administrative Agent determines that a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred 
 
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 
 (b) the Controlling Parties advise the Administrative Agent that as a result of changes arising after the date of this Agreement with respect to Term SOFR, they have determined, in their commercially reasonable judgment, that a material disruption to Term SOFR or a change in the methodology of calculating Term SOFR has occurred, or the Controlling Parties advise the Administrative Agent that as a result of changes arising after the date of this Agreement, Term SOFR as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding or maintaining their SOFR Loans for such Interest Period, 
 
 in each case the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower, the Lenders , S&P and the Collateral Agent, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Collateral Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, which notice shall be given promptly upon the cessation of such circumstances, the obligations (if any) of the Lenders to fund SOFR Loans shall be suspended, except in the case of SOFR Loans required to fund Exposure Amounts provided that such Lenders shall instead fund Base Rate Loans, which Base Rate Loans shall convert to SOFR Loans immediately upon the cessation of such circumstances. 
 
 Section 11.2 Illegality . If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender in good faith with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund its SOFR Loans (if any) and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Lenders, the Collateral Agent , S&P and the Borrower, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, which notice shall be given promptly upon the cessation of such circumstances, the obligation of such Lender to fund SOFR Loans (if any) shall be suspended provided that such Lender shall instead fund Base Rate Loans (or in the case of outstanding Loans, such Loans will be converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of such Interest Period, or sooner if required by law)). Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 11.2, such Lender shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and would not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. If circumstances subsequently change so that it is no longer unlawful for an affected Lender to make or maintain SOFR Loans as contemplated hereunder, such Lender will, as soon as reasonably practicable after such Lender becomes aware of such change in circumstances, notify the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent and upon receipt of such notice, the obligations of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans shall be reinstated.

 (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Federal Reserve Board), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) any other condition affecting its SOFR Loans, its Loan Notes evidencing SOFR Loans, or its obligation to fund SOFR Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Loan Notes with respect thereto (other than any increased costs on account of (x) Indemnified Taxes or (y) Taxes described in the definition of Excluded Taxes ), such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction shall constitute Increased Costs payable by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) and 6.4 provided that such amounts shall be no greater than that which such Lender is generally charging other borrowers similarly situated to Borrower. 
 
 (b) If any Lender shall have determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding liquidity or capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand (which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such demand for compensation) by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and S&P), such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction (to the extent funds are available therefor in accordance with the Priority of Payments) shall constitute Increased Costs payable by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) and 6.4. 
 
 (c) Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 11.3 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not be, in the sole judgment of such Lender, otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate of any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 11.3 and setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be delivered in connection with any request for compensation and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation under this Section 11.3 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 11.3 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date on which the applicable Lender notifies the Borrower provided further that if the event giving rise to such increased costs or 
 -144- 

reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated (x) by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority), the Committee of European Banking Supervisors or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case, pursuant to Basel III or similar capital requirements directive existing on the Closing Date impacting European banks and other regulated financial institutions and (y) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act shall, in each case, be deemed to be a change or adoption of any law, rule or regulation for purposes of this Section 11.3, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. 
 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.3, the Borrower shall not be required to pay amounts to any Lender under this Section 11.3 to the extent such amounts would be duplicative of amounts payable by the Borrower under Section 11.4. To the extent the Borrower is required to pay any Lender additional amounts or indemnify any Lender in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to Section 11.4, the provisions of Section 11.4 shall control. 
 
 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay additional amounts to a Lender pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of this Section 11.3 to the extent any such additional amounts are attributable to a failure by an EU Affected Lender to comply with its obligations under the EU Securitisation Regulation that are within its control. 
 
 Section 11.4 Taxes . 
 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 11.4) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower . The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 
 (c) Indemnification by Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 15 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 11.4) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 
 -145- 

(d) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.6(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d). 
 
 (e) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 11.4, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 
 (f) Status of Lenders . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (A), (B) and (D) of Section 11.4(f)(ii)) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
 
 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax

 (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made and 
 
 (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 
 (h) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Section 11.4, all payments made pursuant to this Section 11.4 shall only be made to the extent funds are available in accordance with the Priority of Payments.

 Section 11.5 Replacement of Lender . 
 
 (a) (x) If and for so long as any Lender is (1) a Downgraded Lender (subject to clauses (b) and (c) below), (2) a Defaulting Lender, (3) requesting compensation under Section 11.3, (4) unable to make Loans under Section 11.2 or (5) a Non-Consenting Lender, (y) if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to such Lender or any authority for the account of such Lender pursuant to Section 11.4 or (z) if and for so long as the obligations of any Lender under this Agreement are the subject of a Bail-In Action, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender, the Agents and S&P, direct such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall comply with such direction but shall have no obligation to search for, seek, designate or otherwise try to find, an assignee), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.6), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Notes to a financial institution that is (I) (A) with respect to the Revolving Loans only, an Approved Lender and (B) is eligible to purchase the replaced Lender's Loans under the terms hereof, (II) not prohibited by any applicable law from making such purchase and (III) not the subject of a Bail-In Action 
 -148-

 (b) If and for so long as any Lender is a Downgraded Lender or a Defaulting Lender hereunder

 -149- 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 11.5(a) to the contrary, (i) a Lender shall not be required to make any assignment or delegation referred to in Section 11.5(a) if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or the Borrower or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply and such Lender gives notice thereof to the Borrower and (ii) the Borrower may not require a Downgraded Lender to make any such assignment or delegation during the 30-day period referred to in clause (b)(i) above or at any time that a Downgraded Lender is in compliance with clause (b)(i)(x) above. 
 
 (d) Each of the Administrative Agent and any replaced Lender will agree to cooperate with all reasonable requests of the Borrower for the purpose of effecting a transfer in compliance with this Section 11.5. 
 
 (e) Nothing in this Section 11.5 shall be deemed to release a Defaulting Lender or Downgraded Lender from any liability arising from its failure to fund any Loans it is required to make hereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to acquire or underwrite the Loans of any Non-Consenting Lender and any costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent under this 11.5(g) shall be deemed to be Administrative Expenses payable to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Priority of Payments. The failure by the Administrative Agent to find an Approved Purchaser shall not be a breach of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent. 
 
 (h) Any amounts incurred in connection with this Section 11.5 shall be payable by the Borrower as Administrative Expenses in accordance with the Priority of Payments and the terms of this Agreement.

 Each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, fees and other amounts due with respect to any Loans held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, fees and other amounts due with respect to the Loans held by such other Lender, the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts with respect to the Loans held by the Lenders shall be shared by the Lenders pro rata provided that nothing in this Section 12.4 shall impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of Indebtedness of the Borrower other than its Indebtedness under the Loans. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, by separate agreement with the Borrower, waive its right to set off contained herein or granted by law and any such written waiver shall be effective against such Lender under this Section 12.4. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 12.4, a pro rata allocation will mean an allocation of the amount received by such set-off or counterclaim and other rights as if such amount had been applied as a prepayment of the Loans under Section 2.7.

An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loans or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) and proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Subject to early termination due to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Default or as otherwise provided below in this Article XVI, the Borrower hereby designates ASIF, and ASIF hereby agrees to serve, as Servicer until the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Servicer is not the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Custodian or any Lender. 
 
 Section 16. 2 Resignation and Removal of the Servicer Appointment of Successor Servicer . (a) If a Servicer Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent , acting at the direction of the Controlling Parties, by written notice given to the Servicer (with a copy to the Collateral Agent), may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer and appoint a successor pursuant to the terms hereof.

 (b) The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Agreement as Servicer, unless the effectiveness of any material change in Applicable Law renders the performance by the Servicer of its duties hereunder to be a violation of such Applicable Law as evidenced by an opinion of counsel rendered for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. 
 
 (c) Any Person (i) into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, (iii) acquiring by conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all of the assets of the Servicer, or (iv) succeeding to the business of the Servicer in any of the foregoing cases, shall execute an agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the Servicer under this Agreement and, whether or not such assumption agreement is executed, shall be the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties to this Agreement, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (except Section 16.2(c)) and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law without causing the Servicer to have liability, the termination of the Servicer shall not become effective until an entity acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer. 
 
 (e) At any time, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may irrevocably waive any rights granted to such party under Section 16.2(a).
