 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 

Critical accounting policies 

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on a quarterly basis. The allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio. When estimating the net amount expected to be collected, management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the collectability of the Company s financial assets. Those estimates may be susceptible to significant change. Credit losses are charged directly against the allowance when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries from previously charged-off loans are added to the allowance when received. 
 
 The methodology to analyze the adequacy of the ACL is based on seven primary components: 
 
 Data: The quality of the Company s data is critically important as a foundation on which the ACL estimate is generated. For its estimate, the Company uses both internal and external data with a preference toward internal data where possible. Data is complete, accurate, and relevant, and subjected to appropriate governance and controls. 
 
 Segmentation: Financial assets are segmented based on similar risk characteristics. 
 
 Estimated term of financial assets: The estimated term of financial assets is a significant driver of ACL estimates. Financial assets or pools of financial assets with shorter estimated maturities typically result in a lower reserve than those with longer estimated maturities. As the average life of a financial asset or pool of assets increases, there generally is a corresponding increase to the ACL estimate because the likelihood of default is considered over a longer time frame. As such, pool-based assumptions for a pool s estimated term (i.e., average life) are based on the contractual maturity of the financial assets within the pool and adjusted in accordance with GAAP, if appropriate. Key assumptions for the estimated term of financial assets are prepayment rates for amortizing financial assets and curtailment rates for non-amortizing financial assets. 
 
 Credit loss measurement method: Multiple measurement methods for estimating ACLs are allowable per ASC Topic 326. The Company applies different estimation methods to different groups of financial assets. The discounted cash flow method is used for the Commercial Industrial, Commercial Real Estate Non-Owner Occupied, Commercial Real Estate Owner Occupied, Commercial Construction, Home Equity Installment Loan, Home Equity Line of Credit, Residential Real Estate, and Residential Construction pools. The weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) method is used for the Municipal, Non-Recourse Auto, Recourse Auto, Direct Finance Lease, and Consumer Other pools. 
 
 Reasonable and supportable forecasts: ASC Topic 326 requires Management to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect expected collectability of financial assets. As such, the Company s forecasts incorporate anticipated changes in the economic environment that may affect credit loss estimates over a time horizon when Management can reasonably support and document expectations. Forward-looking information may reflect positive or negative expectations relative to the current environment. As of the reporting date, management is using the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Unemployment Rate forecasts as well as the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI) for its reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company currently uses a 12 month 4 quarter) reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 
 Reversion period: ASC Topic 326 does not require management to estimate a reasonable and supportable forecast for the entire estimated life of financial assets. Management may apply reversion techniques for the estimated life remaining after considering the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which allows Management to apply a historical loss rate to latter periods of the financial asset s life. The Company currently uses a 12 month 4 quarter) straight-line reversion period. 
 Qualitative factor adjustments: The Company s ACL estimate considers all significant factors relevant to the expected collectability of its financial assets as of the reporting date; Qualitative factors reflect the impact of conditions not captured elsewhere, such as the historical loss data or within the economic forecast. The qualitative considerations can be captured directly within measurement models or as additional components in the overall ACL methodologies. Currently, the Company uses the following qualitative factors: 

o levels of and trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans; 
 o levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 
 o trends in volume and terms of loans; 
 o changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; 
 o changes in lending policies and legal and regulatory requirements; 
 o experience, ability and depth of lending management; 
 o national and local economic trends and conditions; 
 o changes in credit concentrations; and 
 o changes in underlying collateral. 

Assets are evaluated on a collective (or pool) basis or individually, as applicable consistent with ASC Topic 326. In accordance with ASC Topic 326, the Company will evaluate individual instruments for expected credit losses when those instruments do not share similar risk characteristics with instruments evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. In contrast to legacy accounting standards, this criterion is broader than the impairment concept as management may evaluate assets individually even when no specific expectation of collectability is in place. Instruments will not be included in both collective and individual analysis. Individual analysis will establish a specific reserve for instruments in scope. 
 
 For individually evaluated assets, an ACL is determined separately for each financial asset. As of the reporting date, the Company is using the collateral and cash flow methods. 
 
 ASC Topic 326 defines a collateral-dependent asset as a financial asset for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower, based on Management s assessment, is experiencing financial difficulty. The ACL for a collateral-dependent loan is measured using the fair value of collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is probable. The fair value of collateral must be adjusted for estimated costs to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the asset depends on the sale of the collateral. If repayment is dependent only on the operation of the collateral, and not on the sale of the collateral, the fair value of the collateral would not be adjusted for estimated costs to sell. If the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for costs to sell if applicable, is less than the amortized cost basis of the collateral-dependent asset, the difference is recorded as an ACL. 
 
 The Company s policy is to charge-off unsecured consumer loans when they become 90 days or more past due as to principal and interest. In the other portfolio segments, amounts are charged-off at the point in time when the Company deems the balance, or a portion thereof, to be uncollectible. 

If the individually evaluated asset is determined to not be collateral dependent, the ACL is measured based on the expected cash flows. This measurement is based on the amount and timing of cash flows; the effective interest rate (EIR) is used to discount the cash flows; and the basis for the determination of cash flows, including consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. These cash flows are discounted back by the EIR and compared to the amortized cost basis of the asset. If the present value of cash flows is less than the amortized cost, an ACL is recorded. When the present value of cash flows is equal to or greater than the amortized cost, no ACL is recorded. 
 
 An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies.

There was a
 million increase to the carrying value of municipal AFS securities resulting from the interest rate swap that was
 not included in the maturity table above.

Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers and borrowers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalty. Agency GSE and municipal securities are included based on their original stated maturity. MBS GSE residential, which are based on weighted-average lives and subject to monthly principal pay-downs, are listed in total. Most of the securities have fixed rates or have predetermined scheduled rate changes and many have call features that allow the issuer to call the security at par before its stated maturity without penalty. 

Securities pledged at September 30, 2024 had a carrying amount of million and were pledged to secure public deposits, trust client deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. 
 
 The following table presents the fair value and gross unrealized losses of debt securities aggregated by investment type, the length of time and the number of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

There were million and million increases to the carrying value of AFS securities resulting from the interest rate swap that increased the unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that were not included in the table above. 

The Company had debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 , including agency-GSE securities, MBS GSE residential securities and municipal securities. The severity of these unrealized losses based on their underlying cost basis was as follows at September 30, 2024 : for agency - GSE, for total MBS-GSE residential; and for municipals. Management has no intent to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company reassessed classification of certain investments and effective April 1, 2022, the Company transferred agency and municipal investment securities with a book value of million from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The securities were transferred at their fair value. The market value of the securities on the date of the transfer was million, after netting unrealized losses totaling million. The million, net of deferred taxes, is being accreted into interest income from other comprehensive income over the life of the bonds. The allowance for credit losses on these securities was evaluated under the accounting policy for HTM debt securities. 
 
 Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities have not been recognized into income because management believes the cause of the unrealized losses is related to changes in interest rates and is not directly related to credit quality. Quarterly, management conducts a formal review of investment securities to assess whether the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost as of the balance sheet date. An allowance for credit losses has not been recognized on these securities in an unrealized loss position because: 1 the entity does not intend to sell the security; 2 more likely than not the entity will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or 3 the present value of expected cash flows is sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost. The issuer(s) continues to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity. 
 
 The Company has U.S. agency bonds and municipal securities classified as held-to-maturity. Management estimated no credit loss reserve will be necessary for agency bonds HTM given the strong credit history of GSE and other U.S. agency issued bonds and the involvement of the U.S. government. For municipal securities HTM, the Company utilized a third -party model to analyze whether a credit loss reserve is needed for these bonds. The amount of credit loss reserve calculated using this model was immaterial to the Company's financial statements, therefore no reserve was recorded, but the Company will continue to evaluate these securities on a quarterly basis.

The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans disclosed throughout this footnote. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable for loans totaled million and million, respectively, and is included in the accrued interest receivable line in the consolidated balance sheets and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 
 
 Direct finance leases include the lease receivable and the guaranteed lease residual. Unearned lease revenue represents the difference between the lessor s investment in the property and the gross investment in the lease. Unearned revenue is accrued over the life of the lease using the effective interest method. 
 
 The Company services real estate loans for investors in the secondary mortgage market which are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The approximate unpaid principal balance of mortgages serviced for others amounted to million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. Mortgage servicing rights amounted to million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reviewed its commercial real estate loan portfolios to ensure the loans in those portfolios reflect proper purpose and collateral. Based on this analysis, loans with a net balance of million were reclassified from commercial real estate owner-occupied to commercial real estate non-owner-occupied categories. This adjustment was applied to December 31, 2023, for purposes of comparison. As of December 31, 2023, the non-owner-occupied portfolio increased and the owner-occupied portfolio decreased by million. 

Non-accrual loans

The decision to place loans on non-accrual status is made on an individual basis after considering factors pertaining to each specific loan. C I and CRE loans are placed on non-accrual status when management has determined that payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt or the loan is past due 90 days or more as to principal and interest, unless well-secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans secured by real estate and residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due as to principal and interest and unsecured consumer loans are charged-off when the loan is 90 days or more past due as to principal and interest. The Company considers all non-accrual loans to be impaired loans. 
 
 Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
 
 Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing interest rates below the market rate, temporary interest-only payment periods, term extensions at interest rates lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk and/or converting revolving credit lines to term loans. The Company typically does not forgive principal when modifying loans. 
 
 In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as lowering the interest rate, may be granted. For the loans included in the "combination" columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. 

The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, by class and type of modification. The percentage of the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as compared to the amortized cost basis of each class of financing receivable is also presented below:

The following table provides the amortized cost basis of financing receivables that had a payment default during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty: 

Total 

There were financing receivables that had a payment default during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 

Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. The allowance for credit losses (ACL)
 may be increased, adjustments
 may be made in the allocation of the ACL or partial charge-offs
 may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan.

Past due loans 
 
 Loans are considered past due when the contractual principal and/or interest is not received by the due date. For loans reported 30 - 59 days past due, certain categories of loans are reported past due as and when the loan is in arrears for two payments or billing cycles.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 Management is responsible for conducting the Company s credit risk evaluation process, which includes credit risk grading of individual commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans are assigned credit risk grades based on the Company s assessment of conditions that affect the borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. That process includes reviewing borrowers current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each individual borrower. Upon review, the commercial loan credit risk grade is revised or reaffirmed. The credit risk grades may be changed at any time management feels an upgrade or downgrade may be warranted. The Company utilizes an external independent loan review firm that reviews and validates the credit risk program on at least an annual basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the Board of Directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 
 
 Commercial and industrial and commercial real estate 
 
 The Company utilizes a loan grading system and assigns a credit risk grade to its loans in the C I and CRE portfolios. The grading system provides a means to measure portfolio quality and aids in the monitoring of the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The credit risk grades are arrived at using a risk rating matrix to assign a grade to each of the loans in the C I and CRE portfolios. 

These loans are assigned credit risk grades based on the Company s assessment of conditions that affect the borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. That process includes reviewing borrowers current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and other information specific to each individual borrower. Upon review, the commercial loan credit risk grade is revised or reaffirmed. The credit risk grades may be changed at any time management feels an upgrade or downgrade is warranted. 
 
 The following is a description of each risk rating category the Company uses to classify each of its C I and CRE loans: 
 
 Pass 
 
 Loans in this category have an acceptable level of risk and are graded in a range of one to five. Secured loans generally have good collateral coverage. Current financial statements reflect acceptable balance sheet ratios, sales and earnings trends. Management is competent, and a reasonable succession plan is evident. Payment experience on the loans has been good with minor or no delinquency experience. Loans with a grade of one are of the highest quality in the range. Those graded five are of marginally acceptable quality. 
 
 Special Mention 
 
 Loans in this category are graded a six and may be protected but are potentially weak. They constitute a credit risk to the Company but have not yet reached the point of adverse classification. Some of the following conditions may exist: little or no collateral coverage; lack of current financial information; delinquency problems; highly leveraged; available financial information reflects poor balance sheet ratios and profit and loss statements reflect uncertain trends; and document exceptions. Cash flow may not be sufficient to support total debt service requirements. 
 
 Substandard 
 
 Loans in this category are graded a seven and have a well-defined weakness which may jeopardize the ultimate collectability of the debt. The collateral pledged may be lacking in quality or quantity. Financial statements may indicate insufficient cash flow to service the debt; and/or do not reflect a sound net worth. The payment history indicates chronic delinquency problems. Management is weak. There is a distinct possibility that the Company may sustain a loss. All loans on non-accrual are rated substandard. Other loans that are included in the substandard category can be accruing, as well as loans that are current or past due. Loans 90 days or more past due, unless otherwise fully supported, are classified substandard. Also, borrowers that are bankrupt or have loans categorized as modifications experiencing financial difficulty can be graded substandard. 
 
 Doubtful 
 
 Loans in this category are graded an eight and have a better than 50 possibility of the Company sustaining a loss, but the loss cannot be determined because of specific reasonable factors which may strengthen credit in the near-term. Many of the weaknesses present in a substandard loan exist. Liquidation of collateral, if any, is likely. Any loan graded lower than an eight is considered to be uncollectible and charged-off. 
 
 Consumer and residential 
 
 The consumer and residential loan segments are regarded as homogeneous loan pools and as such are not risk rated. For these portfolios, the Company utilizes payment activity and history in assessing performance. Non-performing loans are comprised of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and accruing. All loans not classified as non-performing are considered performing. 

The following table presents loans including million and million of deferred costs, segregated by class and vintage, categorized into the appropriate credit quality indicator category as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively:

Collateral dependent loans 
 
 Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For loans that are individually evaluated and foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the financial asset is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the asset as of the measurement date. The following table presents the individually evaluated, collateral dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Allowance for credit losses 
 
 Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on a quarterly basis. The allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio. 
 
 Information related to the change in the allowance for credit losses on loans and the Company s recorded investment in loans by portfolio segment as of the period indicated is as follows:

Unfunded commitments 
 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 326, the Company estimates expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures over the contractual period during which the Company is exposed to credit risk. The estimate of expected credit losses takes into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur (i.e., funding rate) as well as the amount expected to be collected over the estimated remaining contractual term of the off-balance-sheet credit exposures (i.e., loss rate). The Company does not record an estimate of expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet exposures that are unconditionally cancellable. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 
 
 The Company's allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is recognized as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets, with adjustments to the reserve recognized in the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments on the consolidated statements of income. The Company's activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments for the period was as follows:

Direct finance leases 
 
 The Company originates direct finance leases through three automobile dealerships. The amortized cost of the Company s lease receivables, net of unearned income, was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The residual value of the direct finance leases is fully guaranteed by the dealerships. Residual values amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and are included in the amortized cost of direct finance leases. As of September 30, 2024, there was also thousand in deferred lease expense included in the carrying value of direct finance leases that is not included in the table below. 
 
 The undiscounted cash flows to be received on an annual basis for the direct finance leases are as follows:

and potentially dilutive shares related to issued and unexercised SSARs compared to and for the same 2023 periods, respectively. The calculation did not include weighted average unexercised SSARs that could potentially dilute earnings per share but their effect was antidilutive as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . For restricted stock, dilution would occur from the Company s previously granted but unvested shares. There were and potentially dilutive shares related to unvested restricted share grants as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to and for the same 2023 periods, respectively. 
 
 In the computation of diluted EPS, the Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of its granted but unexercised SSARs and unvested restricted stock. Under the treasury stock method, the assumed proceeds, as defined, received from shares issued in a hypothetical stock option exercise or restricted stock grant, are assumed to be used to purchase treasury stock. Proceeds include amounts received from the exercise of outstanding stock options and compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized in earnings. The Company does not consider awards from share-based grants in the computation of basic EPS. 
 
 The following table illustrates the data used in computing basic and diluted EPS for the periods indicated:

shares of its -par common stock for future issuance. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the requisite service or vesting period. Since 2019, the Company has approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) each year that awarded restricted stock and/or stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) to senior officers and managers based on the attainment of performance goals. The SSAR awards have a ten -year term from the date of each grant. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company approved a LTIP and awarded restricted stock to senior officers and managers in February 2024 based on 2023 performance. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company approved a LTIP and awarded restricted stock to senior officers and managers in February 2023 based on 2022 performance. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company awarded shares of restricted stock to one new employee. 

The following table summarizes the weighted-average fair value and vesting of restricted stock grants awarded during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 under the 2022 stock incentive plan:

 In addition to the 2022 stock incentive plan, the Company established the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) and reserved shares of its un-issued capital stock for issuance under the plan. The ESPP was designed to promote broad-based employee ownership of the Company s stock and to motivate employees to improve job performance and enhance the financial results of the Company. Under the ESPP, participation is voluntary whereby employees use automatic payroll withholdings to purchase the Company s capital stock at a discounted price based on the fair market value of the capital stock as measured on either the commencement or termination dates, as defined. As of September 30, 2024 , shar es have been issued under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered a compensatory plan and is required to comply with the provisions of current accounting guidance. The Company recognizes compensation expense on its ESPP on the date the shares are purchased, and it is included as a component of salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income.

The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, as listed below, approximates their fair value. These instruments generally have limited credit exposure, no stated or short-term maturities, carry interest rates that approximate market and generally are recorded at amounts that are payable on demand: 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents; 
 Non-interest bearing deposit accounts; 
 Savings, interest-bearing checking and money market accounts 
 Short-term borrowings and 
 Accrued interest. 

Securities: Fair values on investment securities are determined by prices provided by a third -party vendor, who is a provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. 
 
 Accruing loans and leases: The fair value of accruing loans is estimated by calculating the net present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at current offering rates for similar loans. Current offering rates consider, among other things, credit risk. 
 
 The carrying value that fair value is compared to is net of the allowance for credit losses and since there is significant judgment included in evaluating credit quality, loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Non-accrual loans: Loans which the Company has measured as non-accruing are generally based on the fair value of the loan s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third -party appraisals of the properties. These loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value consists of loan balances less the valuation allowance. 
 
 Loans held-for-sale: The fair value of loans held-for-sale is estimated using rates currently offered for similar loans and is typically obtained from the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) or the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB). 
 
 Interest rate swaps: Fair values on derivative instruments are determined by valuations provided by a third -party vendor, who is a provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. 
 
 Time deposits: The fair value of time deposits is based on discounted cash flows using rates which approximate market rates for deposits of similar maturities. 
 
 Secured borrowings: The fair value for these obligations uses an income approach based on expected cash flows on a pooled basis.

Debt securities in the AFS portfolio are measured at fair value using market quotations provided by a third -party vendor, who is a provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. Assets classified as Level 2 use valuation techniques that are common to bond valuations. That is, in active markets whereby bonds of similar characteristics frequently trade, quotes for similar assets are obtained. 
 
 There were changes in Level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of and for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 From time-to-time, the Company may be required to record at fair value financial instruments on a non-recurring basis, such as individually evaluated loans, ORE and other repossessed assets. These non-recurring fair value adjustments involve the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting on write downs of individual assets. The following table illustrates the financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis segregated by hierarchy fair value levels as of the periods indicated: 

Other repossessed assets Fair value of asset less selling costs

The following describes valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Individually evaluated loans that are collateral dependent are written down to fair value through the establishment of specific reserves, a component of the allowance for credit losses, and as such are carried at the lower of net recorded investment or the estimated fair value. Estimates of fair value of the collateral are determined based on a variety of information, including available valuations from certified appraisers for similar assets, present value of discounted cash flows and inputs that are estimated based on commonly used and generally accepted industry liquidation advance rates and estimates and assumptions developed by management. 

Valuation techniques for individually evaluated, collateral dependent loans are typically determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral or may be determined through present value of discounted cash flows. Both techniques include various Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable. The valuation technique may be adjusted by management for estimated liquidation expenses and qualitative factors such as economic conditions. If real estate is not the primary source of repayment, present value of discounted cash flows and estimates using generally accepted industry liquidation advance rates and other factors may be utilized to determine fair value. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the range of liquidation expenses and other valuation adjustments applied to individually evaluated, collateral dependent loans ranged from - to - and from - to - , respectively. The weighted average of liquidation expenses and other valuation adjustments applied to individually evaluated, collateral dependent loans amounted to - as of September 30, 2024 and - as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Due to the multitude of assumptions, many of which are subjective in nature, and the varying inputs and techniques used to determine fair value, the Company recognizes that valuations could differ across a wide spectrum of techniques employed. Accordingly, fair value estimates for individually evaluated, collateral dependent loans are classified as Level 3. 
 
 For ORE, fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying properties which generally include various Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable. Appraisals form the basis for determining the net realizable value from these properties. Net realizable value is the result of the appraised value less certain costs or discounts associated with liquidation which occurs in the normal course of business. Management s assumptions may include consideration of the location and occupancy of the property, along with current economic conditions. Subsequently, as these properties are actively marketed, the estimated fair values may be periodically adjusted through incremental subsequent write-downs. These write-downs usually reflect decreases in estimated values resulting from sales price observations as well as changing economic and market conditions. At December 31, 2023, the discounts applied to the appraised values of ORE ranged from - to - , and the weighted average of discount to the appraisal values of ORE amounted to - . At September 30, 2024, the net realizable values of properties in ORE were higher than the carrying value. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there was one other repossessed asset totaling thousand. At December 31, 2023, there were other repossessed assets. The Company refers to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guide to determine a vehicle s fair value. 

million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is reflected as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company has recorded income of million and million, respectively, due to an increase in cash surrender values. 
 
 Officer Life Insurance 
 
 The Bank enters into separate split dollar life insurance arrangements (Split Dollar Agreements) with certain officers which provide each officer a specified death benefit should the officer die while in the Bank s employ. The Bank owns the policies and all cash values thereunder. Upon death of the covered employee, the agreed-upon amount of death proceeds from the policies will be paid directly to the insured s beneficiary. As of September 30, 2024 , the policies had total death benefits of million of which million would be paid to the officer s beneficiaries and the remaining million would be paid to the Bank. In addition, executive officers have the opportunity to retain a split dollar benefit equal to two times their highest base salary after separation from service if the vesting requirements are met. In June 2024, the Bank entered into an agreement with one officer pursuant to which the Bank will share a portion of the net death proceeds of certain bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies with the participant s beneficiary should they die while employed by the Bank. Net death proceeds are the total death proceeds from the BOLI policies less the greater of the cash surrender value or aggregate premiums paid. Under the Split Dollar Agreement, the participant's beneficiary will receive a death benefit equal to the lesser of three times the participant's base salary at the date of death or the net death proceeds from the BOLI policies. See exhibit 10.15 for further information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had a balance in accrued expenses of thousand and thousand, respectively, for the split dollar benefit. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement plan (SERP) 
 
 On March 29, 2017, the Bank entered into separate supplemental executive retirement agreements (individually the SERP Agreement with officers, pursuant to which the Bank will credit an amount to a SERP account established on each participant s behalf while they are actively employed by the Bank for each calendar month from March 1, 2017 until retirement. On March 20, 2019, the Bank entered into a SERP Agreement with officer, pursuant to which the Bank will credit an amount to a SERP account established for the participant s behalf while they are actively employed by the Bank for each calendar month from March 1, 2019 until normal retirement age. As a result of the acquisition of Landmark, the Company acquired a SERP agreement with former employee. In June 2024, the bank entered into a supplemental executive retirement plan agreement (the SERP Agreement with one officer; pursuant to which the Bank will credit an amount to a SERP account established for the participant s behalf while they are actively employed by the Bank for each calendar month from June 1, 2024 until normal retirement age of 70. See exhibit 10.14 for further information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had a balance in accrued expenses of million and million in connection with these SERPs.

Interest rate derivative - fair value hedge designation 
 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. This interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge and limits the risk to the investment portfolio of rising interest rates. The Company entered into an interest rate swap with a third -party financial institution to convert fixed rate investment securities to an adjustable rate to produce a more asset sensitive profile. The Company recorded the fair value of the fair value hedge in other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The hedged items (fixed rate securities available-for-sale) are also recorded at fair value which offsets the adjustment to the fair value hedge. The related gains and losses are reported in interest income investment securities - U.S. government agencies and corporations and interest income investment securities - state and political subdivisions (nontaxable) in the consolidated statements of income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there was thousand in interest income investment securities - U.S. government agencies and corporations and thousand in interest income investment securities - state and political subdivisions (nontaxable). A qualitative assessment of hedge effectiveness was applied at inception of the hedge. Future hedge effectiveness will be determined on a qualitative basis at least annually. The hedge is expected to remain effective as long as the balance of the hedged item is projected to remain at or above the notional amount of the swap. 

The Company had investment securities with a book value of million pledged as collateral on its interest rate swaps with a third -party financial institution as of September 30, 2024 .

We are impacted by national, regional and market area economic factors, with commercial, commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans concentrated in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, and Eastern Pennsylvania, Northampton county. In the third quarter of 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased interest rates by 50 basis points. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate for September 2024 was 4.1 , up 0.4 percentage points from December 2023. However, the unemployment rates in the Scranton - Wilkes-Barre Hazleton (market area north) and the Allentown Bethlehem Easton (market area south) Metropolitan Statistical Areas (local) decreased as the national unemployment increased. The local unemployment rates at September 30, 2024 were 3.4 in market area north and 3.1 in market area south, respectively, a decrease of 0.1 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point from the 3.5 and 3.2 , respectively, at December 31, 2023. The median home values in the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre-Hazleton metro and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metro each increased 7.0 and 5.8 from a year ago, according to Zillow, an online database advertising firm providing access to its real estate search engines to various media outlets, and values are expected to grow 1.0 and 2.0 in the next year. In light of these expectations, we believe the real estate values could continue to increase at these levels with the declining rate environment. Management will continue to monitor the economic climate in our region and scrutinize growth prospects with credit quality as a principal consideration. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 15.0 million, or 2.59 diluted earnings per share, compared to 17.7 million, or 3.11 diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, tangible common book value per share (non-GAAP) was 32.55 and 25.37, respectively. See reconciliation on page 37. The increase in tangible book value was due primarily to an increase in retained earnings from net income and the increase in unrealized loss in AFS securities. These non-GAAP measures should be reviewed in connection with the reconciliation of these non-GAAP ratios. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures located below within this management s discussion and analysis. 
 
 Branch managers, relationship bankers, mortgage originators and our business service partners are all focused on developing a mutually profitable full banking relationship with our clients. We understand our markets, offer products and services along with financial advice that is appropriate for our community, clients and prospects. The Company continues to focus on the trusted financial advisor model by utilizing the team approach of experienced bankers that are fully engaged and dedicated towards maintaining and growing profitable relationships. 
 
 In addition to the challenging economic environment in which we compete, the regulation and oversight of our business has changed significantly in recent years. As described more fully in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors below, as well as Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in the Supervisory and Regulation section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2023 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act (Dodd-Frank Act) continue to have a significant impact on us. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The following are non-GAAP financial measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the consolidated financial statements but should be supplemental to GAAP used to prepare the Company s financial statements and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for GAAP measures. In addition, the Company s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures of other companies. The Company s tax rate used to calculate the fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) adjustment was 21 at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

General 
 
 The Company s earnings depend primarily on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income is generated from yields earned on interest-earning assets, which consist principally of loans and investment securities. Interest expense is incurred from rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which consist of deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the Company s interest rate spread (the difference between the yields earned on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate spread is significantly impacted by: changes in interest rates and market yield curves and their related impact on cash flows; the composition and characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets compared to the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of the liabilities that fund them and by the competition in the marketplace. 
 
 The Company s earnings are also affected by the level of its non-interest income and expenses and by the provisions for credit losses and income taxes. Non-interest income mainly consists of: service charges on the Company s loan and deposit products; interchange fees; trust and asset management service fees; increases in the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance and from net gains or losses from sales of loans and securities. Non-interest expense consists of: compensation and related employee benefit costs; occupancy; equipment; data processing; advertising and marketing; FDIC insurance premiums; professional fees; loan collection; net other real estate owned (ORE) expenses; supplies and other operating overhead. 
 
 Net interest income, net interest rate margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in the Management's Discussion Analysis on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. 
 
 Comparison of the results of operations 
 three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million, or 0.86 diluted earnings per share, compared to 5.3 million, or 0.93 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 0.3 million decline in net income resulted primarily from the 1.0 million increase in non-interest expenses coupled with a 0.4 million increase in the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments and 0.2 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans. This was partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in net interest income and a 0.7 million increase in non-interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 15.0 million, or 2.59 diluted earnings per share, compared to 17.7 million, or 3.11 diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.7 million, or 15 , decline in net income stemmed from the 2.0 million higher non-interest expenses and 1.6 million reduction in net interest income partially offset by the increase of 0.8 million in non-interest income.

Return on average assets (ROA) was 0.79 and 0.88 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.81 and 0.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the same time periods, return on average shareholders equity (ROE) was 9.89 and 11.96 , respectively, and 10.34 and 13.64 , respectively. The decreases in ROA and ROE were primarily the result of the decline in net income as average assets and equity increased during the third quarter of 2024 and year-to-date 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. Pre-provision net revenue to average assets (non-GAAP) was 1.05 and 1.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.00 and 1.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase quarter-over-quarter was due to an increase in pre-provision net revenue in the third quarter of 2024. The year-over-year decrease is due to a decline in income before taxes. 
 
 Net interest income and interest sensitive assets / liabilities 
 
 Net interest income was 15.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 5 increase over the 14.6 million earned for the third quarter of 2023. The 0.8 million increase in net interest income resulted from the increase of 3.6 million in interest income primarily due to a 71.0 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets and a 50 basis point increase in fully-taxable equivalent ("FTE") yield. The loan portfolio had the biggest impact, producing a 3.7 million increase in FTE interest income from 122.8 million in higher quarterly average balances and an increase of 49 basis points in FTE loan yield. Slightly offsetting the higher interest income, a 2.8 million increase in interest expense was due to a 55 basis point increase in the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits coupled with a 94.4 million quarter-over-quarter increase in average deposit balances. 
 
 Net interest income was 45.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.6 million, or 3 , decrease was the result of interest expense growing faster than interest income. On the asset side, the loan portfolio caused interest income growth by producing 9.5 million more in interest income primarily from an increase of 47 basis points in FTE loan yields on 97.4 million in higher average balances. On the funding side, total interest expense increased by 11.6 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense paid on deposits of 12.0 million from an 86 basis point higher rate paid on a 97.1 million larger average balance of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.70 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 53 basis points from the 2.17 for the third quarter of 2023. The cost of funds increased 45 basis points to 2.08 for the third quarter of 2024 from 1.63 for the third quarter of 2023. The FTE yield on interest-earning assets was 4.68 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 50 basis points from the 4.18 for the third quarter of 2023. The Company s FTE (non-GAAP measurement) net interest spread was 1.98 for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3 basis points from the 2.01 recorded for the third quarter of 2023. FTE net interest margin increased to 2.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.63 for the same 2023 period due to allocation of better performing interest earning assets, which led to a 7 basis point margin improvement. In the third quarter of 2024, management continued to re-invest cash flow into more effective interest earning assets, such as the commercial loan portfolio. As a result, the Company experienced an increase in FTE adjusted net interest income of 0.9 million from 15.3 million to 16.2 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 The overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cost of funds increased 66 basis points to 1.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.33 for the same period of 2023. The FTE yield on interest-earning assets was 4.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 47 basis points from the 4.12 for year-to-date September 30, 2023. The Company s FTE (non-GAAP measurement) net interest spread was 1.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 34 basis points from the 2.33 recorded for the same period of 2023. FTE net interest margin decreased by 16 basis points to 2.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.86 for the same 2023 period due to the increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities growing at a faster pace than the yields on interest-earning assets.

For the remainder of 2024 , the Company currently expects to operate in a moderately declining interest rate environment that is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2025. Management is primarily reliant on the Federal Open Market Committee's statements and forecast. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, the Company s net interest income performance has been reduced due to asset yields being outpaced by higher cost of funds, compressing net interest spread. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, the Company experienced an increase in net interest income due to redeployment of assets into more effective interest earning assets, partially offset by the continued increase in cost of funds. In September 2024, the FOMC decreased the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, which did not have much of an impact on improving net interest margin as of quarter end. In November 2024, the FOMC decreased the fed funds rate another 25 basis points. Consensus economic forecasts are expecting small declines between 25 to 50 basis points through the end of 2024, with at least another 100 basis points during 2025. The Company does not expect to see improvement in net interest margin in the immediate effect, as rates on interest bearing deposits will take time to match the decreasing rate environment. For the remainder of 2024 and into fiscal year 2025, the Company currently maintains a loan pipeline which is expected to grow the loan portfolio funded by utilizing excess cash holdings and will plan to borrow in the event cash is depleted and there is not enough deposit growth to fund loan growth. The focus remains to manage margin compression by restructuring the balance sheet, being proactive with loan pricing and managing deposit costs to maintain a reasonable spread. 
 
 The Company s cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.70 and 2.60 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.17 and 1.79 for the same 2023 periods. The increase in interest paid on deposits contributed to the higher cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The FOMC is expected to decrease the federal funds rate throughout the remainder of 2024, but the Company may continue to experience pressure to maintain higher rates on interest-bearing deposits due to the competitive nature of deposits in our market area. To help mitigate any impact of the imminent change to the economic landscape, the Company has successfully developed and will continue to strengthen its association with existing customers, develop new business relationships and generate new loan volumes.

The Company s Asset Liability Management (ALM) team meets regularly to discuss among other things, interest rate risk and when deemed necessary adjusts interest rates. ALM is actively addressing the Company's sensitivity to a changing rate environment to ensure interest rate risks are contained within acceptable levels. ALM also discusses revenue enhancing strategies to help combat the potential for a decline in net interest income. The Company s marketing department, together with ALM, and service-driven branch and relationship managers, continue to develop prudent strategies that will grow the loan portfolio and accumulate relationship driven deposits at costs lower than borrowing costs to improve net interest income performance. 
 
 The table that follows sets forth a comparison of average balances of assets and liabilities and their related net tax equivalent yields and rates for the periods indicated. Within the table, interest income was FTE adjusted, using the corporate federal tax rate of 21 for September 30, 2024 and 2023 to recognize the income from tax-exempt interest-earning assets as if the interest was taxable. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this management s discussion and analysis for the FTE adjustments. This treatment allows a uniform comparison among yields on interest-earning assets. Loans include loans held-for-sale (HFS) and non-accrual loans but exclude the allowance for credit losses. Home equity lines of credit (HELOC) are included in the residential real estate category since they are secured by real estate. Net deferred loan cost amortization of 0.2 million and 0.3 million during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.7 million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in interest income from loans. Merchants Bank of Bangor and Landmark Community Bank loan fair value purchase accounting adjustments of 0.3 million and 0.5 million are included in interest income from loans and 1 thousand and 7 thousand reduced interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Merchants Bank of Bangor and Landmark Community Bank loan fair value purchase accounting adjustments of 1.2 million and 2.0 million are included in interest income from loans and 6 thousand and 27 thousand reduced interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Average balances are based on amortized cost and do not reflect net unrealized gains or losses. Residual values for direct finance leases are included in the average balances for consumer loans.

Changes in net interest income are a function of both changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volumes of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (1) the changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior period rate), (2) the changes attributable to changes in interest rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior period volume) and (3) the net change. The combined effect of changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. Tax-exempt income was not converted to a tax-equivalent basis on the rate/volume analysis:

Provision for credit losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses represents the necessary amount to charge against current earnings, the purpose of which is to adjust the allowance for credit losses to a level that represents management s best estimate of expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio. Loans determined to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance. The required amount of the provision for credit losses, based upon the adequate level of the allowance, is subject to the ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio. The Company s Special Assets Committee meets periodically to review problem loans. The committee is comprised of management, including credit administration officers, loan officers, loan workout officers and collection personnel. 
 
 Management continuously reviews the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the amounts of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses is based on management s current judgments about the credit quality of the Company s financial assets and known and expected relevant internal and external factors that significantly affect collectability such as historical loss information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including significant qualitative factors.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans was 0.7 million and provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was 0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans increased 0.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to growth in the loan portfolio of 67.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to growth of 16.1 million in the same quarter of 2023, specifically in the commercial loan portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments increased 0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a higher growth in unfunded loan commitments, specifically commercial construction commitments. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans was 1.1 million and the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was 0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans decreased 0.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a reduction in net charge-offs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments increased 0.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a higher growth in unfunded loan commitments, specifically commercial construction commitments. 
 
 The provision for credit losses derives from the reserve required from the allowance for credit losses calculation. The Company continued provisioning for nine months ended September 30, 2024 to maintain an allowance level that management deemed adequate. 
 
 For a discussion on the allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for credit losses, located in the comparison of financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis contained herein. 
 
 Other income 
 
 Total non-interest income increased 0.7 million, or 15 , to 5.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to an additional 0.1 in million service charges on commercial loans, 0.1 million in higher fees from trust fiduciary activities, 0.1 million more in financial services revenue, and fees from commercial loans with interest rate hedges which increased 0.1 million. 
 
 Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.2 million, an increase of 0.8 million, or 7 , from 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 0.5 million in additional trust fiduciary fees and 0.2 million higher fees from financial services. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded a 0.1 million write-down associated with a branch closure reducing non-interest income. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company received 0.3 million in recoveries from acquired charged-off loans, offsetting the increase in other income. Additionally, the Company experienced a decrease of 0.2 million in fees from commercial loans with interest rate hedges compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 Non-interest expenses increased 1.0 million, or 8 , for the third quarter of 2024 to 13.8 million from 12.8 million for the same quarter of 2023. The increase in non-interest expenses was primarily due to 0.9 million higher salaries and benefits expense from higher salaries related to new hires and banker incentives. There were also increases in professional services of 0.1 million and PA shares tax of 0.1 million. 
 
 Non-interest expenses increased to 41.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 million, or 5 , from 39.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expenses was primarily due to the 2.0 million increase in salaries and benefits expense coupled with increases in professional fees of 0.3 million and PA shares tax of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were partially offset by 0.4 million less in fraud losses and 0.2 million less advertising and marketing expenses. 
 
 The ratios of non-interest expense less non-interest income to average assets, known as the expense ratio, were 1.46 and 1.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The expense ratio increased because of higher non-interest expenses. The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) increased from 62.33 at September 30, 2023 to 66.44 at September 30, 2024 due to non-interest expenses increasing as net interest income declined. For more information on the calculation of the efficiency ratio, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures located within this management s discussion and analysis. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes decreased 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate was 13.1 at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.9 at September 30, 2023. The difference between the effective rate and the enacted statutory corporate rate of 21 is due mostly to the effect of tax-exempt income in relation to the level of pre-tax income. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to less in tax credits during 2024.

Comparison of financial condition at 
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 The Company s total assets had a balance of 2.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 billion, from 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from 107.9 million in growth in the loans and leases portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents increased 8.2 million and the investment portfolio decreased by 8.5 million. The decline in the investment portfolio was primarily due to 16.7 million in paydowns partially offset by an 8.4 million increase in market value of available-for-sale securities. As of September 30, 2024, the market value of held-to-maturity securities also increased by 6.0 million compared to December 31, 2023, with 22.2 million in unrealized losses. During the same time period, total liabilities increased 95.0 million, or 4 . Deposit growth of 184.1 million was utilized to pay down 92.0 million in short-term borrowings and fund growth in the loan portfolio. 
 
 Funds Deployed: 
 
 Investment securities 
 
 At the time of purchase, management classifies investment securities into one of three categories: trading, available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity (HTM). To date, management has not purchased any securities for trading purposes. Some of the securities the Company purchases are classified as AFS even though there is no immediate intent to sell them. The AFS designation affords management the flexibility to sell securities and position the balance sheet in response to capital levels, liquidity needs or changes in market conditions. Debt securities AFS are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported separately within shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Securities designated as HTM are carried at amortized cost and represent debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, AOCI increased by 8.0 million primarily due to the change in fair value of the Company's investment securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of held-to-maturity securities was 225.4 million, net of 14.3 million in remaining transferred discount. 
 
 The Company utilized a fair value hedge to designate and swap a portion of the fixed rate AFS portfolio. The Company has an approved Derivative Policy that requires Board pre-approval on such balance sheet hedging activities as well as ongoing reporting to its ALCO Committee. The Board has approved up to 200 million in notional amount of pay-fixed interest rate swap and the Company has executed on 100 million to date. 
 
 During September 2023, the Company entered into a 100 million interest rate swap with a third-party financial institution to limit the risk to the investment portfolio of rising interest rates. The interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge and utilized a pay fixed interest rate swap to hedge the change in fair value attributable to the movement in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The Company designated 50 million of the swap's notional balance as a hedge against the closed portfolio of 20-year mortgage-backed securities and 50 million as a hedge against the closed portfolio of tax-free municipal bonds. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded the fair value of the swap of 2.3 million in accrued interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet offset by a 2.3 million increase to the carrying value of designated investment securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of investment securities amounted to 559.8 million, or 21 of total assets, compared to 568.3 million, or 23 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2024, 33 of the carrying value of the investment portfolio was comprised of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS GSE residential or mortgage-backed securities) that amortize and provide monthly cash flow that the Company can use for reinvestment, loan demand, unexpected deposit outflow, facility expansion or operations. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio includes only pass-through bonds issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). 
 
 The Company s municipal (obligations of states and political subdivisions) portfolio is comprised of tax-free municipal bonds with a carrying value of 189.2 million 168.5 million including the remaining net unrealized loss transferred on HTM securities) and taxable municipal bonds with a carrying value of 89.4 million 97.5 million including the remaining net unrealized loss transferred on HTM securities). The overall credit ratings of these municipal bonds were as follows: 37 AAA, 61 AA, and 1 A. For municipal securities HTM, the Company utilized a third-party model to analyze whether a credit loss reserve is needed for these bonds. The amount of the credit loss reserve calculated was immaterial because of the underlying strong credit quality of the municipal portfolio. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the carrying value of total investments decreased 8.5 million, or 1 . The decline was primarily due to principal reductions totaling 17.5 million, partially offset by an increase in the unrealized loss position of 8.4 million in the AFS portfolio. The Company attempts to maintain a well-diversified and proportionate investment portfolio that is structured to complement the strategic direction of the Company. Its growth typically supplements the lending activities but also considers the current and forecasted economic conditions, the Company s liquidity needs and interest rate risk profile, to the extent possible.

The investment securities portfolio contained no private label mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations, or trust preferred securities. The portfolio had no adjustable-rate instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Investment securities were comprised of AFS and HTM securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The AFS securities were recorded with a net unrealized loss of 43.2 million and a net unrealized loss of 51.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the 8.4 million net increase; 5.5 million was attributable to mortgage-backed securities, 2.0 million was attributable to municipal securities, and 1.0 million was attributable to agency securities. The direction and magnitude of the change in value of the Company s investment portfolio is attributable to the direction and magnitude of the change in interest rates along the treasury yield curve. Generally, the values of debt securities move in the opposite direction of the changes in interest rates. As interest rates along the treasury yield curve rise, especially at the intermediate and long end, the values of debt securities tend to decline. Whether or not the value of the Company s investment portfolio will change above or below its amortized cost will be largely dependent on the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements and the duration of the debt securities within the Company s investment portfolio. Management does not consider the reduction in value attributable to changes in credit quality. Correspondingly, when interest rates decline, the market values of the Company s debt securities portfolio could be subject to market value increases. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 294.5 million in public deposits, or 13 of total deposits. Pennsylvania state law requires the Company to maintain pledged securities on public and trust deposits or otherwise obtain a FHLB letter of credit or FDIC insurance for these customers. The Company also pledges securities for derivative instruments and certain borrowed funds. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of pledged securities required was 362.2 million, or 65 of total securities. 
 
 Quarterly, management performs a review of the investment portfolio to determine the causes of declines in the fair value of each security. The Company uses inputs provided by independent third parties to determine the fair value of its investment securities portfolio. Inputs provided by the third parties are reviewed and corroborated by management. Evaluations of the causes of the unrealized losses are performed to determine whether credit losses on debt securities exist. Considerations such as the Company s intent and ability to hold the securities until or sell prior to maturity, recoverability of the invested amounts over the intended holding period, the length of time and the severity in pricing decline below cost, the interest rate environment, the receipt of amounts contractually due and whether or not there is an active market for the securities, for example, are applied, along with an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer for management to make a realistic judgment of the probability that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts (principal and interest) due in determining whether a security has credit losses. If a decline in value is deemed to be a credit loss, a contra-asset is recorded on both HTM and AFS securities, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not incur any credit losses on debt securities from its investment securities portfolio. 
 
 During January 2023 with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declining, 31.2 million of securities were able to be sold yielding 3.62 (FTE yield of 4.33 at a breakeven level. These proceeds were used to pay down FHLB overnight borrowings costing 4.80 at that time. Due to volatility in the levels of borrowings during October 2023 and the increasing expected dependency on borrowing capacity from experiencing deposit fluctuations while funding loan growth, the Company evaluated a liquidity strategy to deleverage the reliance on short-term borrowings. As a result of this evaluation, in November 2023, the Company sold longer term available-for-sale general market tax-free municipal securities with a carrying value of 35.6 million with a weighted average yield of 1.28 with a 13.5 year weighted average maturity as part of a liquidity and net interest margin enhancement strategy for a 6.5 million loss recognized in gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale debt securities. The 29.1 million in proceeds received were used to retire short-term borrowings with a cost of approximately 5.50 . While the Company has ample funding sources available, management felt it prudent to create additional capacity for the borrowings over the near term should the banking industry again experience funding pressures as it did in March of 2023. In addition, since the municipal securities sold were purchased in a much lower rate environment, there is an immediate improvement in net interest margin (NIM) of over 5 bps as a result of paying down the borrowing with the sale proceeds. The sale removed a 422 basis point negative spread and will contribute towards incrementally improving net interest income, earnings per share and NIM every year starting in 2024. The cost savings from paying down the advances with the sale of low yielding bonds will also allow the pre-tax loss of 6.5 million realized on the sale to be fully recouped prior to the term of the bonds sold. 
 
 Restricted investments in bank stock 
 
 Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock is required for membership in the organization and is carried at cost since there is no market value available. The amount the Company is required to invest is dependent upon the relative size of outstanding borrowings the Company has with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Excess stock is repurchased from the Company at par if the amount of borrowings decline to a predetermined level. In addition, the Company earns a return or dividend based on the amount invested. Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB) stock totaled 82 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The balance in FHLB stock was 3.9 million and 3.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The dividends received from the FHLB totaled 227 thousand and 229 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Loans held-for-sale (HFS) 
 
 Upon origination, most residential mortgages and certain Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans may be classified as held-for-sale (HFS). In the event of market rate increases, fixed-rate loans and loans not immediately scheduled to re-price would no longer produce yields consistent with the current market. In declining interest rate environments, the Company would be exposed to prepayment risk as rates on fixed-rate loans decrease, and customers look to refinance loans. Consideration is given to the Company s current liquidity position and projected future liquidity needs. To better manage prepayment and interest rate risk, loans that meet these conditions may be classified as HFS. Occasionally, residential mortgage and/or business loans may be transferred from the loan portfolio to HFS. The carrying value of loans HFS is based on the lower of cost or estimated fair value. If the fair values of these loans decline below their original cost, the difference is written down and charged to current earnings. Subsequent appreciation in the portfolio is credited to current earnings but only to the extent of previous write-downs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans HFS consisted of residential mortgages with carrying amounts of 1.8 million and 1.5 million, respectively, which approximated their fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, residential mortgage loans with principal balances of 44.7 million were sold into the secondary market and the Company recognized net gains of 0.8 million, compared to 37.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company retains mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on loans sold into the secondary market. MSRs are retained so that the Company can foster relationships. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the servicing portfolio balance of sold residential mortgage loans was 490.9 million and 477.7 million, respectively, with mortgage servicing rights of 1.4 million and 1.5 million for the same periods, respectively. 
 
 Loans and leases 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had gross loans and leases totaling 1.8 billion, an increase of 108.6 million, or 6 , compared to 1.7 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the growth in the portfolio was primarily attributed to a 113.4 million increase in the commercial portfolio due to the origination of two commercial industrial l oans to two unrelated borrowers totaling 11 million; an origination to a single municipal borrower totaling 15 million; the origination of five commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans to five different borrowers to taling 39 million; the origination of two commercial real estate owner occupied loans to two different borrowers totaling 19 million; the origination of four commercial construction loans to three different borrowers totaling 10 million; and general portfolio growth. The Company also experienced a 18.1 million increase in the residential portfolio, the result of a higher percentage of adjustable-rate mortgages recorded as held-for-investment during this period. This growth was offset by the 22.9 million reduction in the consumer portfolio attributed to a strategic reduction in the auto portfolio. 
 
 As management continues to identify ways to optimize the Company s balance sheet, the focus is to lend in areas that provide better risk-adjusted returns and improved opportunities to deepen relationships with our customers. This could result in a change in the composition of the loan portfolio in future periods. 
 
 The composition of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is summarized as follows:

During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reviewed its commercial real estate loan portfolios to ensure the loans in those portfolios reflect proper purpose and collateral. Based on this analysis, loans with a net balance of 25.4 million were reclassified between commercial real estate owner-occupied and commercial real estate non-owner-occupied categories. This adjustment was applied to December 31, 2023, for purposes of comparison. As of December 31, 2023, the non-owner-occupied portfolio increased and the owner-occupied portfolio decreased by 26.1 million.

Commercial industrial (C I) and commercial real estate (CRE) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the commercial portfolio increased by 113 million, or 13 , to 1.0 billion compared to the December 31, 2023 balance of 0.9 billion. The increase was due to growth of 35 million in commercial and industrial loans and growth of 78 million in commercial real estate loans. 
 
 Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured with short-term assets; however, in many cases, additional collateral such as real estate is provided as additional security for the loan. Loan-to-value maximum values have been established by the Company and are specific to the type of collateral. Collateral values may be determined using invoices, inventory reports, accounts receivable aging reports, independent collateral appraisals, etc. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial and industrial (non-municipal) loans increased 16.0 million, or 10 , from 152.6 million at December 31, 2023 to 168.6 million at September 30, 2024, which was due to the origination of two commercial industrial lo ans to two unrelated borrowers totaling 11 million along with originations and advances outpacing scheduled payments and curtailments. 
 
 Municipal loans are secured by the full faith and credit of respective local government units located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania authorized in accordance with the Local Government Unit Debt Act. These loans have a long history of performance within contractual terms with no defaults noted. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, municipal loans increased 18.6 million, or 20 , from 94.7 million on December 31, 2023, to 113.3 million at September 30, 2024 which was attributed to the origination of a Tax Anticipation Note to a single municipal borrower totaling 15 million and general portfolio growth. 
 
 Commercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than other types of loans due primarily to the effect of general economic conditions and the complexities involved in valuing the underlying collateral whose values tend to move inversely with interest rates. These loans are secured with mortgages, or commercial real estate mortgages (CREM) against the subject property. In underwriting commercial real estate construction loans, the Company performs a robust analysis of the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower s credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the project using feasibility studies, market data, etc. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are performed by independent appraisers consistent with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) standards and compliant with Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, owner occupied commercial real estate loans increased 17.9 million, or 6 , from 278.3 million on December 31, 2023, to 296.2 million at September 30, 2024, which was attributed to the origination of two commercial real estate owner occupied loans to two different borrowers totaling 19 million. 
 
 Owner occupied commercial real estate loans rely on income generated from the respective owners businesses. Therefore, underwriting on owner occupied CRE loans emphasizes the owner s cash flow and financial conditions while the real estate typically represents the owners' primary business location. Since cash flows from operations are the primary source of repayment for owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, this segment has a different risk profile than non-owner occupied lending. 
 
 The Company maintains a well-diversified non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio with no material concentration to any property type. The chart below describes the purpose for the types of exposure contained within the loan portfolio for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans at September 30, 2024:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans increased 44.4 million, or 13 , from 337.7 million on December 31, 2023, to 382.1 million on September 30, 2024. The largest contributor to the increase was five loans to unrelated borrowers originated totaling 39 million, all with loan-to-value limits within adherence of the Company's policy. 
 
 Non-owner occupied CRE loans are commercial loans not occupied by their owners and thus rely on income from third parties, including multi-family residential tenants and commercial tenants representing various industries. Underwriting on non-owner occupied CRE loans evaluates cash flow derived from the respective tenants and the industries they occupy. As such, management considers non-owner occupied CRE loans as having a higher risk profile than owner occupied CRE loans. In keeping with its risk appetite and relationship management strategy, the Company avoids speculative commercial office space and prefers loans for projects with the following characteristics: sufficient equity, or loan to value, and have either S P rated tenants with long term leases, loans structured with personal guarantees of owners whose personal financial strength provides meaningful cash flow support to supplement rental income volatility, residential projects with stable rents in desirable locations, or projects with sufficient diversity and industries proven to provide lower risk over the long term. 
 
 In the table above, office space comprised 52.2 million and special purpose comprised 29.2 million in potential exposure, respectively. The office segment mainly has suburban medical and suburban professional third-party tenants. The special purpose segment included self-storage facilities, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and parking garages.

Construction lending consists of commercial and residential site development loans, as well as commercial building construction and residential housing construction loans. Management prefers lending to well-established developers with a proven track record and strong business and guaranteed with owners personal financial conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the commercial construction portfolio of 56.3 million consisted of 46.9 million, or 83 , of non-owner-occupied loans and 9.4 million, or 17 , of owner-occupied loans. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial construction loans increased 16.5 million, or 41 , from 39.8 million on December 31, 2023 to 56.3 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was attributed to 14.1 million in commercial construction commitments originated during the year and 13.9 million in advances during the year on commercial construction loan availability booked prior to December 31, 2023. These advances were partially offset by 0.4 million of paydowns/payoffs and 11.1 million in projects that stabilized and were converted to owner and non-owner commercial real estate loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Consumer 
 
 The consumer loan portfolio consisted of home equity installment, home equity line of credit, non-recourse auto loans, recourse auto loans, direct finance leases and other consumer loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total consumer loan portfolio decreased by 22.9 million, or 8 , to 259.5 million compared to the December 31, 2023 balance of 282.4 million, primarily due to a management strategic determination to reduce the indirect auto portfolio totaling 28 million resulting from payoffs/paydowns with minimal originations. Offsetting the reduction in the indirect auto portfolio was growth of 5 million in the HELOC portfolio due to a sales campaign done during the year and growth of 7 million in the other consumer portfolio due to 6 million in personal loans purchased from Banker Healthcare Group (BHG) during the year along with general portfolio growth. For the remainder of 2024, the Company expects maturities of approximately 6.7 million in the dealer portfolio with minimal originations. 
 
 Residential 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the residential loan portfolio increased by 18.1 million, or 4 , to 519.6 million compared to the December 31, 2023 balance of 501.5 million. The increase was due to a shift from mortgage loans sold in the secondary market to loans held-for-investment, primarily jumbo mortgages with rates fixed for 5, 7 or 10 years with adjustable rates thereafter. 
 
 The residential loan portfolio consisted primarily of held-for-investment residential loans for primary residences, including approximately 393 million in fixed-rate and 97 million in adjustable-rate mortgages as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company considers its portfolio segmentation, including the real estate secured portfolio, to be reasonably diversified. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including, among other things, the effects of real estate values. The Company ensures that its mortgage lending adheres to standards of secondary market compliance. Furthermore, the Company s credit function strives to mitigate the negative impact of economic conditions by maintaining strict underwriting principles for all loan types. 
 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 
 Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on a quarterly basis. The allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. When estimating the net amount expected to be collected, management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the collectability of the Company s financial assets. Those estimates may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged directly against the allowance when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries from previously charged-off loans are added to the allowance when received. 
 
 The methodology to analyze the adequacy of the ACL is based on seven primary components: 

Data: The quality of the Company s data is critically important as a foundation on which the ACL estimate is generated. For its estimate, the Company uses both internal and external data with a preference toward internal data where possible. Data is complete, accurate, and relevant, and subjected to appropriate governance and controls. 

Segmentation: Financial assets are segmented based on similar risk characteristics. 

Estimated term of financial assets: The estimated term of financial assets is a significant driver of ACL estimates. Financial assets or pools of financial assets with shorter estimated maturities typically result in a lower reserve than those with longer estimated maturities. As the average life of a financial asset or pool of assets increases, there generally is a corresponding increase to the ACL estimate because the likelihood of default is considered over a longer time frame. As such, pool-based assumptions for a pool s estimated term (i.e., average life) are based on the contractual maturity of the financial assets within the pool and adjusted in accordance with GAAP, if appropriate. Key assumptions for the estimated term of financial assets are prepayment rates for amortizing financial assets and curtailment rates for non-amortizing financial assets. 

Credit loss measurement method: Multiple measurement methods for estimating ACLs are allowable per Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326. The Company applies different estimation methods to different groups of financial assets. The discounted cash flow method is used for the commercial industrial, commercial real estate non-owner occupied, commercial real estate owner occupied, commercial construction, home equity installment loan, home equity line of credit, residential real estate, and residential construction pools. The weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) method is used for the municipal, non-recourse auto, recourse auto, direct finance lease, and consumer other pools. 

Reasonable and supportable forecasts: ASC Topic 326 requires management to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect expected collectability of financial assets. As such, the Company s forecasts incorporate anticipated changes in the economic environment that may affect credit loss estimates over a time horizon when management can reasonably support and document expectations. Forward-looking information may reflect positive or negative expectations relative to the current environment. As of the reporting date, management is using the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate forecasts as well as the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI) for its reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company currently uses a 12-month (4 quarter) reasonable and supportable forecast period.

Table of Contents 

Reversion period: ASC Topic 326 does not require management to estimate a reasonable and supportable forecast for the entire contractual life of financial assets. Management may apply reversion techniques for the contractual life remaining after considering the reasonable and supportable forecast period, which allows management to apply a historical loss rate to latter periods of the financial asset s life. The Company currently uses a 12 month (4 quarter) straight-line reversion period. 

Qualitative factor adjustments: The Company s ACL estimate considers all significant factors relevant to the expected collectability of its financial assets as of the reporting date; Qualitative factors reflect the impact of conditions not captured elsewhere, such as the historical loss data or within the economic forecast. The qualitative considerations can be captured directly within measurement models or as additional components in the overall ACL methodologies. Currently, the Company uses the following qualitative factors: 

o 
 levels of and trends in delinquencies and non-accrual loans; 

o 
 levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 

o 
 trends in volume and terms of loans; 

o 
 changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; 

o 
 changes in lending policies and legal and regulatory requirements; 

o 
 experience, ability and depth of lending management; 

o 
 national and local economic trends and conditions; 

o 
 changes in credit concentrations; and 

o 
 changes in underlying collateral. 

A control related to the allowance is the Company s Special Assets Committee. This committee meets quarterly, and the applicable lenders discuss each relationship under review and reach a consensus on the appropriate estimated loss amount, if applicable, based on current accounting guidance. The Special Assets Committee s focus is on ensuring the pertinent facts are considered regarding not only loans considered for specific reserves, but also the collectability of loans that may be past due in payment. The assessment process also includes the review of all loans on a non-accruing basis as well as a review of certain loans to which the lenders or the Company s Credit Administration function have assigned a criticized or classified risk rating.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance increased 0.8 million, or 4 , to 19.6 million from 18.8 million on December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance was based on the provisioning of 1.1 million partially offset by net charge-offs of 0.3 million.

Management believes that the current balance in the allowance for credit losses is sufficient to meet the identified potential credit quality issues that may arise and other issues unidentified but inherent to the portfolio. Potential problem loans are those where there is known information that leads management to believe repayment of principal and/or interest is in jeopardy and the loans are currently neither on non-accrual status nor past due 90 days or more.

Table of Contents 

Key loss driver assumptions used in the allowance estimate included the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate forecasts, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI), prepayment and curtailment rates, and estimated remaining loan lives. Although key loss driver assumptions used in the ACL estimate remained largely stable from the estimate as of December 31, 2023 to the estimate as of September 30, 2024, the ACL on absolute terms increased based on growth in the loan and lease portfolio and changes in the composition of the portfolio along with slower prepayment and curtailment rates offset by more favorable economic forecasts. 
 
 Qualitative factors for the ACL estimate as of September 30, 2024 saw a general decrease compared to the prior quarter based on reduction in the qualitative factor for the effect of other external factors on estimated credit losses for all pools based on strong third party assessments of the Company s asset quality.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs against the allowance totaled 251 thousand compared with net charge-offs of 516 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 265 thousand, or 51 , decrease due to two recoveries from two commercial real estate borrowers totaling 304 thousand and a 40 thousand recovery from a single residential borrower. Net charge-offs declined as a percentage of the total loan portfolio at 0.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For a discussion on the provision for credit losses, see the Provision for credit losses, located in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis contained herein. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses can generally absorb losses throughout the loan portfolio. However, in some instances an allocation is made for specific loans or groups of loans. Allocation of the allowance for credit losses for different categories of loans is based on the methodology used by the Company, as previously explained. The changes in the allocations from period-to-period are based upon quarter-end reviews of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Allocation of the allowance among major categories of loans for the periods indicated, as well as the percentage of loans in each category to total loans, is summarized in the following table. This table should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or proportions, or that the allocation indicates future charge-off trends.

As of September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate loan portfolio comprised 46 of the total allowance for credit losses, down 1 percentage point from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate loan portfolio was 41 of the total loan and lease portfolio indicative of a higher relative reserve, which is attributed to the longer average duration and inherent risk of the portfolio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the commercial and industrial portfolio, comprised 13 of the total allowance for credit losses, up 3 percentage point from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the commercial and industrial portfolio was 16 of the total loan and lease portfolio indicative of a lower relative reserve, which is attributed to the shorter average duration of this portfolio and lower relative risk, specifically from the municipal portfolio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the consumer portfolio, comprised 12 of the total allowance for credit losses, down 1 percentage point from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the consumer portfolio is 14 of the total loan and lease portfolio indicative of a lower relative reserve, which is attributed to the shorter average duration of this portfolio and lower relative risk, specifically from the indirect recourse and direct finance lease portfolios. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the residential portfolio comprised 29 of the total allowance for credit losses, down 1 percentage point from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the residential portfolio is 29 of the total loan and lease portfolio indicative of a reserve that is proportionally representative of the loan portfolio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unallocated reserve, representing the portion of the allowance not specifically identified with a loan or groups of loans, was less than 1 of the total allowance for credit losses, unchanged from December 31, 2023. 
 
 Non-performing assets 
 
 The Company defines non-performing assets as accruing loans past due 90 days or more, non-accrual loans, other real estate owned (ORE) and repossessed assets.

Management continually monitors the loan portfolio to identify loans that are either delinquent or are otherwise deemed by management unable to repay in accordance with contractual terms. Generally, loans of all types are placed on non-accrual status if a loan of any type is past due 90 or more days or if collection of principal and interest is in doubt. Further, unsecured consumer loans are charged-off when the principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due. Uncollected interest income accrued on all loans placed on non-accrual is reversed and charged to interest income. 
 
 Non-performing assets represented 0.29 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared with 0.13 at December 31, 2023. The increase resulted from a 4.3 million, or 128 , increase in non-performing assets, specifically non-accrual loans, which increased due to 2.9 million in loans to a single commercial borrower added to non-accrual, a 0.4 million commercial real estate non-owner-occupied loan added to non-accrual, and a 0.3 million residential real estate loan added to non-accrual during the year. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, there were a total of 35 non-accrual loans to 29 unrelated borrowers with balances that ranged from less than 1 thousand to 2.6 million, or 7.1 million in the aggregate. On December 31, 2023, there were a total of 32 non-accrual loans to 26 unrelated borrowers with balances that ranged from less than 1 thousand to 1.3 million, or 3.3 million in the aggregate. 
 
 Loans past due 90 days or more accruing totaled 66 thousand, which was comprised of three direct finance leases and one recourse auto loan as of September 30, 2024, compared to one direct finance lease totaling 14 thousand as of December 31, 2023. All loans were well secured and in the process of collection. 
 
 The Company seeks payments from all past due customers through an aggressive customer communication process. Unless well-secured and in the process of collection, past due loans will be placed on non-accrual at the 90-day point when it is deemed that a customer is non-responsive and uncooperative to collection efforts.

Payments received from non-accrual loans are recognized on a cost recovery method. Payments are first applied to the outstanding principal balance, then to the recovery of any charged-off loan amounts. Any excess is treated as a recovery of interest income. If the non-accrual loans that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 had been performing in accordance with their original terms, the Company would have recognized interest income with respect to such loans of 265 thousand. 
 
 Foreclosed assets held-for-sale 
 
 From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, foreclosed assets held-for-sale (ORE) increased from 1 thousand to 430 thousand, a 429 thousand increase, which was attributed to the addition of four properties to two borrowers totaling 649 thousand, which were added to ORE during 2024. These additions were offset by the sale of one commercial property totaling 1 thousand and addition and subsequent sale of one commercial property totaling 219 thousand.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had three properties totaling 430 thousand, which were all under agreement of sale. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had one other repossessed asset totaling 10 thousand which was a vehicle that is to be sold. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no other repossessed assets. 

Cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
 
 The Company maintains bank owned life insurance (BOLI) for a chosen group of employees at the time of purchase, namely its officers, where the Company is the owner and sole beneficiary of the policies. BOLI is classified as a non-interest earning asset. Increases or decreases in the cash surrender value are recorded as components of non-interest income. The BOLI is profitable from the appreciation of the cash surrender values of the pool of insurance and its tax-free advantage to the Company. This profitability is used to offset a portion of current and future employee benefit costs. The BOLI cash surrender value build-up can be liquidated if necessary, with associated tax costs. However, the Company intends to hold this pool of insurance, because it provides income that supports employee benefit cost increases which enhances the Company s capital position. Therefore, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on the earnings from the increase in cash surrender value. 
 
 Premises and equipment 
 
 Net of depreciation, premises and equipment increased 1.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. The Company purchased 1.2 million in fixed assets and added 2.9 million in construction in process during the first nine months of 2024. These increases were offset by 1.8 million in depreciation expense and assets totaling 0.5 million that were transferred to other assets. The Company opened a new branch in Wilkes-Barre in 2023. The Company opened a new Easton Branch in July 2024. The Company has substantially completed the remodeling of the Main Branch located in Dunmore, PA. The Company is in process of corporate headquarters construction which may continue to increase construction in process and is evaluating its branch network looking for consolidation that makes sense for more efficient operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 5.7 million in costs for the corporate headquarters building in downtown Scranton and currently estimates, based on available information, that remaining costs could range from 19 million to 22 million. This range estimate may expand because it is subject to supply chain issues, commodities and labor pricing, results of final planning, and because of the renovation of the historic building requiring upgrades to meet current codes and system enhancements. On December 23, 2020, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania authorized the release of 2.0 million in Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) funding for the Company s headquarters project in Lackawanna County. On December 2, 2021, the Company announced it would be receiving an additional 2.0 million in RACP funding in support of the project. On November 1, 2024, the Company announced it would be receiving an additional 5.0 million in RACP funding in support of the project. The 9.0 million in total RACP grant funds will be allocated to the renovation and rehabilitation of the historic Scranton electric building. The historic nature of this building has qualified the Company for an estimated 4.1 million in state and federal historic tax credits. The project is expected to be completed in the middle of 2026. 
 
 Other assets 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the 2.0 million decrease in other assets was due mostly to a 1.4 million decrease in deferred tax assets.

 Deposits 
 
 The Company is a community based commercial depository financial institution, member FDIC, which offers a variety of deposit products with varying ranges of interest rates and terms. Generally, deposits are obtained from consumers, businesses and public entities within the communities that surround the Company s 21 branch offices and all deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the full extent permitted by law. Deposit products consist of transaction accounts including: savings; clubs; interest-bearing checking; money market and non-interest bearing checking (DDA). The Company also offers short- and long-term time deposits or certificates of deposit (CDs). CDs are deposits with stated maturities which can range from seven days to ten years. Cash flow from deposits is influenced by economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment, pricing and competition. To determine interest rates on its deposit products, the Company considers local competition, spreads to earning-asset yields, liquidity position and rates charged for alternative sources of funding such as short-term borrowings and FHLB advances.

Total deposits increased 184.1 million, or 9 , to 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Money market accounts increased 98.7 million primarily due to an increase in business and personal account balances and transfers of funds from checking and savings accounts. During the first nine months of 2024, two accounts to one public customer with a balance of 12.2 million at the end of 2023 were transferred from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing checking accounts. Excluding the transfer, non-interest bearing checking accounts would have increased 25.8 million due to an increase in business checking balances. Savings decreased 12.6 million during the first nine months of 2024. This decline is due to increased spending and shifts to higher rate CDs and money market accounts. Interest-bearing checking accounts decreased 11.7 million despite the purchase of 30 million in Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) one-way buy deposits at the end of the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to one relationship that transferred approximately 45 million from interest-bearing checking accounts to CDs. The Company focuses on obtaining a full-banking relationship with existing core operating checking account customers as well as forming new customer relationships. The Company will continue to execute on its relationship development strategy, explore the demographics within its marketplace and develop targeted programs for its customers to maintain and grow core deposits. For 2023 and 2024, the Company experienced deposit balance declines as clients transferred their deposits to investments to earn higher interest and pay down debts along with increased consumer spending. We currently expect this trend of cash usage, due to the impact of inflation on consumer and business spending and deposit mix shifts caused by the highly competitive interest rate environment, to continue throughout the remainder of 2024. This will begin to be offset by the decreasing rate environment which began in the third quarter of 2024 and is expected to continue through 2025 as noted in the general section above. Seasonal public deposit fluctuations are expected to remain volatile and at times may partially offset future deposit growth. 
 
 Offsetting these non-maturing deposit decreases, CDs increased 96.1 million, or 45 , as of September 30, 2024. One relationship transferred approximately 45 million from interest-bearing checking accounts to Company uses the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS). The Company expects the highly competitive deposit environment to continue with a need for promotional money market and CDs to attract new funds. For the remainder of 2024, the Company expects the majority of deposit growth to be in the money market and CD portfolio. 
 
 The CDARS reciprocal program and ICS reciprocal program to obtain FDIC insurance protection for customers who have large deposits that at times may exceed the FDIC maximum insured amount of 250,000. The Company had 46.6 million and 1.4 million in CDARS as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ICS reciprocal deposits represented 123.2 million and 151.4 million, or 5 and 7 , of total deposits which are included in interest-bearing checking accounts in the table above. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also purchased 30.0 million from the ICS one-way buy program which is included in interest-bearing checking accounts. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total uninsured deposits were estimated to be 926.8 million, or 40 of total deposits. The estimate of uninsured deposits is based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements. The Company aggregates deposit products by taxpayer identification number and classifies into ownership categories to estimate amounts over the FDIC insurance limit. As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of uninsured and non-collateralized deposits to total deposits was 592.0 million, or 25 . Collateralized deposits totaled 334.8 million, or 14 , of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The maturity distribution of certificates of deposit that meet or exceed the FDIC limit, by account, at September 30, 2024 is as follows:

Approximately 17 of the CDs, with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.91 , are scheduled to mature in 2024 and an additional 80 , with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.41 , are scheduled to mature in 2025. Renewing CDs are currently expected to re-price to lower market rates depending on the rate on the maturing CD, the pace and direction of interest rate movements, the shape of the yield curve, competition, the rate profile of the maturing accounts and depositor preference for alternative, non-term products. The Company continues to address maturing CDs on a relationship pricing basis, with both CD retention and promotional programs and a rate match when prudent to maintain relationships. Current CD retention is over 80 . The Company will continue to develop CD retention and promotional programs when the Company deems that it is economically feasible to do so or when demand exists. The Company will consider the needs of the customers and simultaneously be mindful of the liquidity levels, borrowing rates and the interest rate sensitivity exposure of the Company.

Short-term borrowings 
 
 Borrowings are used as a complement to deposit generation as an alternative funding source whereby the Company will borrow under advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, Federal Reserve Bank discount window, and other correspondent banks for asset growth and liquidity needs. 
 
 Short-term borrowings may include overnight balances with FHLB's line of credit and/or correspondent bank s federal funds lines which the Company may require to fund daily liquidity needs such as deposit outflow, loan demand and operations. The Company used 25.0 million in short-term borrowings to fund loan growth as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the short-term borrowings were comprised of 25.0 million borrowed through the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) up to one year with a rate of 4.76 by pledging 26.5 million in securities. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Compaid used excess cash to pay off the BTFP. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the ability to borrow an additional 150.7 million from the Federal Reserve borrower-in-custody program, full availability of 150.0 million in overnight borrowings with the FHLB open-repo line of credit and 20.0 million from lines of credit with correspondent banks. 
 
 Secured borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5 secured borrowing agreements with third parties with a carrying value of 6.3 million compared to 8 secured borrowing agreements with third parties with a carrying value of 7.4 million, related to certain sold loan participations that did not qualify for sales treatment acquired from Landmark Community Bank. Secured borrowings are expected to decrease throughout 2024 from scheduled amortization and, when possible, early pay-offs. 
 
 FHLB advances 
 
 The Company had no FHLB advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the ability to borrow up to 704.4 million from the FHLB, net of any overnight borrowings utilized. The Company does not expect to have any FHLB advances for the remainder of 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 
 Management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis. 
 
 The adequacy and effectiveness of an institution s interest rate risk management process and the level of its exposures are critical factors in the regulatory evaluation of an institution s sensitivity to changes in interest rates and capital adequacy. Management believes the Company s interest rate risk measurement framework is sound and provides an effective means to measure, monitor, analyze, identify and control interest rate risk in the balance sheet. 
 
 The Company is subject to the interest rate risks inherent in its lending, investing and financing activities. Fluctuations of interest rates will impact interest income and interest expense along with affecting market values of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, except for those assets or liabilities with a short-term remaining to maturity. Interest rate risk management is an integral part of the asset/liability management process. The Company has instituted certain procedures and policy guidelines to manage the interest rate risk position. Those internal policies enable the Company to react to changes in market rates to protect net interest income from significant fluctuations. The primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income along with creating an asset/liability structure that maximizes earnings. 
 
 Asset/Liability Management. One major objective of the Company when managing the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities is to stabilize net interest income. The management of and authority to assume interest rate risk is the responsibility of the Company s Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO), which is comprised of senior management and members of the board of directors. ALCO meets quarterly to monitor the relationship of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities. The process to review interest rate risk is a regular part of managing the Company. Consistent policies and practices of measuring and reporting interest rate risk exposure, particularly regarding the treatment of non-contractual assets and liabilities, are in effect. In addition, there is an annual process to review the interest rate risk policy with the board of directors which includes limits on the impact to earnings from shifts in interest rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Measurement. Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures: static gap analysis, earnings at risk simulation and economic value at risk simulation. While each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations, collectively, they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the Company and the distribution of risk along the yield curve, the level of risk through time and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. 
 
 Static Gap . The ratio between assets and liabilities re-pricing in specific time intervals is referred to as an interest rate sensitivity gap. Interest rate sensitivity gaps can be managed to take advantage of the slope of the yield curve as well as forecasted changes in the level of interest rate changes. 

53

Table of Contents 

To manage this interest rate sensitivity gap position, an asset/liability model commonly known as cumulative gap analysis is used to monitor the difference in the volume of the Company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or re-price within given time intervals. A positive gap (asset sensitive) indicates that more assets will re-price during a given period compared to liabilities, while a negative gap (liability sensitive) indicates the opposite effect. The Company employs computerized net interest income simulation modeling to assist in quantifying interest rate risk exposure. This process measures and quantifies the impact on net interest income through varying interest rate changes and balance sheet compositions. The use of this model assists the ALCO in gauging the effects of interest rate changes on interest-sensitive assets and liabilities in order to determine what impact these rate changes will have upon the net interest spread. At September 30, 2024, the Company maintained a one-year cumulative gap of positive (asset sensitive) 21.8 million, or 0.8 , of total assets. The effect of this positive gap position provided a mismatch of assets and liabilities which may expose the Company to interest rate risk during periods of falling interest rates. Conversely, in an increasing interest rate environment, net interest income could be positively impacted because more assets than liabilities will re-price upward during the one-year period. 
 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis discussed above and presented in the next table. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table amounts. The ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.

 Includes restricted investments in bank stock and the net unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities. 

(2) 
 Investments and loans are included in the earlier of the period in which interest rates were next scheduled to adjust or the period in which they are due. In addition, loans were included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid based on scheduled amortization. For amortizing loans and MBS GSE residential, annual prepayment rates are assumed reflecting historical experience as well as management s knowledge and experience of its loan products. 

(3) 
 The Company s demand and savings accounts were generally subject to immediate withdrawal. However, management considers a certain amount of such accounts to be core accounts having significantly longer effective maturities based on the retention experiences of such deposits in changing interest rate environments. The effective maturities presented are the recommended maturity distribution limits for non-maturing deposits based on historical deposit studies. 

Earnings at Risk and Economic Value at Risk Simulations . The Company recognizes that more sophisticated tools exist for measuring the interest rate risk in the balance sheet that extend beyond static re-pricing gap analysis. Although it will continue to measure its re-pricing gap position, the Company utilizes additional modeling for identifying and measuring the interest rate risk in the overall balance sheet. The ALCO is responsible for focusing on earnings at risk and economic value at risk , and how both relate to the risk-based capital position when analyzing the interest rate risk. 
 
 Earnings at Risk . An earnings at risk simulation measures the change in net interest income and net income should interest rates rise and fall. The simulation recognizes that not all assets and liabilities re-price one-for-one with market rates (e.g., savings rate). The ALCO looks at earnings at risk to determine income changes from a base case scenario under an increase and decrease of 200 basis points in interest rate simulation models. 

54

Table of Contents 

Economic Value at Risk. An earnings at risk simulation measures the short-term risk in the balance sheet. Economic value (or portfolio equity) at risk measures the long-term risk by finding the net present value of the future cash flows from the Company s existing assets and liabilities. The ALCO examines this ratio quarterly utilizing an increase and decrease of 200 basis points in interest rate simulation models. The ALCO recognizes that, in some instances, this ratio may contradict the earnings at risk ratio. 
 
 The following table illustrates the simulated impact of an immediate 200 basis points upward or downward movement in interest rates on net interest income, net income and the change in the economic value (portfolio equity). This analysis assumed that the adjusted interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels at September 30, 2024 remained constant. The impact of the rate movements was developed by simulating the effect of the rate change over a twelve-month period from the September 30, 2024 levels:

In the scenarios in the above table, the Board-approved policy has the following guidelines: net interest income within +/- 10 , net income within +/- 25 , economic value of equity within +/- 25 , economic value of equity as a percent of total assets within +/-5 . 
 
 Economic value has the most meaning when viewed within the context of risk-based capital. Therefore, the economic value may normally change beyond the Company s policy guideline for a short period of time as long as the risk-based capital ratio (after adjusting for the excess equity exposure) is greater than 10 . At September 30, 2024, the Company s risk-based capital ratio was 14.56 . 
 
 Given the existing economic and interest rate conditions along with the recent increase in earnings at risk exposure to rising rates, management is evaluating to pursue balance sheet hedging opportunities on both sides of balance sheet with an independent third-party vendor with derivative expertise in response to mitigate these interest rate risks on net interest income. The Company has a derivative policy in place and any balance sheet hedges require Board pre-approval along with quarterly monitoring requirements by the Company's ALCO Committee.

Simulation models require assumptions about certain categories of assets and liabilities. The models schedule existing assets and liabilities by their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date or earliest re-pricing opportunity. MBS GSE residential securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow including estimated prepayments. For investment securities, the Company uses a third-party service to provide cash flow estimates in the various rate environments. Savings, money market and interest-bearing checking accounts do not have stated maturities or re-pricing terms and can be withdrawn or re-price at any time. This may impact the margin if more expensive alternative sources of deposits are required to fund loans or deposit runoff. Management projects the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and assumptions that it believes reflect their rate sensitivity. The model reinvests all maturities, repayments and prepayments for each type of asset or liability into the same product for a new like term at current product interest rates. As a result, the mix of interest-earning assets and interest bearing-liabilities is held constant. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity management ensures that adequate funds will be available to meet customers needs for borrowings, deposit withdrawals and maturities, facility expansion and normal operating expenses. Sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, asset maturities and pay-downs within one year, loans HFS, investments AFS, growth of core deposits, utilization of borrowing capacities from the FHLB, correspondent banks, IntraFi's ICS and One-Way Buy program, the Discount Window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (FRB), Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB) and proceeds from the issuance of capital stock. Though regularly scheduled investment and loan payments are dependable sources of daily liquidity, sales of both loans HFS and investments AFS, deposit activity and investment and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general economic conditions including the interest rate environment. During low and declining interest rate environments, prepayments from interest-sensitive assets tend to accelerate and provide significant liquidity that can be used to invest in other interest-earning assets but at lower market rates. Conversely, in periods of high or rising interest rates, prepayments from interest-sensitive assets tend to decelerate causing prepayment cash flows from mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to decrease. Rising interest rates may also cause deposit inflow but priced at higher market interest rates or could also cause deposit outflow due to higher rates offered by the Company s competition for similar products. The Company closely monitors activity in the capital markets and takes appropriate action to ensure that the liquidity levels are adequate for funding, investing and operating activities.

Table of Contents 

The Company s contingency funding plan (CFP) sets a framework for handling liquidity issues in the event circumstances arise which the Company deems to be less than normal. The Company established guidelines for identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing the resolution of potentially serious liquidity crises. The CFP outlines required monitoring tools, acceptable alternative funding sources and required actions during various liquidity scenarios. Thus, the Company has implemented a proactive means for the measurement and resolution for handling potentially significant adverse liquidity conditions. At least quarterly, the CFP monitoring tools, current liquidity position and monthly projected liquidity sources and uses are presented and reviewed by the Company s Asset/Liability Committee. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not experienced any adverse issues that would give rise to its inability to raise liquidity in an emergency situation. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company grew cash and cash equivalents by 8.2 million. During the period, the Company s operations provided approximately 23.1 million mostly from 47.9 million of net cash inflow from the components of net interest income partially offset by net non-interest expense/income related payments of 23.0 million and 3.1 million of tax payments. Cash inflow from interest-earning assets, deposit growth and loan payments were used to fund the loan portfolio, pay down short-term borrowings, invest in bank premises and equipment and make net dividend payments. The Company received a large amount of public deposits over the past few years. The seasonal nature of deposits from municipalities and other public funding sources requires the Company to be prepared for the inherent volatility and the unpredictable timing of cash outflow from this customer base, including maintaining the requirements to pledge investment securities. Accordingly, the use of short-term overnight borrowings could be used to fulfill funding gap needs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 170.0 million in unpledged securities. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company paid off 25 million borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program using excess cash balances. The payoff freed up 26.5 million in pledged securities. 
 
 During 2021 and 2022, the Company also experienced deposit inflow resulting from businesses and municipalities that received relief from the CARES Act, American Rescue Plan Act ("ARPA") and other government stimulus. There is uncertainty about the length of time that these deposits will remain which could require the Company to maintain elevated cash balances. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company experienced an outflow of 18.3 million in ARPA funds, or approximately 59 of the balance of these funds from the end of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 12.5 million in remaining ARPA balances. The Company will continue to monitor deposit fluctuations for other significant changes. 
 
 The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with the overall interest rate management strategy. These instruments involve, to a varying degree, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are either not recorded in the consolidated financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. Such instruments primarily include lending commitments. 
 
 Lending commitments include commitments to originate loans and commitments to fund unused lines of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Unfunded commitments of existing loan facilities totaled 463.8 million, standby letters of credit totaled 29.7 million and the level of uninsured and non-collateralized deposits was 592.0 million at September 30, 2024. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintained 120.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 336.2 million of investments AFS and loans HFS. Also as of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 704.4 million available borrowing capacity from the FHLB, 20.0 million from correspondent banks, 150.7 million from the FRB, and 345.1 million from the IntraFi Network One-Way Buy program. The combined total of 
 1.7 billion represented 64 of total assets at September 30, 2024. Management believes this level of liquidity to be strong and adequate to support current operations. 
 
 Capital 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total shareholders' equity increased 17.8 million, or 9 , due principally to 15.0 million in net income added into retained earnings and a 8.0 million after tax decrease in the net unrealized loss position in the Company s investment portfolio. Capital was further enhanced by 0.1 million from the issuance of common stock through the DRP, 0.3 million from investments in the Company s common stock via the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and 1.1 million from stock-based compensation expense from the ESPP and restricted stock. Partially offsetting these increases, there were 6.6 million of cash dividends declared on the Company s common stock. The Company s dividend payout ratio, defined as the rate at which current earnings are paid to shareholders, was 44.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The balance of earnings is retained to further strengthen the Company s capital position. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net unrealized loss position of 48.5 million, net of tax, from the securities portfolio compared to a net unrealized loss of 56.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The 8.0 million increase to accumulated other comprehensive income during first nine months of 2024 was primarily from the 6.6 million decrease in net unrealized losses on AFS securities. Management believes that changes in fair value of the Company s securities are due to changes in interest rates and market conditions, and not in the creditworthiness of the issuers. 
 
 Generally, when U.S. Treasury rates rise, investment securities pricing declines and fair values of investment securities also decline. While volatility has existed in the yield curve within the past twelve months, a declining rate environment has begun in the third quarter of 2024 into fiscal year 2025, the Company expects pricing in the bond portfolio to improve. There is no assurance that future realized and unrealized losses will not be recognized from the Company s portfolio of investment securities. 
 
 The tangible common equity (TCE) ratio (non-GAAP) was 7.19 and 5.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the held-to-maturity securities portfolio had 17.5 million and 36.2 million in unrealized losses, net of deferred taxes. If the TCE ratio was adjusted to include the unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities, the adjusted TCE ratio (non-GAAP) would have been 6.52 and 4.41 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See reconciliation on page 37. 
 
 To help maintain a healthy capital position, the Company can issue stock to participants in the DRP and ESPP plans. The DRP affords the Company the option to acquire shares in open market purchases and/or issue shares directly from the Company to plan participants. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company re-issued treasury shares to fulfill the needs of the DRP. Both the DRP and the ESPP plans have been a consistent source of capital from the Company s loyal employees and shareholders and their participation in these plans will continue to help strengthen the Company s balance sheet.

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors. Since the Company (on a consolidated basis) is currently considered a small bank holding company, it is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Under these guidelines, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets. The guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total risk-based capital to total risk-weighted assets (Total Risk Adjusted Capital) of 8 , including Tier I common equity to total risk-weighted assets (Tier I Common Equity) of 4.5 , Tier I capital to total risk-weighted assets (Tier I Capital) of 6 and Tier I capital to average total assets (Leverage Ratio) of at least 4 . A capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier I capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements of 2.50 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject. 
 
 The following table depicts the actual and required capital and related capital ratios of the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. No amounts were deducted from capital for interest-rate risk in either 2024 or 2023.
