 . At September 30, 2024, our environmental accrual of million represented our estimate of the incremental remediation cost based on: (i) proposed alternatives in the final feasibility study related to Trentwood; (ii) currently available facts with respect to Newark; and (iii) facts related to certain other locations owned or formerly owned by us. In accordance with approved and proposed remediation action plans, we expect that the implementation and ongoing monitoring could occur over a period of or more years. As additional facts are developed, feasibility studies are completed, remediation plans are modified, necessary regulatory approvals for the implementation of remediation are obtained, alternative technologies are developed and/or other factors change, there may be revisions to management s estimates, and actual costs may exceed the current environmental accruals. We believe at this time that it is reasonably possible that undiscounted costs associated with these environmental matters may exceed current accruals by amounts that could be, in the aggregate, up to an estimated million over the remediation period. It is reasonably possible that our recorded estimate will change in the next . Other Contingencies. We are party to various lawsuits, claims, investigations and administrative proceedings that arise in connection with past and current operations. We evaluate such matters on a case-by-case basis and our policy is to vigorously contest any such claims we believe are without merit. We accrue for a legal liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Quarterly, in addition to when changes in facts and circumstances require it, we review and adjust these accruals to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. While uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of such matters and it is presently impossible to determine the actual cost that may ultimately be incurred, we believe that we have sufficiently accrued for such matters and that the ultimate resolution of pending matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, operating results or liquidity.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements appear throughout this Report and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, estimates, will, should, plans or anticipates, or the negative of the foregoing or other variations of comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. Readers are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties and that actual results may vary from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include: (i) the effectiveness of management s strategies and decisions, including strategic investments, capital spending strategies, cost reduction initiatives, sourcing strategies, processes and countermeasures implemented to address operational and supply chain challenges and the execution of those strategies; (ii) the execution and timing of strategic investments; (iii) general economic and business conditions, including the impact of geopolitical factors and governmental and other actions taken in response, cyclicality, reshoring, labor challenges, supply interruptions, customer disruptions, customer inventory imbalances and supply chain issues, and other conditions that impact demand drivers in the Aero/HS Products, Packaging, GE Products, Automotive Extrusions and other end markets we serve; (iv) our ability to participate in mature and anticipated new automotive programs expected to launch in the future and successfully launch new automotive programs; (v) changes or shifts in defense spending due to competing national priorities; (vi) pricing, market conditions and our ability to effectively execute commercial and labor strategies, pass through cost increases, including the institution of surcharges, and flex costs in response to inflation, volatile commodity costs and changing economic conditions; (vii) developments in technology; (viii) the impact of our future earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors on our financial strength and flexibility; (ix) new or modified statutory or regulatory requirements; (x) the successful integration of acquired operations and technologies and (xi) stakeholders , including regulators and customers , views regarding our sustainability goals and initiatives and the impact of factors outside of our control on such goals and initiatives. This Item and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, each identify other factors that could cause actual results to vary. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. We have provided a reconciliation of non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables. We have also provided discussion of the reasons we believe that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as well as any additional ways in which we use the non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the following discussions are Conversion Revenue (defined as Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, see below in Metal Pricing Policies discussion), Adjusted EBITDA and ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors. 
 In the discussion of operating results below, we refer to certain items as non-run-rate items. For purposes of such discussion, non-run-rate items are items that, while they may recur from period-to-period: (i) are particularly material to results; (ii) affect costs primarily as a result of external market factors; and (iii) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. Non-run-rate items are part of our business and operating environment but are worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow users of the financial statements to consider our results both in light of and separately from such items. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, see below in Results of Operations - Selected Operational and Financial Information. Reconciliations of certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not provided because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted or provided without unreasonable effort. 
 Metal Pricing Policies 
 A fundamental part of our business model is to remain neutral to the impact from fluctuations in the market price for aluminum and certain alloys, thereby earning profit predominantly from the conversion of aluminum into semi-fabricated mill products. We refer to this as metal price neutrality. We purchase primary, rolling ingot and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our main raw material, and 
 22 

alloys at prices that fluctuate on a monthly basis, and our pricing policies generally allow us to pass the underlying index cost of aluminum and certain alloys through to our customers so that we remain neutral to metal pricing. However, for some of our higher margin products sold on a spot basis, competitive dynamics may limit the amount and/or delay the timing of selling price increases to recover our increased aluminum and alloy costs, resulting in a lag up to several months during which we may be exposed to metal price risk. As a result, we can experience an adverse impact when aluminum and alloy prices increase, and a favorable impact to us when aluminum and alloy prices decline, as we and our competitors tend to defer adjusting pricing unless required by market dynamics in a declining metal cost environment. Similarly, we typically purchase scrap at a discount to the index price of aluminum which can vary depending on market dynamics and availability. As a result, we can experience an adverse impact when scrap discounts decrease and a favorable impact when scrap discounts increase. We may also enter into firm-price customer sales agreements that specify a firm underlying metal price plus a conversion price. Spot sales with lagged aluminum and alloy price pass through and firm-price sales agreements create price exposure for us, which we mitigate through hedging and related programs with an objective to remain metal price neutral. Additionally, we have certain contracts that may adjust certain alloy prices for a forward period based on an average prior period cost for such alloys. As a result, until the selling price resets, we can experience an adverse impact when alloy prices increase and a favorable impact when alloy prices decrease. 
 Our pricing policies and hedging program are intended to significantly reduce or eliminate the impact on our profitability of fluctuations in the underlying price of primary, rolling ingot and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our main raw material, and certain alloys so that our earnings are predominantly associated with the conversion of aluminum to semi fabricated mill products. To allow users of our financial statements to consider the impact of aluminum and alloy cost on our Net sales, we disclose Net sales as well as Conversion Revenue, which is Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal. As used in this discussion, Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal is the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP plus the cost of alloying elements and any realized gains and/or losses on settled hedges related to the metal sold in the referenced period. The average MWTP of aluminum reflects the primary aluminum supply/demand dynamics in North America. For a reconciliation of Conversion Revenue to Net sales, see below in Results of Operations - Selected Operational and Financial Information. 
 Business Overview 
 We manufacture and sell semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products for the following end market applications: (i) Aero/HS Products; (ii) Packaging; (iii) GE Products; (iv) Automotive Extrusions; and (v) Other products. Our fabricated aluminum mill products include flat-rolled (plate, sheet and coil), extruded (rod, bar, hollows and shapes), drawn (rod, bar, pipe, tube and wire) and certain cast aluminum products. The sophistication of our products is due to the metallurgy and physical properties of the metal and the special characteristics that are required for particular end uses. We strategically choose to serve technically challenging applications for which we can deploy our core metallurgical and process technology capabilities to produce highly engineered mill products with differentiated characteristics that present opportunities for us to receive premium pricing and to create long-term profitable growth. 
 With respect to the global market for flat-rolled aluminum mill products, our focus is on heat treat plate and sheet for applications that require higher strength and other desired product attributes that cannot be achieved by common alloy rolled products. The primary end market applications of flat-rolled heat treat plate and sheet, which are produced at Trentwood, are Aero/HS Products (which we sell globally) and GE Products (which we predominantly sell within North America). The primary end market application of bare and coated aluminum coil, which are produced at Warrick, is Packaging (which we sell in North America). Our Packaging products require demanding attributes and can be further processed to include coating and slitting depending on customer specifications. 
 In the areas of aluminum extrusions, we focus on demanding Aero/HS Products, GE Products, and Automotive Extrusions that require high strength, machinability or other specific properties where we can create and maintain a defensible competitive position because of our technical expertise, strong production capability and high product quality. Our 10 active extrusion/drawing facilities, nine of which are in the United States and one of which is in Canada, serve primarily North American demand for aerospace, general engineering, or automotive applications. Additionally, we have a facility in Columbia, New Jersey, that focuses on multi-material advanced manufacturing methods and techniques, which include multi-axis computer numerical control machining, additive manufacturing 3D Printing ), welding and fabrication for demanding aerospace and defense, high technology, general industrial, and automotive applications. Our consolidated Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2,258.6 million on approximately 880.0 million pounds shipped from our facilities. We employed approximately 4,000 people at September 30, 2024. 
 We have long-standing relationships with our customers, which consist primarily of blue-chip companies including leading aerospace and automotive manufacturers, tier one aerospace and automotive suppliers, food and beverage packaging manufacturers, and metal service centers. Approximately 75 of our shipments is sold direct to manufacturers or tier one suppliers and approximately 25 is sold to metal service centers. In our served markets, we seek to be the supplier of choice by pursuing Best in Class customer satisfaction driven by quality, availability, service and delivery performance. We believe we differentiate our product portfolio through our broad product offering and our Kaiser Select products, which are engineered and manufactured to deliver enhanced product 
 23 

characteristics with improved consistency, so as to result in better performance, lower waste and, in many cases, lower production cost for our customers. 
 Highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024: 
 Net sales 747.7 million; Conversion Revenue 362.0 million; 

Net income 12.0 million; Net income per diluted share 0.74; and 

Cash dividends and dividend equivalents of 0.77 per share or 12.7 million paid during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Net Sales. Net sales totaled 747.7 million and 743.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting a 7.1 million pound (2 decrease in shipment volume and an 0.08/lb (3 increase in average realized sales price per pound. The shipment volume decrease reflected: (i) a 4.7 million pound (7 decrease in Aero/HS Products; (ii) a 3.5 million pound (2 decrease in Packaging; (iii) a 1.1 million pound (52 decrease in Other products; and (iv) a 0.4 million pound (2 decrease in Automotive Extrusions, partially offset by a 2.6 million pound (5 increase in GE Products. The average realized sales price per pound reflected a 0.03/lb (2 increase in the average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal price per pound and a 0.05/lb (4 increase in Conversion Revenue per pound reflecting higher pricing and improved mix. For further details, see the table below in Selected Operational and Financial Information. 
 Net sales totaled 2,258.6 million and 2,365.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting a 32.7 million pound (4 decrease in shipment volume and a 0.02/lb (1 decrease in average realized sales price per pound. The shipment volume decrease reflected: (i) a 32.2 million pound (7 decrease in Packaging; (ii) a 4.5 million pound (58 decrease in Other products; (iii) a 1.7 million pound (1 decrease in Aero/HS Products; and (iv) a 1.3 million pound (2 decrease in Automotive Extrusions, partially offset by a 7.0 million pound (4 increase in GE Products. The average realized sales price per pound reflected a 0.06/lb (4 decrease in the average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal price per pound and a 0.04/lb (3 increase in Conversion Revenue per pound reflecting higher pricing and improved mix. For further details, see the table below in Selected Operational and Financial Information. 
 COGS. COGS for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled 671.8 million, or 90 of Net sales, compared to 665.2 million, or 89 of Net sales, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 6.6 million reflected a 0.7 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, more than offset by a 7.3 million increase in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Of the 0.7 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, 9.2 million was due to lower shipment volume, partially offset by an 8.5 million increase in hedged metal prices (see above in our Net Sales discussion for further details). The 7.3 million increase in net manufacturing conversion and other costs primarily reflected: (i) a 3.3 million increase in legacy environmental costs; (ii) a 2.5 million net increase in costs primarily driven by product mix and higher energy costs; and (iii) a 1.5 million net increase in manufacturing costs, primarily attributable to a 1.8 million increase in LIFO reserve expense. For a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, see below in Selected Operational and Financial Information. 
 COGS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2,005.2 million or 89 of Net sales, compared to 2,114.7 million, or 89 of Net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 109.5 million reflected a 99.6 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal and a 10.0 million decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Of the 99.6 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, 54.3 million was due to lower hedged metal prices and 45.3 million was due to lower shipment volume (see above in our Net Sales discussion for further details). The 10.0 million decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs primarily reflected: (i) a 17.8 million decrease in costs associated with a reduction in pounds shipped; (ii) a 4.9 million decrease in major maintenance costs driven by timing of annual planned maintenance programs, partially offset by: (i) a 6.4 million net increase in manufacturing costs, primarily attributable to an 10.3 million increase in LIFO reserve expense, partially offset by improved metal sourcing; (ii) a 3.2 million increase in legacy environmental costs; and (iii) a 3.1 million increase in energy costs. For a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, see below in Selected Operational and Financial Information.

SG A and R D expense totaled 28.8 million and 30.5 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 93.0 million and 92.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to: (i) a 1.3 million decrease in legal fees and (ii) a 1.0 million decrease in consulting and 
 24 

outsourced services, partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 3.2 million increase in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation, partially offset by: (i) a 1.8 million decrease in legal fees; (ii) a 0.4 million decrease in consulting and outsourced services; and (iii) a 0.3 million decrease in other SG A and R D expenses.

1. Mark-to-market (gain) loss on derivative instruments represents the (gain) loss on non-designated commodity hedges. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the realized impact related to these derivatives upon settlement. 

2. Non-run-rate environmental expenses are related to legacy contingencies from activities at operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006. See Note 7 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the environmental expenses. 

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million higher than Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by improved pricing and product mix. This was offset by: (i) an increase in LIFO reserve expense and (ii) an increase in energy costs. See above in Consolidated Results of Operations for further details. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.3 million higher than Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by improved pricing and product mix and lower major maintenance costs driven by timing of annual planned maintenance programs. This was offset by: (i) an increase in LIFO reserve expense, partially offset by improved metal sourcing and (ii) an increase in energy costs. See above in Consolidated Results of Operations for further details.

1. Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included 383.6 million and 380.0 million, respectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP and the cost of certain alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price exposure on shipments that we hedged with realized losses upon settlement of 2.1 million and 6.5 million in the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and COGS in our Statements of Consolidated Income. Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included 1,158.6 million and 1,245.6 million, respectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP and the cost of certain alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price exposure on shipments that we hedged with realized losses upon settlement of 2.2 million and 14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and COGS in our Statements of Consolidated Income. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for the total realized loss on aluminum hedges for which we hedged the metal price exposure externally.

Outlook 
 We expect demand to be consistent with our previous expectations for the balance of 2024. In the Aero/HS Products end market, we remain cautious on our near-term outlook due to the timing of certain customer commercial and labor negotiations which may have a short-term impact on demand and shipments. In the Packaging end market, industry momentum and performance improvements are expected to continue as Warrick nears the completion of its fourth coating line investment, which will drive margin improvement starting in 2025. In the GE Products end market, destocking within our long products has concluded, and shipment levels are now in better alignment with end market demand. In the Automotive Extrusions end market, we maintain a positive outlook as production for light and heavy truck sport utility vehicle platforms has outpaced broader automotive production rates. 
 Accordingly, for the full year 2024, we expect overall conversion revenue to remain stable with growth up to 1 compared to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margins, less the full year impact from LIFO valuation charges, are expected to improve 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2023 as we continue to implement cost reduction measures in our operations, increase manufacturing efficiencies, and execute our strategic growth initiatives.

See Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included in this Report for further details on our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our most significant sources of liquidity include available cash and cash equivalents, borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, and funds generated from operations. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes have covenants that, we believe, allow us to operate our business with limited restrictions and significant flexibility for the foreseeable future. We do not believe that the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility are reasonably likely to limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity should we choose to do so during the next 12 months, nor do we believe it is likely that during the next 12 months we will trigger the availability threshold that would require measuring and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 At October 21, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We engage in certain customer-based supply chain financing programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivable from certain customers. Costs of these programs are typically reimbursed to us by the customer. Receivables transferred under these customer-based supply chain financing programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales resulting in the derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets. Receivables involved with these customer based supply chain finance programs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 constituted approximately 36 of our Net sales. See Note 9 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details with respect to these supply chain financing programs. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for mandatory principal and cash interest payments on the outstanding borrowings. 
 We do not believe that covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes are reasonably likely to limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should we choose to do so during the next 12 months. 
 Except as otherwise disclosed in this Report, there has been no material change in our material cash requirements from significant contractual obligations, commercial commitments, or off-balance sheet arrangements other than in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures and Investments 
 We strive to strengthen our competitive position across our end markets through strategic capital investment. Significant investments over the past decade have positioned us well with increased capacity and expanded manufacturing capabilities while more recent capital projects have focused on further enhancing manufacturing cost efficiency, improving product quality and promoting operational security, which we believe are critical to maintaining and strengthening our position in an increasingly competitive market environment. A significant portion of our capital spending over the past several years related to the modernization project at Trentwood, which focused on equipment upgrades throughout the process flow to reduce conversion costs, increase efficiency, and further improve our competitive cost position on all products produced at Trentwood. In addition, a significant portion of the investment also focused on modernizing legacy equipment and the process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve Kaiser Select quality enhancements for these Aero/HS Products and GE Products. These improvements have allowed us to gain incremental manufacturing capacity to enable future sales growth. We continue spending on our previously announced capital project to add a fourth coating line at Warrick to increase our capacity for higher margin coated packaging product. 
 Our capital investment plans remain focused on supporting demand growth through capacity expansion, sustaining our operations, enhancing product quality and increasing operating efficiencies. We anticipate total capital spending in 2024 of approximately 180.0 million to 190.0 million, the majority of which will be focused on growth initiatives, primarily reflecting investment in the fourth 
 28 

coating line at Warrick. We expect to continue to deploy capital thoughtfully so that investment decisions align with demand expectations in order to maximize the earnings potential of the business and maintain financial strength and flexibility. 
 Capital investments will be funded using cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or other third-party financing arrangements. The level of anticipated capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on our business plans, our price outlook for fabricated aluminum products, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity, and other factors. No assurance can be provided as to the timing of any such expenditures or the operational benefits expected therefrom. 
 Dividends 
 We have consistently paid a quarterly cash dividend since the second quarter of 2007 to holders of our common stock, including holders of restricted stock. Nevertheless, as in the past, the future declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial and operating results, including the availability of surplus and/or net profits, liquidity position, anticipated cash requirements and contractual restrictions under our Revolving Credit Facility, the indentures for our Senior Notes or other indebtedness we may incur in the future. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid in the future. 
 We also pay quarterly dividend equivalents to the holders of certain restricted stock units. Holders of performance shares are not paid a quarterly dividend equivalent, but instead are entitled to receive, in connection with the issuance of underlying shares of common stock for performance shares that ultimately vest, a one-time payment equal to the dividends such holders would have received if the number of such shares of common stock so issued had been held of record by such holders from the date of grant of such performance shares through the date of such issuance. 
 See our Statements of Consolidated Stockholders Equity and Note 14 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information regarding dividends paid during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and declared subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 Repurchases of Common Stock 
 We suspended share repurchases as of March 2020. We will continue to assess share repurchases as a part of our capital allocation priorities and strategic investment opportunities identified to support further growth in our business. At September 30, 2024, 93.1 million remained authorized and available for future repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program. 
 See our Statements of Consolidated Stockholders Equity included in this Report for information regarding minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 in connection with the vesting of non vested shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates and policies since December 31, 2023. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with Note 5 and Note 8 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Our operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of primary aluminum, certain alloying metals, natural gas, electricity, and foreign currency, and also depend to a significant degree upon the volume and mix of products sold to customers. We have historically utilized hedging transactions to lock in a specified price or range of prices for certain products which we sell or consume in our production process, and to mitigate our exposure to changes in energy prices. 
 Aluminum 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, settlements of derivative contracts were for 117.3 million pounds and 149.7 million pounds, respectively, of hedged shipments sold on pricing terms that created aluminum price risk for us. At September 30, 2024, we had derivative contracts with respect to approximately 31.1 million, 20.5 million and 0.2 million pounds to hedge sales to be made in the remainder of 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, on pricing terms that create aluminum price risk for us. 
 Based on the aluminum derivative positions held by us to hedge firm-price customer sales agreements, we estimate that a 0.10/lb decrease in the LME market price of aluminum as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of 5.2 million and 6.3 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our aluminum derivative positions. Additionally, we estimate that a 0.05/lb decrease in the Midwest premium for aluminum as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of 2.0 million and 1.4 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our aluminum derivative positions. 
 Alloying Metals 
 We are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices of certain alloying metals, especially copper, zinc, and magnesium, to the extent that changes in their prices do not highly correlate with price changes for aluminum. Copper, zinc, magnesium, and certain other metals are used in our remelt operations to cast rolling ingot and extrusion billet with the proper chemistry for our products. From time to time, we enter into forward contract swaps and/or physical delivery commitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in the prices of these alloys. As of September 30, 2024, we had forward swap contracts with settlement dates designed to align with the timing of scheduled purchases of zinc and copper by our manufacturing facilities. We estimate that a 0.10/lb decrease in the market price of zinc and copper as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an unrealized mark to market loss of 1.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our zinc and copper derivative positions. 
 Energy 
 We are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices for natural gas and electricity. We, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, enter into hedging transactions and/or firm-price physical delivery commitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in natural gas and electricity prices. We estimate that a 1.00 per mmbtu decrease in natural gas prices would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of 3.1 million and 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our natural gas derivative positions. We estimate that a 5.00 per Mwh decrease in electricity prices would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of 0.1 million and 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our electricity derivative positions. 
 30 

Foreign Currency 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have hedged the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain lease transactions and equipment purchases denominated in Euros and British Pounds using forward swap contracts with settlement dates through July 2027. We estimate that a 10 decrease in the exchange rate of our hedged foreign currencies to U.S. dollars would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of 1.2 million and 1.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our foreign currency derivative positions. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this Report under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. We had no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1. Under our equity incentive plan, participants may elect to have us withhold common shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising from the recognition of income and the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares. When we withhold these shares, we are required to remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the market price of the shares withheld by us on the date of withholding. The withholding of common shares by us could be deemed a purchase of such common shares. 

2. In September 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of up to 100.0 million. At September 30, 2024, 93.1 million remained available to repurchase our common shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program. The September 2018 authorization does not have an expiration date.

All Borrowing requests which are not made on-line via Agent s electronic platform or portal shall be subject to (and unless Agent elects otherwise in the exercise of its sole discretion, such Borrowings shall not be made until the completion of) Agent s authentication process (with results satisfactory to Agent) prior to the funding of any such requested Revolving Loan. 

(b) Making of Swing Loans . In the case of a Revolving Loan and so long as any of (i) the aggregate amount of Swing Loans made since the last Settlement Date, minus all payments or other amounts applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the amount of the requested Swing Loan does not exceed the greater of 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and 57,500,000, or (ii) Swing Lender, in its sole discretion, agrees to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, Swing Lender shall make a Revolving Loan (any such Revolving Loan made by Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being referred to as a Swing Loan and all such Revolving Loans being referred to as Swing Loans available to Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds in the amount of such Borrowing to the Designated Account. Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including Section 3 applicable to other Revolving Loans, except that all payments (including interest) on any Swing Loan shall be payable to Swing Lender solely for its own account. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii) , Swing Lender shall not make and shall not be obligated to make any Swing Loan if Swing Lender has actual knowledge that (i) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. Swing Lender shall not otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making any Swing Loan. The Swing Loans shall be secured by Agent s Liens, constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. 

(c) Making of Revolving Loans. 

(i) In the event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i) , Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, email, or other electronic form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing; such notification to be sent on the Business Day or U.S. Government Securities Business Day, as applicable, that is (A) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, at least one Business Day prior to the requested Funding Date, or (B) in the case of a SOFR Loan, prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date. If Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing on the Business Day that is one Business Day prior to the Funding Date, then each Lender shall make the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent s Account, not later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date. After Agent s receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans from the Lenders, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account; provided , that subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii) , no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (1) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. 

49 

(ii) Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 9:30 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date relative to a requested Borrowing as to which Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount on the requested Funding Date, then such Lender shall make the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent s Account, no later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the first Business Day after the requested Funding Date (in which case, the interest accrued on such Lender s portion of such Borrowing for the Funding Date shall be for Agent s separate account). If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereby and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted. A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If the amount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Agent, then such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agent s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing. 

(d) Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances . 

(i) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding (but subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv) ), at any time (A) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied, Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Agent s sole discretion, to make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of, Borrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) (the Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i) shall be referred to as Protective Advances ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of all Protective Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the greater of 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and 57,500,000. 

(ii) Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or would be created thereby, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by the greater of 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and 

50 

57,500,000, and (B) subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv) below, after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount. In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by this Section 2.3(d) , regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence. In such circumstances, if any Lender with a Revolver Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders. 

(iii) Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance (each, an Extraordinary Advance shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, except that no Extraordinary Advance shall be eligible to be a SOFR Loan. Prior to Settlement of any Extraordinary Advance, all payments with respect thereto, including interest thereon, shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account. Each Revolving Lender shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided in Section 2.3(e) (or Section 2.3(g) , as applicable) for the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Extraordinary Advance. The Extraordinary Advances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Agent s Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. The provisions of this Section 2.3(d) are for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers (or any other Loan Party) in any way. 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, (A) no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause the aggregate principal amount of Extraordinary Advances outstanding to exceed an amount equal to the greater of 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and 57,500,000, and (B) no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or any Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Usage to exceed such Lender s Revolver Commitments; provided that Agent may make Extraordinary Advances in excess of the limitation set forth in the preceding clause (B) (but subject to the other limitations set forth in this Section 2.3(d) so long as such Extraordinary Advances that cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or a Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Usage to exceed such Lender s Revolver Commitments are for Agent s sole and separate account and not for the account of any Lender. No Lender shall have an obligation to settle with Agent for such Extraordinary Advances that cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or a Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Usage to exceed such Lender s Revolver Commitments as provided in Section 2.3(e) (or Section 2.3(g) , as applicable). 

(e) Settlement . It is agreed that each Lender s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the 

51 

outstanding Revolving Loans. Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions: 

(i) Agent shall request settlement Settlement with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent in its sole discretion (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (2) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Extraordinary Advances, and (3) with respect to any Loan Party s or any of their Subsidiaries payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the Settlement Date ). Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) for the period since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.3(g) ): (y) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender exceeds such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. noon on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances), and (z) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender is less than such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. noon on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to Agent s Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances). Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances and, together with the portion of such Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances representing Swing Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders. If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate. 

(ii) In determining whether a Lender s balance of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral. 

(iii) Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to 

52 

the Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans. Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Swing Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date, payments or other amounts of the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the provisions of Section 2.3(g) ), to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Extraordinary Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable. 

(iv) Anything in this Section 2.3(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall be entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(g) . 

(f) Notation . Consistent with Section 13.1(h) , Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the principal amount and stated interest of the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to Swing Lender, and Extraordinary Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of each Lender, from time to time and such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate. 

(g) Defaulting Lenders . 

(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(iii) , Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lender s benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments (A) first , to Agent to the extent of any Extraordinary Advances that were made by Agent and that were required to be, but were not, paid by Defaulting Lender, (B) second , to Swing Lender to the extent of any Swing Loans that were made by Swing Lender and that were required to be, but were not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (C) third , to Issuing Bank, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (D) fourth , to each Non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender s portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (E) fifth , in Agent s sole discretion, to a suspense account maintained by Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers (upon the request of Borrowers and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations) hereunder, and (F) sixth , from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (M) of Section 2.4(b)(iii) . Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of 

53 

all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section 2.10(b) , such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and such Lender s Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided , that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters governed by Section 14.1(a)(i) through (iii) . The provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Bank, and Borrowers shall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.3(g) to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) shall be released to Borrowers). The operation of this Section 2.3(g) shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Bank, or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any failure by a Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be reasonably acceptable to Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of its participation in the Letters of Credit); provided , that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups or Borrowers rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund. In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.3(g) and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall control and govern. 

(ii) If any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time that a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 

(A) such Defaulting Lender s Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of Revolver Usage plus such Defaulting Lender s Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolver Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied at such time;

(C) if Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) , Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(b) with respect to such cash collateralized portion of such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized; 

(D) to the extent the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) , then the Letter of Credit Fees payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure; 

(E) to the extent any Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) , then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees that would have otherwise been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.6(b) with respect to such portion of such Letter of Credit Exposure shall instead be payable to Issuing Bank until such portion of such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized or reallocated; 

(F) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Lender shall not be required to make any Swing Loan and Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, in each case, to the extent (x) the Defaulting Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Swing Loans or Letter of Credit cannot be reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) , or (y) the Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, and Borrowers to eliminate the Swing Lender s or Issuing Bank s risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender s participation in Swing Loans or Letters of Credit; and 

(G) Agent may release any cash collateral provided by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) to Issuing Bank and Issuing Bank may apply any such cash collateral to the payment of such Defaulting Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement that is not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.11(d) . Subject to Section 17.14 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 

(h) Independent Obligations . All Revolving Loans (other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other 

55 

Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

Issuing Bank s records of the content of any such request will be conclusive. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Issuing Bank may, but shall not be obligated to, issue a Letter of Credit that supports the obligations of a Loan Party or one of its Subsidiaries in respect of x) a lease of real property, or (y) an employment contract. 

(b) No Issuing Bank shall have any obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested issuance: 

(i) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or 

(ii) the Letter of Credit Usage related to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank would exceed the Issuing Bank Sublimit of such Issuing Bank, or 

(iii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount less the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans), or 

63 

(iv) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base at such time less the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans (inclusive of Swing Loans) at such time. 

(c) In the event there is a Defaulting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent (i) the Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Letter of Credit may not be reallocated pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) , or (ii) Issuing Bank has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and Borrowers to eliminate Issuing Bank s risk with respect to the participation in such Letter of Credit of the Defaulting Lender, which arrangements may include Borrowers cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure in accordance with Section 2.3(g)(ii) . Additionally, Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue or extend a Letter of Credit if (A) any order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall, by its terms, purport to enjoin or restrain Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request that Issuing Bank refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally, or (C) if amounts demanded to be paid under any Letter of Credit will not or may not be in United States Dollars. 

(d) Any Issuing Bank (other than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall notify Agent in writing no later than the Business Day prior to the Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues any Letter of Credit. In addition, each Issuing Bank (other than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall, on the first Business Day of each week, submit to Agent a report detailing the daily undrawn amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the prior calendar week. Borrowers and the Lender Group hereby acknowledge and agree that all Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute Letters of Credit under this Agreement on and after the Closing Date with the same effect as if such Existing Letters of Credit were issued by Issuing Bank at the request of Borrowers on the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Issuing Bank, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars. If Issuing Bank makes a payment under a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement on the Business Day such Letter of Credit Disbursement is made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of Credit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder (notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in Section 3 and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. If a Letter of Credit Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, Borrowers obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement to Issuing Bank shall be automatically converted into an obligation to pay the resulting Revolving Loan. Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) , Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.11(e) to reimburse Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. 

(e) Promptly following receipt of a notice of a Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.11(d) , each Revolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to Section 2.11(d) on the same terms and conditions as if Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment, renewal, or extension of a Letter of Credit) and without any further action on the part of Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit 

64 

issued by Issuing Bank, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit, and each such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank under the applicable Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in Section 2.11(d) , or of any reimbursement payment that is required to be refunded (or that Agent or Issuing Bank elects, based upon the advice of counsel, to refund) to Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, an amount equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 3 . If any such Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender s Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit Disbursement as provided in this this Section 2.11 , such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account of Issuing Bank) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate until paid in full. 

(f) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Lender Group (including Issuing Bank and its branches, Affiliates, and correspondents) and each such Person s respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents (each, including Issuing Bank, a Letter of Credit Related Person (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), which may be incurred by or awarded against any such Letter of Credit Related Person (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16 (the Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs ), and which arise out of or in connection with, or as a result of: 

(i) any Letter of Credit or any pre-advice of its issuance; 

(ii) any transfer, sale, delivery, surrender or endorsement (or lack thereof) of any Drawing Document at any time(s) held by any such Letter of Credit Related Person in connection with any Letter of Credit; 

(iii) any action or proceeding arising out of, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit (whether administrative, judicial or in connection with arbitration), including any action or proceeding to compel or restrain any presentation or payment under any Letter of Credit, or for the wrongful dishonor of, or honoring a presentation under, any Letter of Credit; 

(iv) any independent undertakings issued by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit; 

(v) any unauthorized instruction or request made to Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit, or any error, omission, interruption or delay in such instruction or request, whether transmitted by mail, courier, electronic transmission, SWIFT, or any other telecommunication including communications through a correspondent; 

65 

(vi) an adviser, confirmer or other nominated person seeking to be reimbursed, indemnified or compensated; 

(vii) any third party seeking to enforce the rights of an applicant, beneficiary, nominated person, transferee, assignee of Letter of Credit proceeds or holder of an instrument or document; 

(viii) the fraud, forgery or illegal action of parties other than the Letter of Credit Related Person; 

(ix) any prohibition on payment of any amount payable by Issuing Bank to a beneficiary or transferee beneficiary of a Letter of Credit arising out of Anti-Corruption Laws, Anti-Money Laundering Laws, or Sanctions; 

(x) Issuing Bank s performance of the obligations of a confirming institution or entity that wrongfully dishonors a confirmation; 

(xi) any foreign language translation provided to Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit; 

(xii) any foreign law or usage as it relates to Issuing Bank s issuance of a Letter of Credit in support of a foreign guaranty including the expiration of such guaranty after the related Letter of Credit expiration date and any resulting drawing paid by Issuing Bank in connection therewith; or 

(xiii) the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto governmental or regulatory authority or cause or event beyond the control of the Letter of Credit Related Person; 

provided , that such indemnity shall not be available to any Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnification under clauses (i) through (xiii) above to the extent that such Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity. Borrowers hereby agree to pay the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity on demand from time to time all amounts owing under this Section 2.11(f) . If and to the extent that the obligations of Borrowers under this Section 2.11(f) are unenforceable for any reason, Borrowers agree to make the maximum contribution to the Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs permissible under applicable law. This indemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all Letters of Credit. 
 (g) The liability of Issuing Bank (or any other Letter of Credit Related Person) under, in connection with or arising out of any Letter of Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages suffered by Borrowers that are caused directly by Issuing Bank s gross negligence or willful misconduct in (i) honoring a presentation under a Letter of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing to honor a presentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or (iii) retaining Drawing Documents presented under a Letter of Credit. Borrowers aggregate remedies against Issuing Bank and any Letter of Credit Related Person for wrongfully honoring a presentation under any Letter of Credit or wrongfully retaining honored Drawing Documents shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount paid by Borrowers to Issuing Bank in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under Section 2.11(d) , plus interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder. Borrowers shall take action to avoid 

66 

and mitigate the amount of any damages claimed against Issuing Bank or any other Letter of Credit Related Person, including by enforcing its rights against the beneficiaries of the Letters of Credit. Any claim by Borrowers under or in connection with any Letter of Credit shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount (if any) saved by Borrowers as a result of the breach or alleged wrongful conduct complained of, and (y) the amount (if any) of the loss that would have been avoided had Borrowers taken all reasonable steps to mitigate any loss, and in case of a claim of wrongful dishonor, by specifically and timely authorizing Issuing Bank to effect a cure. 

(h) Borrowers are responsible for the final text of the Letter of Credit as issued by Issuing Bank, irrespective of any assistance Issuing Bank may provide such as drafting or recommending text or by Issuing Bank s use or refusal to use text submitted by Borrowers. Borrowers understand that the final form of any Letter of Credit may be subject to such revisions and changes as are deemed necessary or appropriate by Issuing Bank, and Borrowers hereby consent to such revisions and changes not materially different from the application executed in connection therewith. Borrowers are solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit for Borrowers purposes. If Borrowers request Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit for an affiliated or unaffiliated third party (an Account Party ), (i) such Account Party shall have no rights against Issuing Bank; (ii) Borrowers shall be responsible for the application and obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) communications (including notices) related to the respective Letter of Credit shall be among Issuing Bank and Borrowers. Borrowers will examine the copy of the Letter of Credit and any other documents sent by Issuing Bank in connection therewith and shall promptly notify Issuing Bank (not later than three (3) Business Days following Borrowers receipt of documents from Issuing Bank) of any non-compliance with Borrowers instructions and of any discrepancy in any document under any presentment or other irregularity. Borrowers understand and agree that Issuing Bank is not required to extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit for any reason. With respect to any Letter of Credit containing an automatic amendment to extend the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, may give notice of nonrenewal of such Letter of Credit and, if Borrowers do not at any time want the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be extended, Borrowers will so notify Agent and Issuing Bank at least 30 calendar days before Issuing Bank is required to notify the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any advising bank of such non-extension pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit. 

(i) Borrowers reimbursement and payment obligations under this Section 2.11 are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including: 

(i) any lack of validity, enforceability or legal effect of any Letter of Credit, any Issuer Document, this Agreement, or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein or herein; 

(ii) payment against presentation of any draft, demand or claim for payment under any Drawing Document that does not comply in whole or in part with the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit or which proves to be fraudulent, forged or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or which is signed, issued or presented by a Person or a transferee of such Person purporting to be a successor or transferee of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit; 

(iii) Issuing Bank or any of its branches or Affiliates being the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit; 

67

(v) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against any beneficiary or transferee beneficiary, any assignee of proceeds, Issuing Bank or any other Person; 

(vi) Issuing Bank or any correspondent honoring a drawing upon receipt of an electronic presentation under a Letter of Credit requiring the same, regardless of whether the original Drawing Documents arrive at Issuing Bank s counters or are different from the electronic presentation; 

(vii) any other event, circumstance or conduct whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing that might, but for this Section 2.11(i) , constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against, any Borrower s or any of its Subsidiaries reimbursement and other payment obligations and liabilities, arising under, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit, whether against Issuing Bank, the beneficiary or any other Person; or 

(viii) the fact that any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 

provided , that subject to Section 2.11(f) above, the foregoing shall not release Issuing Bank from such liability to Borrowers as may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction against Issuing Bank following reimbursement or payment of the obligations and liabilities, including reimbursement and other payment obligations, of Borrowers to Issuing Bank arising under, or in connection with, this Section 2.11 or any Letter of Credit. 
 (j) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Issuing Bank and each other Letter of Credit Related Person (if applicable) shall not be responsible to Borrowers for, and Issuing Bank s rights and remedies against Borrowers and the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit shall not be impaired by: 

(i) honor of a presentation under any Letter of Credit that on its face substantially complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, even if the Letter of Credit requires strict compliance by the beneficiary;

(v) acting upon any instruction or request relative to a Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit that Issuing Bank in good faith believes to have been given by a Person authorized to give such instruction or request;

(xiii) honor of a presentation that is subsequently determined by Issuing Bank to have been made in violation of international, federal, state or local restrictions on the transaction of business with certain prohibited Persons. 

(k) Borrowers shall pay immediately upon demand to Agent for the account of Issuing Bank as non-refundable fees, commissions, and charges (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such fees, commissions, and charges to the Loan Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this Section 2.11(k)) : (i) a fronting fee which shall be imposed by Issuing Bank equal to 0.125 per annum multiplied by the average amount of the Letter of Credit Usage during the immediately preceding month, plus (ii) any and all other customary commissions, fees and charges then in effect imposed by, and any and all expenses incurred by, Issuing Bank, or by any adviser, confirming institution or entity or other nominated person, relating to Letters of Credit, at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit and upon the occurrence of any 

69 

other activity with respect to any Letter of Credit (including transfers, assignments of proceeds, amendments, drawings, renewals or cancellations). 

(l) If by reason of (x) any Change in Law, or (y) compliance by Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the Board of Governors as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto): 

(i) any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or any Loans or obligations to make Loans hereunder or hereby, or 

(ii) there shall be imposed on Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit, Loans, or obligations to make Loans hereunder, and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost to Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group of issuing, making, participating in, or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall pay within 30 days after demand therefor, such amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder; provided , that (A) Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11(l) for any such amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to Borrowers, and (B) if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.11(l) , as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

(o) Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Issuing Bank and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the 

70 

rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

Each Borrower irrevocably appoints Issuing Bank as its attorney-in-fact and authorizes Issuing Bank, without notice to Borrowers, to execute and deliver ancillary documents and letters customary in the letter of credit business that may include but are not limited to advisements, indemnities, checks, bills of exchange and issuance documents. The power of attorney granted by the Borrowers is limited solely to such actions related to the issuance, confirmation or amendment of any Letter of Credit and to ancillary documents or letters customary in the letter of credit business. This appointment is coupled with an interest. 

2.12 SOFR Option . 

(a) Interest and Interest Payment Dates . In lieu of having interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrowers shall have the option, subject to Section 2.12(b) below (the SOFR Option to have interest on all or a portion of the Revolving Loans be charged (whether at the time when made (unless otherwise provided herein), upon conversion from a Base Rate Loan to a SOFR Loan, or upon continuation of a SOFR Loan as a SOFR Loan) at a rate of interest based upon Adjusted Term SOFR. Interest on SOFR Loans shall be payable on the earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the date on which all or any portion of the Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms hereof, or (iii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. On the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless Borrowers have properly exercised the SOFR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such SOFR Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the written election of Agent or the Required Lenders, Borrowers no longer shall have the option to request that Revolving Loans bear interest at a rate based upon Adjusted Term SOFR. 

(b) SOFR Election . 

(i) Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, so long as Borrowers have not received a notice from Agent (which notice Agent may elect to give or 

71 

not give in its discretion unless Agent is directed to give such notice by the Required Lenders, in which case, it shall give the notice to Borrowers), after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to terminate the right of Borrowers to exercise the SOFR Option during the continuance of such Event of Default, elect to exercise the SOFR Option by notifying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the commencement of the proposed Interest Period (the SOFR Deadline ). Notice of Borrowers election of the SOFR Option for a permitted portion of the Revolving Loans and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by delivery to Agent of a SOFR Notice received by Agent before the SOFR Deadline. Promptly upon its receipt of each such SOFR Notice, Agent shall provide a notice thereof to each of the affected Lenders. 

(ii) Each SOFR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers. In connection with each SOFR Loan, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost, or expense actually incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (A) the payment or required assignment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (B) the conversion of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (C) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any SOFR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, or expenses, Funding Losses ). A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered to Borrowers setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent or the Lender, as applicable, within 30 days of the date of its receipt of such certificate. If a payment of a SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period would result in a Funding Loss, Agent may, in its sole discretion at the request of Borrowers, hold the amount of such payment as cash collateral in support of the Obligations until the last day of such Interest Period and apply such amounts to the payment of the applicable SOFR Loan on such last day of such Interest Period, it being agreed that Agent has no obligation to so defer the application of payments to any SOFR Loan and that, in the event that Agent does not defer such application, Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any resulting Funding Losses. 

(iii) Unless Agent, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise, Borrowers shall have not more than 10 SOFR Loans in effect at any given time. Borrowers may only exercise the SOFR Option for proposed SOFR Loans of at least 1,000,000. 

(c) Conversion; Prepayment . Borrowers may convert SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans or prepay SOFR Loans at any time; provided , that in the event that SOFR Loans are converted or prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any prepayment through the required application by Agent of any payments or proceeds of Collateral in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders and their Participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12(b)(ii) . 

(d) Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted Term SOFR . 

(i) Adjusted Term SOFR may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs (other than Taxes which shall be governed by Section 16 ), in each case, due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, or 

72 

pursuant to any Change in Law or change in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans bearing interest at Adjusted Term SOFR. In any such event, the affected Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Borrowers may, by notice to such affected Lender (A) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for adjusting Adjusted Term SOFR and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case, of such Lender with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.12(b)(ii) ). 

(ii) Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.12(d)(iii) below, in the event that any change in market conditions or any Change in Law shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR) or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR or SOFR, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Agent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (y)(i) in the case of any SOFR Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, such SOFR Loans of such Lender will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period of such SOFR Loans, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans, and thereafter interest upon the SOFR Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans (if applicable, without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof) and (ii) in the case of any such Base Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding and that are determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR, interest upon the Base Rate Loans of such Lender after the date specified in such Lender s notice shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the SOFR Option and Base Rate Loans shall not be determined with reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof, in each case, until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so. 

(iii) Benchmark Replacement Setting. 

(A) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Agent and Administrative Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth(5 th Business Day after Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and Administrative Borrower so long as Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 

(B) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes .

Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii) , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii) . 

(D) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (1) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (I) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Agent in its reasonable discretion or (II) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (2) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (1) above either (I) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (II) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 

(E) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon Administrative Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (1) Administrative Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, Administrative Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans and (2) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. 

(e) No Requirement of Matched Funding . Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at Adjusted Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Reference Rate.

2.13 Capital Requirements . 

(a) If, after the date hereof, Issuing Bank or any Lender determines that (i) any Change in Law regarding capital, liquidity or reserve requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or (ii) compliance by Issuing Bank or such Lender, or their respective parent bank holding companies, with any guideline, request or directive of any Governmental Authority regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on Issuing Bank s, such Lender s, or such holding companies capital or liquidity as a consequence of Issuing Bank s or such Lender s commitments, Loans, participations or other obligations hereunder to a level below that which Issuing Bank, such Lender, or such holding companies could have achieved but for such Change in Law or compliance (taking into consideration Issuing Bank s, such Lender s, or such holding companies then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements and assuming the full utilization of such entity s capital) by any amount deemed by Issuing Bank or such Lender to be material, then Issuing Bank or such Lender may notify Borrowers and Agent thereof. Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay Issuing Bank or such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable within 30 days after presentation by Issuing Bank or such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail Issuing Bank s or such Lender s calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error). In determining such amount, Issuing Bank or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure or delay on the part of Issuing Bank or any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall not constitute a waiver of Issuing Bank s or such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided , that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Issuing Bank or a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 for any reductions in return incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that Issuing Bank or such Lender notifies Borrowers of such Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further , that if such claim arises by reason of the Change in Law that is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 

(b) If Issuing Bank or any Lender requests additional or increased costs referred to in Section 2.11(l) or Section 2.12(d)(i) or amounts under Section 2.13(a) or sends a notice under Section 2.12(d)(ii) relative to changed circumstances (such Issuing Bank or Lender, an Affected Lender ), then, at the request of Administrative Borrower, such Affected Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly designate a different one of its lending offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches, if (i) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11(l) , Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a) , as applicable, or would eliminate the illegality or impracticality of funding or maintaining SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR), and (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would not subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to it. Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. If, after such reasonable efforts, such Affected Lender does not so designate a different one of its lending offices or assign its rights to another of its offices or branches so as to eliminate Borrowers obligation to pay any future amounts to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(l) , Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a) , as applicable, or to enable Borrowers to obtain SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR), then Borrowers (without prejudice to any amounts then due to such Affected Lender under Section 2.11(l) , Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a) , as applicable) may, unless prior to the effective date of any such assignment the Affected Lender withdraws its request for such additional amounts under Section 2.11(l) , Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a) , as applicable, or indicates that it is no longer unlawful or impractical to fund or maintain SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR), 

75 

may designate a different Issuing Bank or substitute a Lender or prospective Lender, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Agent to purchase the Obligations owed to such Affected Lender and such Affected Lender s commitments hereunder (a Replacement Lender ), and if such Replacement Lender agrees to such purchase, such Affected Lender shall assign to the Replacement Lender its Obligations and commitments, and upon such purchase by the Replacement Lender, which such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be Issuing Bank or a Lender (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be Issuing Bank or a Lender (as the case may be) for purposes of this Agreement. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the protection of Sections 2.11(l) , 2.12(d) , and 2.13 shall be available to Issuing Bank and each Lender (as applicable) regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, judicial ruling, judgment, guideline, treaty or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed, so long as it shall be customary for issuing banks or lenders affected thereby to comply therewith. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of Issuing Bank or such Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any.

In no event may the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount be increased pursuant to this Section 2.14 on more than two occasions in the aggregate for all such Increases. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Increases to the Revolver Commitments exceed 200,000,000. 

(b) Each of the following shall be conditions precedent to any Increase of the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount in connection therewith:

(v) Borrowers have delivered to Agent an officer s certificate with corresponding calculations certifying and demonstrating that as of the date of such Increase (i) after taking into account all Indebtedness of the Borrowers other than the Obligations, the Borrowers are able to incur Indebtedness under this Agreement equal to the Maximum Revolver Amount after giving effect to such Increase without violating Section 1011 of the KAC Indentures, and (ii) the Indenture Credit Facilities Cap exceeds the sum of (x) the Maximum Revolver Amount after giving effect to such Increase and (y) all Indenture Credit Facilities Indebtedness other than the Obligations, by an amount equal to or greater than 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount after giving effect to such Increase; and 

(vi) the interest rate margins with respect to the Revolving Loans to be made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments shall be the same as the interest rate margin applicable to Revolving Loans hereunder immediately prior to the applicable Increase Date (as defined below). 

(c) Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to Revolving Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include Revolving Loans made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments and Maximum Revolver Amount pursuant to this Section 2.14 . 

(d) Each of the Lenders having a Revolver Commitment prior to the Increase Date (the Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders shall assign to any Lender which is acquiring a new or additional Revolver Commitment on the Increase Date (the Post-Increase Revolver Lenders ), and such Post-Increase Revolver Lenders shall purchase from each Pre-Increase Revolver Lender, at the principal amount thereof, such interests in the Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit on such Increase Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit will be held by Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders and Post-Increase Revolver Lenders ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such increased Revolver Commitments.

Accordingly, each Borrower hereby waives any and all suretyship defenses that would otherwise be available to such Borrower under applicable law. 

(c) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration, or otherwise, or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligations until such time as all of the Obligations are paid in full, and without the need for demand, protest, or any other notice or formality. 

(d) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement (other than this Section 2.15(d) or any other circumstances whatsoever.

Each Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep informed of Borrowers financial condition and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations. 

(g) The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the benefit of Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each Bank Product Provider, and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy.

If any amount shall be paid to any Borrower in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to be credited and applied to the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Agreement, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as Collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this Agreement thereafter arising. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Borrower may exercise any rights of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights against, and may not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any property or asset of, any other Borrower (the Foreclosed Borrower ), including after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an exercise of remedies in respect of the Equity Interests of such Foreclosed Borrower whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. 

(i) Each of the Borrowers hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, the Borrowers shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing such Borrower s right to proceed against any other Loan Party. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, each of the Borrowers hereby waives until such time as the Obligations have been paid in full: 

(i) all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to the Borrowers by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899, and 3433 of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction; 

(ii) all rights and defenses that the Borrowers may have because the Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers may collect from the Borrowers without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral 

80 

pledged by any Loan Party, and (B) if Agent, on behalf of the Lender Group, forecloses on any Real Property pledged as Collateral by any Loan Party, (1) the amount of the Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Lender Group may collect from the Loan Parties even if, by foreclosing on any such Real Property pledged as Collateral, Agent or the other members of the Lender Group have destroyed or impaired any right the Borrowers may have to collect from any other Loan Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Borrowers may have because the Obligations are secured by Real Property (including any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction); and 

(iii) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank Product Providers, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Obligations, has destroyed the Borrowers rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other Loan Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction or otherwise

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

No Agent-Related Person shall have any liability to any Lender, and Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates if any request for a Loan, Letter of Credit or other extension of credit was not authorized by the applicable Borrower. Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose it to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law or regulation. 

15.4 Reliance by Agent . Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers or counsel to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent.

Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest, fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders and, except with respect to Events of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default, and stating that such notice is a notice of default. Agent promptly will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge. If any Lender obtains actual knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default. Each Lender shall be solely responsible for giving any notices to its Participants, if any. Subject to Section 15.4 , Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9 ; provided , that unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable.

(c) If a Lender or Participant claims an exemption from withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than the United States, such Lender or such Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrowers, to deliver to Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its first payment under this Agreement, but only if such Lender or such Participant is legally able to deliver such forms, or the providing of or delivery of such forms in the Lender s reasonable judgment would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender (or its Affiliates); provided , further , that nothing in this Section 16.2(c) shall require a Lender or Participant to disclose any information that it deems to be 

130 

confidential (including its tax returns). Each Lender and each Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. 

(d) If a Lender or Participant claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender or Participant sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant, such Lender or Participant agrees to notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a sale of a participation interest, to the Lender granting the participation only) of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant. To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent and Administrative Borrower will treat such Lender s or such Participant s documentation provided pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) as no longer valid. With respect to such percentage amount, such Participant or Assignee may provide new documentation, pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) , if applicable. Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 16 with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the Obligations so long as such Participant complies with the obligations set forth in this Section 16 with respect thereto. 

(e) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable due diligence and reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the IRC, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the IRC) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) as may be necessary for Agent or Borrowers to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 16.2(e) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

16.3 Reductions . 

(a) If a Lender or a Participant is subject to an applicable withholding tax, Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any payment to such Lender or such Participant an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax. If the forms or other documentation required by Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax. 

(b) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the participation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and 

131 

hold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this Section 16 , together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses). The obligation of the Lenders and the Participants under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent. 

16.4 Refunds . If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes to which the Loan Parties have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16 , so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, it shall pay over such refund to the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Loan Parties (but only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 16 with respect to Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such a refund); provided , that the Loan Parties, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Parties (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest or other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent or Lender hereunder as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 16 shall not be construed to require Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information which it deems confidential) to Loan Parties or any other Person or require Agent or any Lender to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to Section 16.4 , the payment of which would place Agent or such Lender (or their Affiliates) in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. 

17. GENERAL PROVISIONS . 

17.1 Effectiveness . This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by each Borrower, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages hereof. 

17.2 Section Headings . Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement. 

17.3 Interpretation . Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender Group or any Borrower, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto. 

17.4 Severability of Provisions . Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision. 

17.5 Bank Product Providers . Each Bank Product Provider in its capacity as such shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes 

132 

of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting. Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents. It is understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of each Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider s being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not. In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution. Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the applicable Bank Product Provider. In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof). Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although Borrowers are not required to do so. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors. 

17.6 Debtor-Creditor Relationship . The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor. No member of the Lender Group has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein. 

17.7 Counterparts; Electronic Execution . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Execution of any such counterpart may be by means of (a) an electronic signature that complies with the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as in effect from time to time, state enactments of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as in effect from time to time, or any other relevant and applicable electronic signatures law; (b) an original manual signature; or (c) a faxed, scanned, or photocopied manual signature. Each electronic signature or faxed, scanned, or photocopied manual signature shall for all purposes have the same validity, legal effect, and admissibility in evidence as an original manual signature. Agent reserves the right, in its discretion, to accept, deny, or condition acceptance of any electronic signature on this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed 

133 

counterpart of this Agreement by faxed, scanned or photocopied manual signature shall also deliver an original manually executed counterpart, but the failure to deliver an original manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability and binding effect of this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document, and any notice delivered hereunder or thereunder, mutatis mutandis . 

17.8 Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations; Certain Waivers . 

(a) If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document or any Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a Voidable Transfer ), or because such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider related thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist, and (ii) Agent s Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and remain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A) Agent s Liens shall have been released or terminated, or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent s Liens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral securing such liability. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations. 

(b) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, if Agent or any Lender accepts a guaranty of only a portion of the Obligations pursuant to any guaranty, each Borrower hereby waives its right under Section 2822(a) of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction to designate the portion of the Obligations satisfied by the applicable guarantor s partial payment.

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
