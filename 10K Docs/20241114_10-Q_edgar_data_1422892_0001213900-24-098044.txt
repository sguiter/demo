to Singularity Future Technology Ltd. to reflect its expanded operations into the digital assets business. Currently, we primarily focus
on providing freight logistics services, which mainly include shipping, warehouse services and other logistical support to steel companies. 

In 2017, we began exploring
new opportunities to expand our business and generate more revenue. These opportunities ranged from complementary businesses to other
new service and product initiatives. In the fiscal year 2022, while we continued to provide our traditional freight logistics business,
we expanded our services to include warehousing services provided by our U.S. subsidiary Brilliant Warehouse Service Inc. 

We are currently operating through our subsidiary
Trans Pacific Shipping Limited. As of July 31, 2024, we have terminated the operations of our subsidiaries Gorgeous Trading Ltd. and Brilliant

no material operations, conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries established in the United States, the People s
Republic of China (the PRC or China and Hong Kong. However, neither the holding company nor any of the Company s
Chinese subsidiaries conduct any operations through contractual arrangements with a variable interest entity based in China. Investors
in our common stock should be aware that they may never directly hold equity interests in the PRC operating entities, but rather equity
interests solely in Singularity, our Virginia holding company. Furthermore, shareholders may face difficulties enforcing their legal rights
under United States securities laws against our directors and officers who are located outside of the United States. 

Recent Developments 

We are currently exploring
new business opportunities while continuing to provide freight logistics services. On September 19, 2023, the Company formed a 100 owned

Services Corp., a Wyoming corporation, to establish a joint venture to carry out the Solar Panel Business. 

The Company decided to develop
the Solar Panel Business based on its insight into the broad prospects of new energy. In the decision-making process, the needs of environmental
protection and market potential were fully considered. This new Solar Panel Business complements our existing businesses and will expand
the company s sustainable development.

COVID-19 

The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus COVID-19 starting from late January 2020 in the PRC has spread rapidly to many parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization
declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the continually expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and U.S., our business, results
of operations, and financial condition are still adversely affected. The situation remains highly uncertain for any further outbreak or
resurgence of COVID-19. It is therefore difficult for us to estimate the impact on our business or operating results that might be adversely
affected by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19. 

In early December 2022, the Chinese government
eased its strict control measures for COVID-19, which led to a surge in increased infections and disruptions in our business operations.
Any future impact of COVID-19 on the Company s China operational results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments
and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and resurgence of COVID-19 variants and the actions taken by government authorities
to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. 

The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Due to travel restrictions between US and China, our joint ventures were unable to start operation as planned which has slowed down our new business development. 

Our sales of crypto mining machines were materially adversely affected by COVID-19. Specifically, Crypto mining machine manufacturers have been impacted by the constrained supply of the semiconductors used in the production of the highly specialized crypto mining machines; COVID-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in delayed shipments and additional expenses to expedite delivery; as a result, we were unable to fulfil our customer orders on a timely basis, resulting cancellation of orders and partial refund of purchase price, as evident from the settlement in SOSNY. 

Although the impact of COVID-19 on our operations
decreased in 2023, such impact still exists and may continue to exist for an unforeseeable period of time. The impact of any future spread
of COVID-19 on the Company s China operation will depend, to a large extent, on the duration and resurgence of COVID-19 variants
and the actions taken by government authorities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which is beyond our control.

Revenues decreased by 394,524,
or approximately 44.0 , to 501,402 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 895,926 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
was mainly caused by shipping revenue decline from our U.S. subsidiary, Brilliant Warehouse, in 195,270 and from our PRC subsidiaries
in 199,254 due to the business volume reduce. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues for our freight
logistics services segment mainly consisted of freight costs to various freight carriers, cost of labor, warehouse rent and other overhead
and sundry costs. Cost of revenues for our freight logistics services segment was 773,317 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
a de crease of 229,632, or approximately 22.9 , as compared to 1,002,949
for the same period in 2023. The decrease was in line with the decline in revenue. 

Our gross margin was (54.2 and (11.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease in gross margin was mainly due to decreased
revenue from our freight logistics business. 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Operating costs and expenses decreased by 1,706,898
or approximately 52.8 from 1,526,854 for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,233,752 for the same period in 2023.
This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses, impairment loss of Cryptocurrencies and provision
for doubtful accounts as more fully discussed below. 

Selling Expenses 

Our selling expenses consisted
primarily of salaries, meals and entertainment and travel expenses for our sales representatives. For the three months ended September
30, 2024, we had 62,981 in selling expenses, as compared to 55,853 for the same period in 2023, which represents an increase of 7,128
or approximately 12.8 . The increase was mainly due to an increase in salaries as we added to employees and incurred increased marketing
expenses for the freight logistics segment for our sales team. 

33 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits, travel expenses for our administration department, office expenses, and regulatory filing and professional
service fees for auditing, legal and IT consulting. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 690,556 of general and administrative
expenses, as compared to 2,054,153 for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 1,363,597, or approximately 66.4 . The decrease
was mainly due to the decreased professional fees of approximately 647,039 which are mainly included auditor fee, lawyer fee and consulting
fee. On the other hand, other employee expense was reduced by 541,343 due to the labor compensation of 500,000 was paid in the same
period of last year. 

Provision for doubtful accounts, net 

Our total bad debt expenses amounted to nil and
 48,618 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was mainly due to the bad debt provision in 50,000 for the deposit
of the early termination of the lease agreement in, Jericho, New York for the same period in 2023. 

Impairment Loss of Cryptocurrencies 

We recorded an impairment
of nil and 72,179 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, for the cryptocurrencies held by us as the ownership of the
cryptocurrencies could not be verified. 

Other Income(Expenses), Net 

Other income, net was 21,117 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, which mainly consisted of interest income of 38,484, compared to 21,917 of interest expenses and 56,042 of
exchange loss for the same period in 2023. 

Taxes 

We did not record any income tax expense for both
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The Company s operations in the U.S. incurred
cumulative U.S. federal net operation losses NOL of approximately 47,200,000 as of June 30, 2024, which may reduce
future federal taxable income. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 1,000,000 of NOL was generated and the
tax benefit derived from such NOL was approximately 210,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative NOL amounted to
approximately 48,200,000, which may reduce future federal taxable income. 

The Company s operations in China incurred
a cumulative NOL of approximately 2,062,000 as of June 30, 2024 which was mainly from net loss. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, additional NOL of approximately 55,000 was generated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative NOL amounted
to approximately which may reduce future taxable income which will expire by 2026. 

The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood
of the realization of deferred tax assets DTA and reduces the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation
allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. Management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that
could affect the Company s future realization of deferred tax assets including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation
of future income, the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The Company determined that
it is more likely than not its deferred tax assets could not be realized due to uncertainty on future earnings as a result of the Company s
reorganization and venture into new businesses. The Company provided a 100 allowance for its DTA as of September 30, 2024. The net
decrease in valuation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately 960,000, based on management s reassessment
of the amount of the Company s deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss
of 1,004,335 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 2,414,996 for the same period in 2023. After the
deduction of non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to us was 961,789 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 2,290,185 for the same period in 2023. Comprehensive loss attributable to us was 1,072,055 for the three months ended September 30,

In assessing the liquidity, we monitor and analyze
our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements,
operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of September 30, 2024, our working capital was approximately 11,891,475 and
we had cash of approximately 17,740,908 in cash (including cash on hand and cash in bank). We believe our current working capital is
sufficient to support our operations and debt obligations as they become due for the next twelve months. 

Operating Activities 

Our net cash used in operating activities was approximately
 9,145 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The operating cash outflow for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily
attributable to our net loss of approximately 1.0 million. We had an increase in accounts payable of approximately 585,260, and an increase
in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of approximately 666,166 offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately
 355,203. 

Our net cash used in operating activities was
approximately 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The operating cash outflow for the three months ended September
30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our net loss of approximately 2.4 million adjusted by non-cash lease expense of 0.1 million and
impairment loss of cryptocurrencies of 0.1 million.

We did not have any investing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was
approximately 0.05 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to repayments from related parties from Zhejiang Jinbang
Fuel Energy Co., Ltd Zhejiang Jinbang which is owned by Mr. Qinggang Wang. 

Financing Activities 

We did not have any financing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2023 was 5.4 million due to the repayment of 5 million of convertible notes and the accrued interest
of 403,424. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
reported. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 (describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of its management, including the Company s Chief Operating
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing
evaluation, the Chief Operating Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the applicable rules and forms due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting that stemmed from the following material
weaknesses: 

Lack of segregation of duties
for accounting personnel who prepared and reviewed the journal entries in some of the subsidiaries within the consolidation, lack of
supervision, coordination and communication of financial information between different entities within the Group; 

Lack of full time U.S. GAAP personnel
in the accounting department to monitor and reconcile the recording of the transactions which led to error in revenue recognition in
previously issued financial statements; 

Lack of resources with technical
competency to address, review and record non-routine or complex transactions under U.S. GAAP; 

Lack of management control reviews
of the budget against actual with analysis of the variance with a precision that can be explained through the analysis of the accounts; 

Lack of proper procedures in identifying
and recording related party transactions which led to restatement of previously issued financial statements; 

Lack of proper procedures to maintain
supporting documents for accounting records; and 

Lack of proper oversight for the
Company s cash disbursement process that led to misuse of the Company funds by its former executive. 

36 

In order to remediate the material weaknesses
stated above, we have hired external financial advisors and updated certain of our internal controls. We intend to implement additional
policies and procedures, which include: 

Hiring additional accounting staff
to report the internal financial timely; 

Reporting other material and non-routine
transactions to the Board and obtain proper approval; 

Recruiting additional qualified
professionals with appropriate levels of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to assist in resolving accounting issues in non-routine or
complex transactions; 

Developing and conducting U.S.
GAAP knowledge, SEC reporting and internal control training to senior executives, management personnel, accounting departments and the
IT staff, so that management and key personnel understand the requirements and elements of internal control over financial reporting
mandated by the U.S. securities laws; 

Setting up budgets and developing
expectations based on understanding of the business operations, compare the actual results with the expectations periodically and document
the reasons of the fluctuations with further analysis. This should be done by CFO and reviewed by CEO, communicated with the Board; 

Strengthening corporate governance; 

Setting up policies and procedures
for the Company s related party identification to properly identify, record and disclose related party transactions; and 

Setting up proper procedures for
the Company s fund disbursement process to ensure that cash is disbursed only upon proper authorization, for valid business purposes,
and that all disbursements are properly recorded. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

year ended June 30, 2021 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 29, 2021 (the 2021
Form 10-K should no longer be relied upon as a result of incorrect accounting treatment of approximately 4.6 million of related
party loan receivable. The audit committee also concluded that the financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2021 included in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (the 2021 Form 10-Qs, collectively
with the 2021 Form 10-K, the Affected Reports ), filed with the SEC on November 12, 2021 and February 14, 2022, respectively,

for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company corrected the errors referenced above
in an amendment to (1) the 2021 Form 10-K (the Amended Form 10-K and (2) each of the 2021 Form 10-Qs (the Amended

the Restatements (the Investigation ). Because the Investigation is at an early stage, the Company cannot predict its outcome,
duration, or any potential consequences at this time. The SEC has not advised the Company that it has concluded any legal violation has
