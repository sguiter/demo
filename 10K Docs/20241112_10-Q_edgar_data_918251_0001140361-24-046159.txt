GLOSSARY

The following terms are frequently used in the text of this report and have the meanings indicated below.

Used Core An automobile part which has previously been used in the operation of a vehicle. Generally, the Used Core is an original
 equipment OE automobile part installed by the vehicle manufacturer and subsequently removed for replacement. Used Cores contain salvageable parts, which are an important raw material in the remanufacturing process. We obtain most Used Cores by
 providing credits to our customers for Used Cores returned to us under our core exchange programs. Our customers receive these Used Cores from consumers who deliver a Used Core to obtain credit from our customers upon the purchase of a newly
 remanufactured automobile part. When sufficient Used Cores are not available from our customers, we purchase Used Cores from core brokers, who are in the business of buying and selling Used Cores. The Used Cores purchased from core brokers or
 returned to us by our customers under the core exchange programs, and which have been physically received by us, are part of our raw material and work-in-process inventory. Used Cores returned by consumers to our customers but not yet returned to
 us are classified as contract assets until we physically receive these Used Cores.

Remanufactured Core The Used Core underlying an automobile part that has gone through the remanufacturing process and through that process has become
 part of a newly remanufactured automobile part. The remanufacturing process takes a Used Core, breaks it down into its component parts, replaces those components that cannot be reused and reassembles the salvageable components of the Used Core and
 additional new components into a remanufactured automobile part. Remanufactured Cores held for sale at our customer locations are included in long-term contract assets. The Remanufactured Core portion of stock adjustment returns are classified as
 contract assets until we physically receive them.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.

The following summarizes certain key consolidated operating data:

Annualized finished goods turnover for the fiscal quarter is calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the quarter by 4 and dividing the result by the average between beginning and ending non-core finished goods inventory values
 for the fiscal quarter. We believe this provides a useful measure of our ability to turn our inventory into revenues.

Net Sales . Our consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 208,186,000, which represents an increase of 11,547,000, or 5.9 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023
 of 196,639,000. Our sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months September 30, 2023 reflect continued strong demand for rotating electrical and brake-related products.

Gross Profit. Our consolidated gross profit was 41,277,000, or 19.8 of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with
 41,148,000, or 20.9 of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in our gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects (i) 2,686,000 of certain one-time expenses for onboarding new
 business and (ii) 1,298,000 of transition expenses in connection with our on-going strategy to utilize our global footprint to enhance operating efficiencies. We expect to realize future benefit from this new business and cost-saving
 initiatives.

In addition, our gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by (i) amortization of core and finished goods premiums paid to customers
 related to new business of 2,621,000 and 2,707,000, respectively and (ii) the non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that are part of the finished goods on the customers shelves (which are included in
 contract assets) to the lower of cost or net realizable value, which resulted in a write-down of 1,164,000 and 1,995,000, respectively.

General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 15,052,000, which represents an increase of 727,000, or 5.1 , from the three months
 ended September 30, 2023 of 14,325,000. This increase was primarily due to the timing of certain expenses.

Sales and Marketing . Our sales and marketing expenses were consistent at 5,834,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 5,688,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Research and Development . Our research and development expenses were consistent at 2,443,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2,438,000 for the three months ended September
 30, 2023.

Foreign Exchange Impact of Lease Liabilities and Forward Contracts . Our foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts were non-cash losses of 5,428,000 and 4,760,000 for the three
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of our foreign
 currency-denominated lease liabilities, which resulted in non-cash losses of 3,978,000 and 1,948,000, respectively, due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) the forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which resulted in
 non-cash losses of 1,450,000 and 2,812,000, respectively, due to the changes in their fair values.

Operating Income

Consolidated Operating Income . Our consolidated operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 12,520,000 compared with 13,937,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This
 decrease was primarily due our foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts and other items as discussed above.

Interest Expense

Interest Expense, net. Our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 14,182,000, which represents a decrease of 1,201,000, or 7.8 , from interest
 expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 15,383,000. This decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances under our credit facility and lower interest rates. In addition, lower discount rates on accounts receivable
 discount programs was partially offset by increased collection of receivables utilizing these programs as a result of higher sales.

Change in Fair Value of Compound Net Derivative Liability

Change in Fair Value of Compound Net Derivative Liability. Our change in fair value of compound net derivative liability associated with the convertible notes issued on March 31,
 2023 was a non-cash loss of 380,000 and 390,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Our loss on extinguishment of debt was 168,000 in connection with the repayment of the remaining outstanding balance
 of our term loans during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Provision for Income Taxes

Income Tax . We recorded an income tax expense of 912,000, or an effective tax rate of (44.7) , compared with an income tax benefit of 46,000, or an effective tax rate of 2.3 ,
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily impacted by (i) the change in valuation allowance, (ii) specific jurisdictions that we do not
 expect to recognize the benefit of losses, and (iii) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the federal statutory rate.

Gross Profit. Our consolidated gross profit was 70,451,000, or 18.6 of consolidated net sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with
 67,715,000, or 19.0 of consolidated net sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was slightly reduced due to the following (i) 2,686,000 of certain one-time expenses for
 onboarding new business and (ii) 1,298,000 of transition expenses in connection with our on-going strategy to utilize our global footprint to enhance operating efficiencies. We expect to realize future benefit from this new business and
 cost-saving initiatives.

In addition, our gross margin for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the six months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by (i) amortization of core and finished goods premiums paid to customers

 ended September 30, 2023 of 26,927,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) 2,848,000 of increased severance during the six months ended September 30, 2024 due to headcount reductions in connection with our strategy to utilize our global
 footprint to enhance operating efficiencies and (ii) a loss of 1,726,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with a gain 155,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2023 resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.

 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of our foreign currency-denominated
 lease liabilities, which resulted in a non-cash loss of 9,687,000 compared with a non-cash gain of 1,822,000, respectively, due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) the forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which
 resulted in non-cash losses of 6,819,000 and 2,312,000, respectively, due to the changes in their fair values.

 the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily impacted by (i) the change in valuation allowance, (ii) specific jurisdictions that we do not expect
 to recognize the benefit of losses, and (iii) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the federal statutory rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of 154,260,000 and 156,034,000, a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.4:1.0, at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

In June 2024, we enrolled in a feature with our lenders, under which we sweep our cash collections to pay down our revolving facility and borrow on-demand to fund payments. This feature is expected to reduce interest expense on borrowings under
 the credit facility.

Our primary source of liquidity was from cash generated from operations, the use of our receivable discount programs, and credit facility during the six months ended September 30, 2024. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, use of receivable
 discount programs, amounts available under our credit facility, and other sources are sufficient to satisfy our expected future liquidity needs, including lease and capital expenditure obligations over the next 12 months.

Share Repurchase Program

In August 2018, our board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase program from 20,000,000 to 37,000,000 of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, 18,745,000 had been utilized and 18,255,000 remains available to
 repurchase shares under the authorized share repurchase program, subject to the limit in our credit facility. We retired the 837,007 shares repurchased under this program through September 30, 2024. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us
 to acquire any specific number of shares and shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions.

Net cash provided by operating activities was 2,011,000 compared with cash used in operating activities of 5,170,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The significant changes in our operating activities
 were due to our management of working capital, which included the reduction of inventory and increased collections of accounts receivable balances resulting from higher sales partially offset by the pay down of our accounts payable balances. Our
 accounts receivable balances were significantly higher in the prior year compared with the current year as we managed the use of accounts receivable discount programs in the prior year. We continue to manage our working capital to maximize our
 operating cash flow.

Net cash used in investing activities was 979,000 and 108,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in our investing activities primarily resulted from increased capital expenditures. 

Net cash used in financing activities was 4,365,000 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 4,008,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in our financing activities primarily
 resulted from net repayments in the current year compared with net borrowings in the prior year under our credit facility.

Capital Resources

Credit Facility

We have 268,620,000 in senior secured financing (as amended from time to time, the Credit Facility consisting of a 238,620,000 revolving loan facility (the Revolving Facility ), subject to certain restrictions, and a 30,000,000 term loan
 facility (the Term Loans ). The Term Loans were repaid during the year ended March 31, 2024. The Credit Facility matures on December 12, 2028. The lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets. In June 2024, we enrolled in a
 feature with our lenders, under which we sweep our cash collections to pay down our Revolving Facility and borrow on-demand to fund payments. This feature is expected to reduce interest expense on borrowings under the Credit Facility.

We had 124,691,000 and 128,000,000 outstanding under the Revolving Facility at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. In addition, 7,047,000 was outstanding for letters of credit at September 30,
 2024. At September 30, 2024, after certain contractual adjustments, 94,330,000 was available under the Revolving Facility. The interest rate on our Revolving Facility was 8.17 and 8.43 , at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024,
 respectively.

The Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if undrawn availability is less than 22.5 of the aggregate revolving commitments and a specified minimum undrawn availability. During the
 six months ended September 30, 2024, undrawn availability was greater than the 22.5 threshold, therefore, the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant was not required to be tested.

Convertible Notes

On March 31, 2023, we entered into a note purchase agreement, as amended, (the Note Purchase Agreement with Bison Capital Partners VI, L.P. and Bison Capital Partners VI-A, L.P. (collectively, the Purchasers and

 we may redeem all or part of the Convertible Notes for a cash purchase (the Company Redemption price. The effective interest rate was 18.3 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement, we entered into common stock warrants (the Warrants with the Purchasers, which mature on March 30, 2029. The fair value of the Warrants, using Level 3 inputs and the
 Monte Carlo simulation model, was zero at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.

The Company Redemption option has been combined with the Conversion Option as a compound net derivative liability (the Compound Net Derivative Liability ). The Compound Net Derivative Liability has been recorded within
 convertible note, related party in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The fair value of the Conversion Option and the Company Redemption option using Level 3 inputs and the Monte Carlo simulation

 390,000, respectively, as the change in fair value of the Compound Net Derivative Liability in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a gain of 2,200,000 and a loss
 of 530,000, respectively, as the change in fair value of the Compound Net Derivative Liability in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Convertible Notes also contain additional features, such as, default interest and options related to a fundamental transaction, which were not separately accounted for as the value of such features were not material
 at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.

Accounts Receivable Discount Programs

We use accounts receivable discount programs offered by certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, we have options to sell those customers receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the
 receivables are sold. These discount arrangements allow us to accelerate receipt of payment on customers receivables. While these arrangements have reduced our working capital needs, there can be no assurance that these programs will continue in
 the future. Interest expense resulting from these programs would increase if interest rates rise, if utilization of these discounting arrangements expands, if customers extend their payment to us, or if the discount period is extended to reflect
 more favorable payment terms to customers.

Supplier Finance Programs

We utilize a supplier finance program, which allows certain of our suppliers to sell their receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institutions. The program is
 administered by a third party. As of September 30, 2024, 15,000,000 of commitments from participating financial institutions is available to suppliers under this program. We have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct
 relationship with the financial institution. Payments to the third-party administrator are based on services rendered and are not related to the volume or number of financing agreements between suppliers, financial institution, and the third-party
 administrator. We are not a party to agreements negotiated between participating suppliers and the financial institution. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and payment terms, are not affected by a supplier's decision to
 participate in this program. We do not provide guarantees and there are no assets pledged to the financial institution or the third-party administrator for the committed payment in connection with this program. At September 30, 2024, we had
 26,487,000 of outstanding supplier obligations confirmed as valid under this program, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Capital Expenditures and Commitments

Capital Expenditures

Our total capital expenditures were 1,219,000 and 315,000 for six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These capital expenditures include (i) cash paid for the purchase of plant and equipment, (ii) equipment acquired under
 finance leases, and (iii) non-cash capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 primarily include the purchase of equipment for our current operations. We expect to incur approximately 5,000,000 of capital expenditures primarily to
 support our global growth initiatives and current operations during fiscal 2025. We have used and expect to continue using our working capital and additional capital lease obligations to finance these capital expenditures.

Related Party Transactions

Lease

In December 2022, we entered into an operating lease for our 35,000 square foot manufacturing, warehouse, and office facility in Ontario, Canada, with a company co-owned by a member of management. The lease, which commenced January 1, 2023, had
 an initial term of one year with a base rent of approximately 27,000 per month and included options to renew for up to four years. In November 2023, we exercised one of these options to renew for an additional one-year period. The rent expense
 recorded for the related party lease was 81,000 and 162,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Convertible Note and Election of Director

In connection with the issuance and sale of our Convertible Notes on March 31, 2023, the Board appointed Douglas Trussler, a co-founder of Bison Capital, to the Board. Mr. Trussler s compensation will be consistent with our previously disclosed
 standard compensation practices for non-employee directors, which are described in our Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on July 26, 2024.

 and our compliance with law, code, and regulations related to all matters including but not limited to environmental, information security, taxes, levies, tariffs and such. We have an immaterial amount accrued related to these exposures to various
 lawsuits and claims.

Critical Accounting Policies

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Disclosure Improvements

In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-06, Disclosure
 Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative . This standard was issued in response to the SEC s disclosure update and simplification initiative, which affects a variety of
 topics within the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected Topics unless otherwise indicated. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC s
 removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statement disclosures.

Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280) . This standard requires us to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided
 to the CODM and are included within each reported measure of segment operating results. The standard also requires us to disclose the total amount of any other items included in segment operating results, which were not deemed to be significant
 expenses for separate disclosure, along with a qualitative description of the composition of these other items. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the CODM s title and position, as well as detail on how the CODM uses the reported
 measure of segment operating results to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The standard also aligns interim segment reporting disclosure requirements with annual segment reporting disclosure requirements. This guidance is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial
 statement disclosures.

Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) . This standard requires us to provide further disaggregated income tax disclosures for specific
 categories on the effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as additional information about federal, state/local and foreign income taxes. The standard also requires us to annually disclose our income taxes paid (net of refunds received),
 disaggregated by jurisdiction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The standard is to be applied prospective basis, although optional retrospective application is permitted.
 We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial statement disclosures.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on
 June 11, 2024, and the 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 as filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and
 chief accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
 disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer concluded that MPA s disclosure controls and
 procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
 accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
 the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the three months ended
 September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
