All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, guidance, preliminary, project, estimate, outlook, expect, continue, will, intend, plan, targets, believe, forecast, future, potential, should, may, possible, could and variations of such words or similar expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Annual Report and found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including, but not limited to, the following: the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle Eastern conflicts on the global economy, including the impact on financial markets and the energy industry; 
 the level of capital spending and development by oil and gas companies, including potential reductions in capital expenditures by oil and gas producers in response to commodity price volatility and/or reduced demand; our reliance on a limited number of customers and a particular region for substantially all of our revenues; the impact of competition on our operations, including our ability to renew or replace expiring contracts on acceptable terms; the degree to which our exploration and production customers may elect to operate their water-management services in-house rather than outsource these services to companies like us; our customers ability to complete and produce new wells; risks related to acquisitions and organic growth projects, including our ability to realize their expected benefits; capacity constraints on regional oil, natural gas and water gathering, processing and pipeline systems that result in a slowdown or delay in drilling and completion activity, and thus a slowdown or delay in the demand for our services; our ability to retain key management and employees and to hire and retain skilled labor; our health, safety and environmental performance; the impact of current and future laws, rulings and federal and state governmental regulations, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, accessing water, handling of produced water, carbon

 Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond the ability of management to control or predict. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report or in our 2023 Annual Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.

Beneficial Reuse Projects We have a beneficial reuse strategic agreement (the Joint Industry Project or JIP with Chevron U.S.A. Inc., ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corporation (collectively with us, the alliance members to develop and pilot technologies and processes to treat produced water for potential beneficial reuse opportunities. We previously referred to this agreement as the Beneficial Reuse Strategic Agreement. In July 2024, Coterra Energy Inc. joined the JIP. Our goal under the JIP is to develop cost effective and scalable methods of treating produced water to create a potential water source for industrial, commercial and non-consumptive agricultural purposes. We are leading the engineering, construction and execution of the testing protocols and pilot projects, while leveraging the combined technical expertise of Chevron U.S.A., ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Coterra Energy Inc. The treated water may be reused in a variety of ongoing applications testing, including non-consumptive agriculture, low emission hydrogen production and the direct air capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The alliance members are working with appropriate regulators, with a goal to complete Phase 1 testing and performance evaluation of pilot technologies by the end of 2024. We are in the planning process for Phase 2 testing which will build upon and scale Phase 1 and is expected to launch in 2025. NAWI In April 2024, we signed an agreement with the National Alliance for Water Innovation NAWI to further investigate treatment of produced water using one of the pilot technologies, working with alliance members and Texas A M University, New Mexico State University, OLI Systems, Inc. and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Research Grant by the Department of Energy In December 2023, we were selected by the Department of Energy DOE to receive a research grant related to the treatment and desalination of produced water as an irrigation source for non-consumptive agriculture. The grant, which is currently in the negotiation phase, will allow us to expand our beneficial reuse for agriculture studies, following up on a greenhouse study conducted with Texas A M AgriLife that used desalinated produced water to grow cotton and grasses. A wide range of partners from academia, agriculture and the oil and gas industry are expected to contribute to the DOE study, which we will continue to lead. The study is designed to demonstrate and optimize field-scale produced water treatment and desalination which is customized for irrigation of non-consumptive crops such as cotton and biofuels. In addition, the study is expected to evaluate the extraction of valuable minerals and constituents contained in the produced water, such as ammonia, with the objective of investigating direct-use products for the

 agriculture industry. Importantly, the study is expected to support further evaluation of carbon sequestration benefits that are related to specific agricultural applications using treated produced water. Mineral Extraction Agreement In the second quarter of 2024, we signed a letter of intent with a development partner to construct an iodine extraction facility at one of our Permian Basin produced water management facilities. We anticipate that this first iodine extraction facility in the Permian Basin will be operational by year-end 2025 . General Trends and Outlook Market Dynamics The ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle Eastern conflicts have had significant global economic implications and impacts on financial markets and the energy industry . The extent of these impacts will depend on the severity and duration of these conflicts and whether the conflicts spread to other countries or regions. In addition, commodity prices continue to be volatile as they are impacted by multiple factors such as supply disruptions, current recessionary concerns and responses of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations to market conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil spot price was 76.43 and 78.58, respectively, as compared with average WTI spot prices of 82.25 and 77.27 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We believe there are several industry trends that continue to provide meaningful support for future growth. Our key customers capital allocation to the Permian Basin and New Mexico in particular remains consistent and significant, including on acreage where the water sourcing and production is dedicated to us. Permian Basin oil and associated water production growth continues to outpace production growth in other parts of the United States. Many industry trends such as simultaneous multi-well operations and reuse applications of produced water, particularly in the areas of the Permian Basin where we operate, are improving efficiencies and returns and provide us with significant opportunities for both our Produced Water Handling and Water Solutions businesses. Cost Inflation Since 2021, the U.S. has experienced increased wage and price inflation, as evidenced by increases in the Consumer Price Index CPI ). Although the current rate of consumer inflation has eased, core inflation remains elevated above the Federal Reserve s 2 target rate. The rate of inflation is expected to continue to be impacted by any further steps taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, such as adjustments to interest rates. Our long-term, fee-based produced water handling contracts are generally subject to annual CPI-based adjustments. However, many of our contractual CPI-based adjustments are capped at a maximum annual increase and, therefore, our costs may increase more rapidly than the fees that we charge to customers pursuant to our contracts with them. If inflation is higher than our contractually allowed fee increases, we could experience negative impacts to our operating margins. Seismicity We operate wells located in Seismic Response Areas in New Mexico and Texas, one of which is partially curtailed. Due to the integrated nature of our pipeline network and our system-wide redundancy, we have been able to adapt to regulatory responses to seismic activity, while continuing to provide service to our

Table of Contents 
 customers without material disruption in our operations. In addition, although we cannot anticipate with any certainty future regulatory actions and the effect such actions could have on our business, our compliance with state regulator seismic response actions to date has not resulted in any material volumetric, revenue or cash flow decreases.

We believe this presentation is used by investors and professional research analysts for the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies within our industry. Additionally, we use this information for comparative purposes within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as measures of liquidity or as alternatives to net income or gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income and other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as gross margin, operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA We use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure to assess the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to pay interest costs, support indebtedness and, at the discretion of our Board of Directors, return capital to equity holders. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure under our short-term incentive plan. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: interest expense income taxes depreciation,

 amortization and accretion expense abandoned well costs, asset impairment and abandoned project charges losses on the sale of assets transaction costs; research and development expense; change in payables related to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability as a result of state tax rate changes; loss on debt modification stock-based compensation expense; and other non-recurring or unusual expenses or charges (such as litigation expenses, severance costs and amortization expense related to the implementation costs of our new ERP system (as defined below)), less any gains on the sale of assets. Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel Our Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel are dependent upon the volume of produced water we gather and handle, the volume of recycled water and groundwater we sell and transfer, the fees we charge for such services and the recurring operating expenses we incur to perform such services. We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Gross Margin plus depreciation, amortization and accretion. We define Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel as Adjusted Operating Margin divided by total volumes handled, sold or transferred. Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin per Barrel are non-GAAP financial measures. We seek to maximize our Adjusted Operating Margin in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating our assets. Landowner royalties, utilities, direct labor costs, chemical costs, workover, repair and maintenance costs and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our expenses. Our operating expenses are largely variable and as such, generally fluctuate in correlation with throughput volumes. Our Adjusted Operating Margin incrementally benefits from increased Water Solutions recycled water sales. When produced water is recycled, we recognize cost savings from reduced landowner royalties, reduced pumping costs, lower chemical treatment and filtration costs and reduced power consumption.

When appropriate, we enhance shareholder returns by returning capital to shareholders, such as through dividend payments and share buybacks (to the extent determined by our Board of Directors). Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally generated cash flow, borrowings under our Credit Facility or accessing the capital markets. We believe that our cash flows, availability under our Credit Facility and leverage profile provide us with the financial flexibility to fund attractive growth opportunities in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 32.8 million and working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of 64.3 million. We had 400.0 million face value of Notes outstanding and 55.0 million outstanding under our Credit Facility, with 291.7 million of availability under our Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all the covenants under our Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Notes. On October 1, 2024, we made an interest payment of 15.3 million on the Notes. As of November 1, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of 50.0 million under our Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 7.504 . The borrowings are primarily being used to fund our capital program. We have an agreement with an unaffiliated water disposal company to dispose of a minimum volume of produced water. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining minimum commitment under this agreement was 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 21.7 million, undiscounted. As of September 30, 2024, we had short-term purchase obligations for products and services of approximately 4.6 million due in the next twelve months. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies. Dividends and Distributions Our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2024 and a dividend of 0.105 per share for each of the second and third quarters of 2024 on our Class A common stock. In conjunction with the dividend payments, a distribution of 0.09 per unit was paid to unit holders of Solaris LLC for the first quarter, and a distribution of 0.105 was paid to unit holders of Solaris LLC for each of the second and third quarters of 2024, subject to the same payment and record dates. Our Board of Directors declared a dividend on our Class A common stock for the fourth quarter of 2024 of 0.105 per share. In conjunction with the dividend payment, a distribution of 0.105 per unit will be paid to unit holders of Solaris LLC. The dividend will be paid on December 19, 2024 to holders of record of our Class A common stock as of the close of business on December 5, 2024. The distribution to unit holders of Solaris LLC will be subject to the same payment and record dates. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled 111.2 million as compared with 152.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease was primarily related to a net decrease of 17.3 million in working capital items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net increase of 51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to a decrease in accounts receivable balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash used in investing activities totaled 87.0 million as compared with 111.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily related to expenditures for property, plant and equipment. The decrease in expenditures during the nine months ended September 30 , 2024 was a result of lower capital spending required to accommodate our long-term contracted customers. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also includes 20.1 million for the sale of certain assets. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3.5 million and consisted of net Credit Facility borrowings of 29.0 million, 18.2 million in dividends and distributions payments, 5.6 million in payments related to the insurance premium financing and 1.4 million treasury stock repurchases related to tax withholding on stock awards that vested. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , net cash used in financing activities totaled 17.7 million and consisted of 1.0 million in net Credit Facility repayments, 16.1 million in dividends and distributions payments and 0.6 million treasury stock repurchases related to tax withholding on stock awards that vested. Capital Requirements We expect our capital expenditures will be between approximately 98.0 million to 105.0 million for 2024, which is based on our currently contracted customers latest outlooks on our dedicated acreage. Factors that could result in an increase in our capital expenditures include an increase in expected drilling activity due to the sale or exchange of dedicated acreage to customers with more active drilling practices and other changes in drilling programs. We intend to fund capital requirements through our primary sources of liquidity, which 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 include cash on hand and cash flows from operations and, if needed, our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility . Emerging Growth Company Status We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, we have more than 700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Currently, our market risks relate to potential changes in the fair value of our long-term debt due to fluctuations in applicable market interest rates. Going forward, our market risk exposure generally will be limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions, nor do we utilize financial instruments or derivative instruments for trading purposes. We believe that our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since those reported under Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, included in our 2023 Annual Report. Commodity Price Risk The market for our services is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas to the extent such fluctuations impact drilling and completion activity levels and thus impact the activity levels and timing of activity of our customers in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries. A portion of our revenue is directly exposed to fluctuations in the price of crude oil because one of our largest customer contracts provides for rates that periodically fluctuate within a defined range in response to changes in WTI. According to the terms of the contract, the per barrel fee increases when WTI exceeds a certain base price. In addition, skim oil sales revenue is directly exposed to fluctuations in the price of crude oil. We do not currently hedge our exposure to commodity price risk. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk on a portion of our long-term debt under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 55.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 8.017 . The outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility generally bear a rate of interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 0.1 plus an alternative base rate spread and are therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates on our borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 0.6 million.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as described below, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting identified in the evaluation for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we implemented a new Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system. In connection with this ERP system implementation, we updated our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. We will continue to monitor the impact of this implementation on our processes and procedures, as well as the impact on our internal controls over financial reporting. We do not believe that this ERP system implementation will have an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Due to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. During the reporting period, there have been no material changes to the status of the legal proceedings previously disclosed in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In the opinion of our management, there are no other pending litigation, disputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes or updates to our risk factors that were previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report.
