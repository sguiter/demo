 United States Brent Oil Fund, LP Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) For the period ended September 30, 2024 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period. As a result, investors should be aware that BNO would meet its investment objective even if there are significant deviations between changes in its daily NAV and changes in the daily price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, provided that the average daily percentage change in BNO s NAV over 30 successive valuation days is within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. BNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), the ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. (together, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts ), and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by BNO, BNO s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or in view of market conditions, and other crude oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for crude oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter or OTC transactions that are based on the price of crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Crude Oil-Related Investments ). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause BNO to invest in Other Crude Oil-Related Investments include, but are not limited to, those allowing BNO to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, collectively are referred to as Crude Oil Interests in the notes to the financial statements. USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in BNO s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in BNO s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically tracked the daily changes in the spot price of Brent crude oil. USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of BNO s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the spot price of Brent crude oil on a percentage basis, less BNO s expenses. Investors should be aware that BNO s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of Brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on Brent crude oil, nor is BNO s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. This is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation may impact and have impacted the total return on an investment in BNO s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in Brent crude oil and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of BNO s shares and the changes in the spot price of Brent crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing Brent crude oil, which could be substantial.) As of September 30, 2024, BNO held Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the ICE Futures Europe and did not hold any Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the NYMEX.

The purchase price for a Creation Basket is based upon the NAV of a share calculated shortly after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on the day the order to create the basket is properly received. Authorized Participants pay BNO a transaction fee for each order they place to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more baskets Redemption Baskets ), consisting of shares. Shares may be purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange in smaller increments than a Creation Basket or Redemption Basket. Shares purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange are not purchased or sold at the per share NAV of BNO but rather at market prices quoted on such exchange. In May 2010, BNO initially registered shares on Form S 1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). On June 2, 2010, BNO listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol BNO . BNO established its initial per share NAV by setting the price at and issued shares in exchange for . BNO also commenced investment operations on June 2, 2010, by purchasing Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures Europe based on Brent crude oil. BNO has an unlimited number of shares registered and available for issuance. On January 27, 2023, the SEC declared effective a registration statement filed by BNO that registered an unlimited number of shares. As a result, BNO has an unlimited number of shares that can be issued in the form of Creation Baskets. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosure required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ).

USCF pays the fees of BNY Mellon for its services under the BNY Mellon Agreements and such fees are determined by the parties from time to time. Brokerage and Futures Commission Merchant Agreements BNO entered into a brokerage agreement with RBC Capital Markets LLC RBC to serve as BNO s FCM effective October 10, 2013. BNO has engaged each of Marex North America, LLC, formerly RCG Division of Marex Spectron MNA ), Marex Capital Markets Inc., formerly E D F Man Capital Markets Inc.

ADMIS to serve as additional FCMs to BNO effective on May 28, 2020, June 5, 2020, December 3, 2020, and August 8, 2023, respectively. The agreements with BNO s FCMs require the FCMs to provide services to BNO in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through the applicable FCM for BNO s account. In accordance with the FCM agreements, BNO pays each FCM commissions of approximately to per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange, clearing and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts. Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when BNO issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when BNO redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket. Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio. BNO also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Crude Oil - Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less Treasuries ). Total commissions as annualized percentage of average total net assets The decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a lower number of Futures Contracts being held and traded.

 and , respectively. BNO also holds cash deposits with its custodian. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BNO held cash deposits in the amounts of and respectively, with the custodian and FCMs. Some or all of these amounts may be subject to loss should BNO s custodian and/or FCMs cease operations. For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, BNO is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short or that the value of the futures contract could fall below zero. As both a buyer and a seller of options, BNO pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. BNO s policy is to continuously monitor its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting controls and procedures. In addition, BNO has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty with which it conducts business. The financial instruments held by BNO are reported in its condensed statements of financial condition at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto of the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP BNO included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Forward-Looking Information This quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause BNO s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. BNO believes these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in inflation in the United States, movements in U.S. and foreign currencies, market volatility in the commodities markets and futures markets in part attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe BNO s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and BNO cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. BNO s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. BNO has based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and BNO assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although BNO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that BNO may make directly to them or through reports that BNO files in the future with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Introduction BNO, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The investment objective of BNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share NAV to reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of Brent crude oil, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on Brent crude oil as traded on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange (the ICE Futures that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on BNO s collateral holdings, less BNO s expenses. Near month contract means the next contract traded on the ICE Futures due to expire. Next month contract means the first contract traded on the ICE Futures due to expire after the near month contract. BNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in BNO s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over the same period. As a result, investors should be aware that BNO would meet its investment objective even if there are significant deviations between changes in its daily NAV and changes in the daily price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, provided that the average daily percentage change in BNO s NAV over 30 successive valuation days is within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. BNO s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of Brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on Brent crude oil, nor is BNO s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. The general partner of BNO, United States Commodity Funds LLC USCF ), believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments (as defined below).

 BNO invests primarily in futures contracts for crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the ICE Futures, the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by BNO, BNO s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or in view of market conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for crude oil, cleared swap contracts and OTC swaps that are based on the price of crude oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Crude Oil-Related Investments ). For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Crude Oil Interests in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in BNO s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in BNO s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that daily changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically closely tracked the daily changes in spot prices of Brent crude oil. USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of BNO s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the spot price of a barrel of Brent crude oil on a percentage basis, plus interest earned on BNO s collateral holdings, less BNO s expenses. Regulatory Disclosure The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are certain key regulatory requirements that are, or may be, relevant to BNO. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), CFTC, NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact BNO are discussed in Item 1. Business in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Exchange Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Designated contract markets DCMs ), such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by BNO is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that BNO invests in to meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures may also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit. The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 10,000 net futures contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 20,000 net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for Brent crude oil. If BNO and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for oil, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of BNO and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, BNO could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net futures contracts back to the accountability level. In contrast, the position limits for the ICE Futures maintain that when 100 lots or more are traded, the activity must be reported to the exchange on a daily basis. ICE Futures also maintains that an Expiration Limit of 6,000 lots, long or short, will apply for the five business days up to and including the expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, BNO held 3,018 Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the ICE Futures Europe and did not hold any Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the NYMEX. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the ICE Futures Europe or the NYMEX. Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that BNO will run up against such position limits because BNO s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO did not exceed any position limits imposed by the ICE Futures or the NYMEX.

 Federal Position Limits Part 150 of the CFTC s regulations (the Position Limits Rule establishes federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts that all market participants must comply with, with certain exemptions. The Benchmark Futures Contract is not subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule and, therefore, the Position Limits Rule is not expected to impact the ability of BNO to meet its investment objective. BNO has not limited the size of its offering and intends to utilize substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Benchmark Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments to the extent possible. If BNO encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Brent crude oil Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Brent crude oil Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed Brent crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its investment objective. In addition, if BNO exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures, and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of BNO s shares and the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. Margin for OTC Swaps Rules put in place by U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC and the SEC require the daily exchange of variation margin and initial margin for swaps between swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants Swap Entities and swaps between Swap Entities and their counterparties that are financial end-users (such rules, the Margin Rules ). The Margin Rules require Swap Entities to exchange variation margin with all of their counterparties who are financial end-users. The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap, taking into account the amount of variation margin previously posted or collected. Swap Entities are required to exchange initial margin with their financial end-users who have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of 8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Margin Rules). The Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin or variation margin (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold) and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes. BNO is not a Swap Entity under the Margin Rules, but it is a financial end-user. Accordingly, BNO will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Margin Rules for any swaps that it enters into. However, BNO does not have material swaps exposure under the Margin Rules, and accordingly, BNO will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Margin Rules. Mandatory Trading and Clearing of Swaps CFTC regulations require that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations derivative clearing organizations DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular class of swap and such swap is made available to trade on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if BNO enters into an interest rate or index-based credit default swap that is subject to these requirements, such swap will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps may be issued in the future, and, when finalized, could require BNO to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, initial and variation margin requirements are set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additional margin may be required and held by BNO s FCMs. Other Requirements for Swaps In addition to the margin requirements described above, swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements.

 Derivatives Regulations in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions In addition to U.S. laws and regulations, BNO may be subject to non-U.S. derivatives laws and regulations if it engages in futures and/or swap transactions with non-U.S. persons. For example, BNO may be impacted by European laws and regulations to the extent that it engages in futures transactions on European exchanges or derivatives transactions with European entities. Other jurisdictions impose requirements applicable to futures and derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the U.S., including position limits, margin, clearing and trade execution requirements. The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States. Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 could negatively affect BNO and the valuation and performance of BNO s investments. Infectious disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic may arise in the future and could adversely affect BNO and, more generally, individual issuers and capital markets, in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. For example, COVID-19 resulted in numerous deaths, travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines and the imposition of both local and more widespread work from home measures, cancellations, loss of employment, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer and institutional demand for goods and services, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020 had a material adverse impact on local economies in the affected jurisdictions and also on the global economy, as cross border commercial activity and market sentiment were impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain COVID-19 s spread. An infectious disease outbreak may arise in the future and could have the same or similar effects as the COVID-19 pandemic, or different effects that cannot be foreseen. Moreover, as was the case with the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by government and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world in response to an infectious disease outbreak, including the potential for significant fiscal and monetary policy changes, may affect the value, volatility, pricing and liquidity of some investments or other assets, including those held by or invested in by BNO. Public health crises caused by infectious disease outbreaks may exacerbate other preexisting political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally and their duration cannot be determined with certainty. In a rising rate environment, BNO may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities typically falls. In a rising interest rate environment, BNO may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. Interest rate risk is generally lower for shorter term investments and higher for longer term investments. The risk to BNO of rising interest rates may be greater in the future due to the end of a long period of historically low rates, the effect of potential monetary policy initiatives, including actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other foreign equivalents to curb inflation, and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates fall, BNO may be required to reinvest the proceeds from the sale, redemption or early prepayment of a Treasury Bill or money market security at a lower interest rate. BNO may potentially lose money by investing in government money market funds. BNO invests in government money market funds. Although such government money market funds seek to preserve the value of an investment at 1.00 per share, there is no guarantee that they will be able to do so and BNO may lose money by investing in a government money market fund. An investment in a government money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ), or any other government agency. The share price of a government money market fund can fall below the 1.00 share price. BNO cannot rely on or expect a government money market fund s adviser or its affiliates to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the government money market fund s 1.00 share price. The credit quality of a government money market fund s holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the government money market fund s share price. Due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of securities held by a government money market fund may vary. A government money market fund s share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets.

 Price Movements Brent crude oil futures prices were volatile and exhibited an uneven trend during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the period at 77.04 per barrel. The high of the period was on April 5, 2024 when the price reached 91.17 per barrel. The low for the period was on September 10, 2024, which was 69.19 per barrel. The period ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at 71.70 per barrel, a decrease of approximately 6.93 over the period. BNO s per share NAV began the period at 27.39 and ended the period at 28.28 on September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 3.25 over the period. The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the March 2024 contracts and ended with the December 2024 contracts. The decrease of approximately 6.93 on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and would not actually be realized by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the period to the end of the period, does not represent the actual benchmark results that BNO seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking BNO s Benchmark . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Brent crude oil futures experienced states of both contango and backwardation. When the market is in a state of contango, the near month Brent crude oil futures contract is lower than the price of the next month Brent crude oil futures contract, or contracts further away from expiration. During periods of backwardation, the near month Brent crude oil futures contract is higher than the price of the next month Brent crude oil futures contract, or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below. Valuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV The per share NAV of BNO s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. BNO s Administrator uses the ICE Futures settlement price (a weighted average price of trades during a three minute settlement period from 2:27 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the ICE Futures, but calculates or determines the value of all other BNO investments, including NYMEX contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time. Results of Operations and the Crude Oil Market Results of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, BNO had 7,650,000 shares outstanding. On January 27, 2023, the SEC declared effective a registration statement filed by BNO that registered an unlimited number of shares. As a result, BNO has an unlimited number of shares that can be issued in the form of Creation Baskets. More shares may have been issued by BNO than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. As of September 30, 2024, BNO had the following Authorized Participants: ABN AMRO Clearing USA LLC, Citadel Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs Co., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Jane Street Capital LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC and Virtu Americas LLC. For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

 Portfolio Expenses . BNO s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that BNO pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of BNO. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by BNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, the amount of income earned by BNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to an increase in commissions and professional fees. The decrease in total commissions accrued to brokers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a lower number of Brent Crude Oil Futures Contracts being held and traded.

Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by BNO, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, the amount of income earned by BNO as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to an increase in commissions and professional fees. The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a higher number of Brent Crude Oil Futures Contracts being held and traded.

 Tracking BNO s Benchmark USCF seeks to manage BNO s portfolio such that changes in its daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in BNO s per share NAV is within a range of 90 to 110 (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. As an example, if the average daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50 per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45 and 0.55 (i.e., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results). BNO s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of BNO s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for Brent crude oil. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. For the 30-valuation days ended September 30, 2024, the average daily change in price of the Benchmark Futures Contract was (0.273) , while the average daily change in the per share NAV of BNO over the same time period was (0.256) . The average daily difference was (0.017) (or 1.7 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ), meaning that over this time period BNO s NAV performed within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal. Since the commencement of the offering of BNO s shares to the public on June 2, 2010 to September 30, 2024, the average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was 0.028 , while the average daily change in the per share NAV of BNO over the same time period was 0.028 . The average daily difference was 0.000 (or 0.0 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ), meaning that over this time period BNO s NAV performed within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The following two charts demonstrate the correlation between the changes in BNO s NAV and the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. The first chart below shows the daily movement of BNO s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the 30 valuation day period ended September 30, 2024, the last trading day in September. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of BNO as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contract for the five years ended September 30, 2024. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS

Table of Contents 
 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of BNO versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of BNO, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that BNO s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the actual total return of BNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 3.25 . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 27.39 as of December 31, 2023 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2024 of 28.28. During this time period, BNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if BNO s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, BNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of 27.47 as of September 30, 2024, for a total return over the relevant time period of 0.29 . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of BNO of 3.25 and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 0.29 was a difference over the time period of 2.96 , which is to say that BNO s actual total return outperformed its benchmark by that percentage. BNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of BNO to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.

Table of Contents 
 By comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the actual total return of BNO as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 13.45 . This was based on an initial per share NAV of 28.26 as of December 31, 2022 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2023 of 32.06. During this time period, BNO made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if BNO s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, BNO would have had an estimated per share NAV of 31.20 as of September 30, 2023, for a total return over the relevant time period of 10.40 . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of BNO of 13.45 and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of 10.40 was a difference over the time period of 3.05 , which is to say that BNO s actual total return outperformed its benchmark by that percentage. BNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of BNO to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. There are three factors that typically have impacted or are most likely to impact BNO s ability to accurately track Benchmark Futures Contract in addition to the foregoing. First, BNO may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which BNO executes the trade. In that case, BNO may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than the closing settlement price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of BNO to either be higher or lower relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for BNO to obtain the settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact BNO s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract. Second, BNO incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of BNO to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. At the same time, BNO earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. BNO is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to BNO s NAV. When this income exceeds the level of BNO s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), BNO will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of BNO to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. If short-term interest rates rise above these levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would increase. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would decrease. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to stagnate over the near future. It is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by BNO may be lower than interest earned by BNO. As such, USCF anticipates that BNO could possibly outperform its benchmark so long as interest earned is greater than the fees and expenses paid by BNO. Third, BNO may hold Other Crude Oil-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return movements. In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of BNO that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO did not hold any Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. If BNO increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with market conditions, regulatory limits, and risk mitigation measures imposed by its FCMs, BNO may invest in Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, such as OTC swaps, which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error. OTC swaps increase transaction-related expenses due to the fact that BNO must pay to the swap counterparty certain fees that BNO does not have to pay for transactions executed on an exchange.

 Term Structure of Crude Oil Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns. Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from rolling futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near or front month contract) forward each month prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. As an example, assume that the price of Brent crude oil for immediate delivery, is 50 per barrel, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also 50. Over time, the price of Brent crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical barrels of Brent crude oil, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll forward of the futures contract must be executed every month. Contango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in BNO s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in Brent crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of BNO s shares and changes in the spot prices of Brent crude oil will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing Brent crude oil, which could be substantial. If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was 49 per barrel, or 2 cheaper than the 50 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing Brent crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the 49 next month futures contract would rise to 50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of Brent crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12 while the spot price of Brent crude oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10 . Similarly, the spot price of Brent crude oil could have fallen 10 while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8 . Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase. If the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is 50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures contract might be 51 per barrel, or 2 more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the 51 next month futures contract would fall to 50 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of Brent crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10 while the spot price of Brent crude oil may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12 . Similarly, the spot price of Brent crude oil could have fallen 10 while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12 . Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase. The chart below compares the daily price of the near month Brent crude oil futures contract to the price of the 13 th month Brent crude oil futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13 th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13 th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13 th month futures contract prices (contango).

 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13 th month Brent crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of the near month Brent crude oil futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation. When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The Brent crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years. The chart below shows the results from subtracting the average dollar price of the near 12-month contracts from the near month price for the 10-year period between September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2024. Investors will note that the Brent crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango.

 Historically, the Brent crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained primarily in contango until 2013. In 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC voted to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil producers, resulting in another multi-year period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango. In March 2020, contango dramatically increased and reached historic levels during the economic crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, related supply chain disruptions and ongoing disputes among oil producing countries over the potential limits on the production of crude oil, and a corresponding collapse in demand for crude oil and a lack of on-land storage for crude oil. This level of contango was due to significant market volatility that occurred in crude oil markets as well as futures markets. Crude oil prices collapsed in the wake of the COVID-19 demand shock, which reduced global petroleum consumption, and the price war launched by Saudi Arabia at the beginning of March 2020 in response to Russia s unwillingness to participate in extending previously agreed upon supply cuts. An estimated twenty million barrels a day of crude demand evaporated as a result of quarantines and massive drops in industrial and manufacturing activity. Eventually, the United States, OPEC, Russia, and other oil producers around the world agreed to a historic 9.7 million barrel per day cut to crude supply. The supply cut along with the partial reopening of economies during the third quarter of 2020 reduced some of the unprecedented volatility that oil markets experienced in the Spring of 2020. Likewise, contango returned to moderate levels in May of 2020. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Brent crude oil futures were in a state of backwardation as measured by the difference between the front month and the second month contract. Periods of contango or backwardation have not materially impacted BNO s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. This is because the impact of backwardation and contango tended to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both BNO s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods. Brent Crude Oil Market . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the price of the front month Brent crude oil futures contract traded in a range between 69.19 to 91.17. Brent crude prices decreased (6.84) from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024 to finish the quarter at 71.77. The simultaneous demand and supply shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and Saudi-Russia price war precipitated unparalleled risk and volatility in crude oil markets during the first half of 2020. Global demand for crude oil plummeted by as much as 30 in the spring of 2020 as workers around the world stopped driving, airlines cut flight schedules, and companies suspended operations. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil supply reached 13 million barrels per day (mbd), capping a period of almost continuous growth since 2016. To offset the seemingly unstoppable U.S. production juggernaut, OPEC+ (a loose coalition between OPEC and non-member nations such as Russia and Mexico) had maintained an uneasy series of agreements to curtail their crude oil output in order to support crude oil prices. However, in early March of 2020, Russia refused Saudi Arabia s proposal to extend cuts in response to the COVID-19 demand shock. The kingdom retaliated with a massive production increase, launching an all-out price war in the middle of a pandemic. Although the members of OPEC+ reached a record-shattering agreement in mid-April of 2020, the implementation of new supply cuts came too late to prevent crude oil prices from plummeting to historic lows, culminating in a drop into negative territory for the May WTI crude oil futures contract on April 20, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that crude oil demand fell an average of 16.4 mbd while global crude oil supply declined by an average of 13.7 mbd. Demand evaporated as a result of quarantines and massive drops in industrial and manufacturing activity. Supply declined largely due to the historic agreement in April of 2020 between the United States, OPEC, Russia, and other oil producers. The bulk of the supply decline came from voluntary OPEC+ cuts while 2.8 mbd resulted from market driven cuts in the United States. The unprecedented twin crises described above caused unparalleled effects on oil futures markets during 2020. First, multiple record-breaking returns occurred between March and May 2020. Brent crude oil prices averaged 33 during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 51 during the first quarter of 2020 and 64 during calendar year 2019. Second, Brent crude oil price volatility went off-the-charts. For example, the 30-day annualized volatility of Brent crude oil prices reached 140 after averaging 30 in 2019 and 28 in the first two months of 2020.

 Third, futures curves, which can exhibit conditions known as contango and backwardation , moved into a condition that some market experts referred to as super contango. Specifically, the front month Brent crude oil futures contract fell significantly relative to deferred contract months. On a percentage basis, the difference between the front and second month crude oil contracts was more than double the previous record. As economies reopened and OPEC+ supply cuts were absorbed by the market, Brent crude oil prices rose from a low of 19.33 in the spring of 2020 to an average of 70.87 per barrel during calendar year 2021. OPEC production declined from over 30 mbd pre-COVID-19 to a pandemic low of 22.5 mbd before gradually recovering to 28.1 mbd by December 2021. Likewise, crude oil production in the United States has recovered from pandemic lows but still has not reached pre-pandemic levels. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have decreased, elevated risk remains in the oil markets until the current and future COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures have fully subsided. Bullish fundamentals for crude oil prices were in place when Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, causing the United States and other countries and certain international organizations to impose broad-ranging economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian individuals, banking entities, and corporations as a response. The war in Ukraine, sanctions and the corresponding disruption in the supply of Russian oil, have resulted in significant volatility in the oil markets, particularly in early March when Brent crude oil briefly rose to over 127.98 per barrel on March 8, 2022, then fell back to 98.02 per barrel on March 16, 2022, before rising and the falling again to end the first quarter of 2022 at 107.91 per barrel. A bullish trend for crude oil emerged from mid-April through early June 2022 when Brent crude oil again topped 120 per barrel before, once again, giving up gains to end the quarter at 85.91. Crude oil prices struggled to find direction during the first half of 2023 with seventeen notable price reversals, most of which exceeded 5. Prices rose dramatically in the third quarter of 2023, from approximately 70 to over 90. This strong bull market completely reversed in the fourth quarter and by December crude had plunged back to the 70 to 75 range. U.S. crude oil production growth accelerated in late July and rose until the end of the year, finally surpassing pre-pandemic levels and reaching a record of 13.3 mbd in December 2023. U.S. crude oil production averaged 13.3 mbd and peaked at a record 13.4 mbd in the third quarter of 2024. OPEC crude production has mostly declined since late 2022. Globally, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that crude oil demand exceeded supply in the third quarter of 2024. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that world demand for crude oil will rise 1 mbd in 2025 while supply in non-OPEC countries alone will rise by 1.5 mbd. Should the IEA s forecast prove correct, crude oil prices will largely depend on OPEC s actions. Russia and OPEC have still not returned to pre-pandemic production levels, while the U.S. has become the world s largest crude oil producing nation and other oil producing nations have also increased their output. OPEC has fiercely supported prices with voluntary cuts and production quotas over the last several years. In June of 2024, OPEC announced that it would extend 1.65 mbd of previously agreed upon quotas until the end of 2025. OPEC also announced an extension of 2.2 mbd of voluntary cuts by some members until September of 2024, after which these voluntary reductions would be phased out over the following twelve months. Statements by oil ministers, particularly Saudi Arabia, emphasized that OPEC could change its plans if warranted by the data, reflecting the cartel s current preference for higher prices rather than market share. Indeed, in November, OPEC pushed the extension of voluntary cuts through December of 2024. If OPEC s strategic focus shifts from price support to market share defense, prices could come under pressure. Even if OPEC continues to postpone the unwinding of its cuts and voluntary quotas, any sluggishness in the global economy could weigh on prices. If the IEA s forecast proves accurate, OPEC or other producers would have to limit more production to maintain stable prices. Since demand and demand growth remain healthy for now, any new reductions in global output could be bullish for crude prices. The current geopolitical situation adds complexity to the supply-demand equation. Escalation of the crisis in the Middle East or the Russia-Ukraine war would increase the geopolitical risk premium and volatility in crude prices as these conflicts have the potential to create further supply disruptions and sanctions, as has been apparent during recent escalations between Israel and Iran. Crude oil prices may also be highly reactive to developments if global buyers and sellers of crude reposition relationships more than has already occurred, and which remains a possibility with geopolitical tensions between many nations rising. However, if a resolution to the conflicts were to occur, volatility could decrease, and prices could decline somewhat in a short period of time. Even short-term changes in perceived geopolitical risk can cause the market to change swiftly. The imminent U.S. presidential election may impact prices, though the president s influence is more limited than either candidate conveys. The election could briefly affect investor sentiment, but fundamental energy market changes will depend on enacted policies, not campaign promises. Ultimately, any administration s energy policy is constrained by various factors and external variables like a recession or OPEC policy typically have more impact.

 Brent Crude Oil Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories . USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation. A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation. That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions. For the ten-year time period between September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2024, the table below compares the monthly movements of Brent crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, diesel-heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.

 Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between Brent crude oil and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results. The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that Brent crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that Brent crude oil could have long-term correlation results that indicate prices of Brent crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of Brent crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long-term historical results suggest. The correlations between Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil, diesel-heating oil and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest BNO s assets in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in BNO s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the Benchmark Futures Contract, then their use could lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of Brent crude oil. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the condensed financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. BNO s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing BNO s condensed financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by BNO for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, BNO estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material. Liquidity and Capital Resources BNO has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. BNO has met, and it is anticipated that BNO will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. BNO s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations. BNO currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. BNO has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Crude Oil Interests. BNO invests in Crude Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments. A significant portion of BNO s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Crude Oil Interests. The balance of the assets is held in BNO s account at its custodian bank and in investments in money market funds and Treasuries at the FCMs. Income received from BNO s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to BNO. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO s expenses did not exceed the income BNO earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO did not use other assets to pay expenses. To the extent income exceeds expenses, BNO s NAV will be positively impacted. Although permitted to do so under its LP Agreement, BNO has not leveraged, and does not intend to leverage, its assets through borrowings or otherwise, and makes its investments accordingly. Consistent with the foregoing, BNO s investments will take into account the need for BNO to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its margin and collateral requirements and to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, BNO becoming leveraged. If market conditions require it, these risk reduction procedures, including changes to BNO s investments, may occur on short notice.

Table of Contents 
 BNO does not and will not borrow money or use debt to satisfy its margin or collateral obligations in respect of its investments, but it could become leveraged if BNO were to hold insufficient assets that would allow it to meet not only the current, but also future, margin or collateral obligations required for such investments. Such a circumstance could occur if BNO were to hold assets that have a value of less than zero. USCF endeavors to have the value of BNO s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by BNO or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil - Related Investments. BNO s investments in Crude Oil Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent BNO from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BNO did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, BNO cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future. Since the initial offering of shares, BNO has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business. BNO may terminate at any time, regardless of whether BNO has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement. In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) market conditions, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by BNO, BNO s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants) that would lead BNO to determine that it could no longer foreseeably meet its investment objective or that BNO s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses or its margin or collateral requirements make the continued operation of BNO unreasonable or imprudent, or (ii) adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal or removal of USCF as the general partner of BNO could cause BNO, to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate BNO. BNO s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment. Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio. Market Risk Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves BNO entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell crude oil at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed BNO s future cash requirements since BNO intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, BNO is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. BNO considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with BNO s commitments to purchase crude oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. However, should BNO enter into a contractual commitment to sell crude oil, it would be required to make delivery of the crude oil at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are no limits on the future price of crude oil, the market risk to BNO could be unlimited. BNO s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for crude oil, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by BNO. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital.

Table of Contents 
 Credit Risk When BNO enters into Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. BNO is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to BNO in such circumstances. USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of BNO by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, BNO generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of BNO to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of BNO in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to BNO, all assets of BNO relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. These FCMs are not allowed to commingle BNO s assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires FCMs to hold in a secure account BNO s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts. In the future, BNO may purchase OTC swaps, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of OTC swaps. As of September 30, 2024, BNO held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of 219,734,600 with the custodian and FCMs. Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should BNO s custodian or FCMs, as applicable, cease operations. Off Balance Sheet Financing As of September 30, 2024, BNO had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of BNO. While BNO s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on BNO s financial position. Redemption Basket Obligation In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, BNO requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets. BNO has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed. Contractual Obligations BNO s primary contractual obligations are with USCF. In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of BNO s NAV, currently 0.75 of NAV on its average daily total net assets. USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of BNO, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of BNO and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca, respectively. However, since BNO s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of BNO have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by BNO, and not by USCF. USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent as well as BNY Mellon s fees for performing administrative, custodial, and transfer agency services. BNY Mellon s fees for performing administrative services include those in connection with the preparation of BNO s condensed financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports. USCF and certain Related Public Funds have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI and CPER, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX. BNO also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements. 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 In addition to USCF s management fee, BNO pays its brokerage fees (including fees to FCMs), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses. The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of BNO s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation. Commission payments to FCMs are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis. BNO also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF. See Note 3 to the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as BNO s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of BNO s existence. Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements. As of September 30, 2024, BNO held 3,018 Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the ICE Futures Europe and did not hold any Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the NYMEX. For a list of BNO s current holdings, please see BNO s website at www.uscfinvestments.com. The end of day portfolio disclosed on BNO website would reflect any investments in Futures Contracts beyond the Benchmark Futures Contract, and/or Other Crude Oil-Related Investments, including any made in light of market conditions, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by BNO, BNO s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or other factors. Independent of the BNO website, BNO may make available portfolio holdings information to Authorized Participants that reflects BNO s anticipated holdings. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Price Risk. BNO is exposed to commodity price risk. In particular, BNO is exposed to Brent crude oil price risk through its holdings of Futures Contracts together with any other derivatives in which it may invest, which are discussed below. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Futures Contracts that BNO holds in its portfolio, as described in Contractual Obligations under Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, are expected to directly affect the value of BNO s shares. OTC Contract Risk BNO may purchase OTC contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts. Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. BNO may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by BNO, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of BNO shares. These EFRP transactions may expose BNO to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution. Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks. The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction. In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions. Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor.

Table of Contents 
 In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset BNO s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, BNO will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to BNO due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty and requires the posting by each party to cover the mark-to-market exposure of a counterparty to the other counterparty. USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board. Furthermore, USCF on behalf of BNO only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC. Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel. Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF. BNO will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support. Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations. In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. During the nine month reporting period ended September 30, 2024, BNO limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions. BNO anticipates that the use of Other Crude Oil-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of BNO. However, there can be no assurance of this. OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact BNO s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures BNO maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in BNO s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of BNO if BNO had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of BNO s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of BNO have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in BNO s internal control over financial reporting during BNO s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, BNO s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, BNO may be involved in legal proceedings arising primarily from the ordinary course of its business. BNO is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. In addition, USCF, as the general partner of BNO and the Related Public Funds may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. Except as described herein, USCF is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. Optimum Strategies Action On April 6, 2022, USO and USCF were named as defendants in an action filed by Optimum Strategies Fund I, LP, a purported investor in call option contracts on USO (the Optimum Strategies Action ). The action was in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut at Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-00511. The Optimum Strategies Action asserted claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act CUSA ). It purported to challenge statements in registration statements that became effective in February 2020, March 2020, and on April 20, 2020, as well as public statements between February 2020 and May 2020, in connection with certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint was seeking damages, interest, costs, attorney s fees, and equitable relief. On March 15, 2023, the court granted the USO defendants motion to dismiss the complaint. In its ruling, the court granted the USO defendants motion to dismiss, with prejudice, the plaintiff s claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a claim for control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Having dismissed all claims over which the court had original jurisdiction, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff s state law claim under CUSA and dismissed the claim without prejudice. No notice of appeal was filed. Settlement of SEC and CFTC Investigations On November 8, 2021, USCF and USO announced a resolution with each of the SEC and the CFTC relating to matters set forth in certain Wells Notices issued by the staffs of each of the SEC and CFTC as more fully described below. On August 17, 2020, USCF, USO, and John Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC (the SEC Wells Notice ). The SEC Wells Notice stated that the SEC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Subsequently, on August 19, 2020, USCF, USO, and Mr. Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the CFTC (the CFTC Wells Notice ). The CFTC Wells Notice stated that the CFTC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the CFTC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 4o(1)(A) and (B) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the CEA ), 7 U.S.C. 6o(1)(A) and (B) and 9(1) (2018), and CFTC Regulations 4.26, 4.41, and 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. 4.26, 4.41, 180.1(a) (2019). On November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF and USO, the SEC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act, directing USCF and USO to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(3) (the SEC Order ). In the SEC Order, the SEC made findings that, from April 24, 2020 to May 21, 2020, USCF and USO violated Section 17(a)(3) of 1933 Act, which provides that it is unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. USCF and USO consented to entry of the SEC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction.

 Separately, on November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF, the CFTC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the CEA, directing USCF to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 6o(1) (B), and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. 4.41(a)(2) (the CFTC Order ). In the CFTC Order, the CFTC made findings that, from on or about April 22, 2020 to June 12, 2020, USCF violated Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), which make it unlawful for any commodity pool operator CPO to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant and prohibit a CPO from advertising in a manner which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant, respectively. USCF consented to entry of the CFTC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction. Pursuant to the SEC Order and the CFTC Order, in addition to the command to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, and CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(2), civil monetary penalties totaling two million five hundred thousand dollars 2,500,000) in the aggregate were required to be paid to the SEC and CFTC, of which one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars 1,250,000) was paid by USCF to each of the SEC and the CFTC, respectively, pursuant to the offsets permitted under the orders. In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation On June 19, 2020, USCF, USO, John P. Love, and Stuart P. Crumbaugh were named as defendants in a putative class action filed by purported shareholder Robert Lucas (the Lucas Class Action ). The Court thereafter consolidated the Lucas Class Action with two related putative class actions filed on July 31, 2020 and August 13, 2020, and appointed a lead plaintiff. The consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-04740. On November 30, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the Amended Lucas Class Complaint ). The Amended Lucas Class Complaint asserts claims under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint challenges statements in registration statements that became effective on February 25, 2020 and March 23, 2020 as well as subsequent public statements through April 2020 concerning certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint purports to have been brought by an investor in USO on behalf of a class of similarly-situated shareholders who purchased USO securities between February 25, 2020 and April 28, 2020 and pursuant to the challenged registration statements. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint seeks to certify a class and to award the class compensatory damages at an amount to be determined at trial as well as costs and attorney s fees. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint named as defendants USCF, USO, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes III, as well as the marketing agent, ALPS Distributors, Inc., and the Authorized Participants: ABN Amro, BNP Paribas Securities Corporation, Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Company, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC.

USCF, USO, and the individual defendants in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation intend to vigorously contest such claims and have moved for their dismissal.

Table of Contents 
 The Wang Class Action asserted federal securities claims under the 1933 Act, challenging disclosures in a March 19, 2020 registration statement. It alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to investors in USO certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Wang Class Action was voluntarily dismissed on August 4, 2020. Mehan Action On August 10, 2020, purported shareholder Darshan Mehan filed a derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes, III (the Mehan Action ). The action is pending in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda as Case No. RG20070732. The Mehan Action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to USO and failed to act in good faith in connection with a March 19, 2020 registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation. USCF, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest such claims. In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation On August 27, 2020, purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc.

Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 (the Cantrell Action and Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06981 (the AML Action ), respectively. The complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 21D of the 1934 Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO s disclosures and defendants alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in 2020 that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action. The Court consolidated the Cantrell and AML Actions under the caption In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 and appointed co-lead counsel. All proceedings in In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation .

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in BNO s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 29, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), except for the following: Geopolitical risk, including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East conflict, has the potential to create further supply disruptions and sanctions, which could lead to further volatility. The Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions brought by the United States and other countries against Russia and others, the terror attacks by Hamas on Israel and ensuing conflict in the Middle East, and other geopolitical tensions, political unrest, and attacks or threats of attack by terrorists, are factors that could contribute to supply constraints, worker shortages, infrastructure and manufacturing energy usage and increase volatility in certain commodity prices. The Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact the economies of Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict, any sanctions, future market or supply disruptions, and the potential for wider conflicts may increase financial market volatility generally, have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and could lead to further volatility, including in the markets for commodities, including commodity futures, and the NAV or share price of BNO. However, if a resolution to the conflicts were to occur, volatility could decrease and prices could decline in a short period of time. The longer-term impact on commodities and futures prices, including the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, is difficult to predict and depends on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on BNO in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (a) None. (b) Not applicable. (c) BNO does not purchase shares directly from its shareholders. In connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Participants, BNO redeemed 24 baskets (comprising 1,200,000 shares) during the third quarter of the year ending December 31, 2024. The following table summarizes the redemptions by Authorized Participants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Total Number of Shares Average Price Per Period Redeemed Share 7/1/24 to 7/31/24 750,000 31.02 8/1/24 to 8/31/24 400,000 30.77 9/1/24 to 9/30/24 50,000 28.30 Total 1,200,000 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. No officers or directors of the Company have , modified or trading plans under either a Rule 10b5-1 or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.
