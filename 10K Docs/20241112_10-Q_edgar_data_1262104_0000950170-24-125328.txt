million since inception and expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. In connection with our July 2024 announcement regarding the evaluation of our strategic alternatives, we discontinued the clinical development of voruciclib, while certain nonclinical research and development activities continued. As a result, we continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of our nonclinical projects. We believe that our cash balance, including our short-term investments, will be sufficient to meet our obligations and fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of contract liabilities as of June 30, 2024, which was primarily related to the combined performance obligation for the transfer of development services under the KKC Commercialization Agreement and was a separate performance obligation in our contracts pursuant to research plans under the agreements, was as follows:

The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable and unbilled receivables (contract assets) and deferred revenue (contract liabilities). We invoiced our customers in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, typically at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Invoicing may have occurred subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled receivables. Advanced payments from our customers before revenue was recognized resulted in contract liabilities.

shares of common stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For purposes of the diluted net (loss) income per share calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their weighted-average exercise prices were above our weighted-average share price as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Depreciation expense of property and equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Impact of the Agreement (as discussed in Note 9. Leases As noted in Note 9. Lease s , we agreed to sell our furniture and fixtures to the landlord for on our lease termination date of September 30, 2024. We completed an evaluation of the impact of the Agreement, as defined in Note 9. Leases , on the carrying value of our property and equipment (Other Long-Lived Assets). This process included evaluating the remaining estimated useful lives, significant changes in the use and potential impairment charges related to the Other Long-Lived Assets. Based upon our evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 of approximately million for the furniture and fixtures sold to the landlord on September 30, 2024, which was included in the impairment of long-lived assets in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 . We also changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives of our leasehold improvements resulting in an acceleration of depreciation of approximately million during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

The charges that we expect to incur in connection with the 2024 RIF are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially. We may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the 2024 RIF. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded employee termination benefits of million and million within research and development and general and administrative expense, respectively.

 million. In July 2023, we entered into a termination agreement with KKC to mutually terminate the KKC Commercialization Agreement and all other related agreements between the parties (Termination Agreement) and jointly decided to discontinue zandelisib development in the U.S. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, KKC was responsible for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in Ex-U.S. and, subject to certain exceptions, was solely responsible for all costs related thereto. We also provided to KKC certain drug supplies necessary for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S., with the understanding that KKC would have assumed responsibility for manufacturing for the Ex-U.S. as soon as practicable. During fiscal year 2023, we updated our assessment of the total transaction price from the KKC Commercialization Agreement to reflect the upfront payment, milestone payments, estimated development cost-sharing, and deferred revenue. After announcing our plan to discontinue the global development of zandelisib outside of Japan, in December 2022, we decreased our estimate for variable consideration related to development cost sharing. With the execution of the Termination Agreement, we regained full, global rights (subject to KKC's limited rights for compassionate use) and KKC has no further rights to develop, use or commercialize zandelisib in the U.S., nor do we have any remaining performance obligations with all consideration received from KKC being nonrefundable. Therefore, the remaining long-term deferred revenue as of June 30, 2023 , of million that was allocated to the U.S. License obligation accounted for under Topic 808 at inception of the KKC Commercialization Agreement was recognized as revenue from collaboration agreements in the three months ended September 30, 2023, utilizing contract termination analogous to guidance provided in Topic 606. The million transaction price allocated to the U.S. License obligation accounted for under Topic 808 was included as noncurrent deferred revenue as of June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, we also had deferred revenue of approximately million related to the transaction price allocated to the Development Services performance obligations and recognized the remaining revenue based on the proportional performance of these development activities. The KKC Agreement was terminated on and all remaining amounts of deferred revenue were recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

 million to Presage. With respect to the first indication, an incremental million payment, due upon dosing of the first subject in the first registration trial, will be owed to Presage, for total payments of million prior to receipt of marketing approval of the first indication in the U.S., EU or Japan. Additional potential payments of up to million will be due upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We will also pay mid-single digit tiered royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed. As an alternative to milestone and royalty payments related to countries in which we sublicense product rights, we will pay to Presage a tiered percentage (which decreases as product development progresses) of amounts received from such sublicensees. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made no payments under the Presage license agreement. BeiGene Collaboration In October 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zandelisib in combination with BeiGene s zanubrutinib (marketed as Brukinsa ), an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase, for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies. Under the terms of the clinical collaboration agreement, we amended our ongoing Phase 1b trial to include evaluation of zandelisib in combination with zanubrutinib in patients with B-cell malignancies. Study costs are being shared equally by the parties, and we agreed to supply zandelisib and BeiGene agreed to supply zanubrutinib. We record the costs reimbursed by BeiGene as a reduction of our research and development expenses. We retained full commercial rights for zandelisib and BeiGene retained full commercial rights for zanubrutinib. With the discontinuation of the zandelisib program outside of Japan, this clinical collaboration was terminated on September 28, 2023. The Company did not recognize any cost reimbursement reductions within research and development during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cost reimbursements recorded as a reduction of research and development costs, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately million. 

 square feet of office space in San Diego, California. The lease agreement was scheduled to expire in March 2028 . We accounted for the lease agreement as an operating lease. The lease agreement contained an option to renew and extend the lease term, which was not included in the determination of the right-of-use (ROU) asset and operating lease liability, as it was not reasonably certain to be exercised. In July 2022, we amended the lease to extend the lease termination date from March 2028 to and to add an additional square feet of office space adjacent to our current office in San Diego (the Amended Lease). Upon commencement of the Amended Lease, we recognized an additional ROU asset and a corresponding operating lease liability of million. The Amended Lease includes variable non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance, maintenance, etc.) that are not included in the ROU asset and operating lease liability and are reflected as an expense in the period incurred as a component of the lease cost. Lease Termination On June 18, 2024 (the Agreement Date), we entered into a lease termination agreement (Agreement) with our landlord pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the lease for our existing office space as of . The original (as amended) scheduled expiration date was . As consideration for the Agreement, we agreed to pay the landlord a termination fee of approximately million (the Termination Fee) and to prepay the remaining rent due under the Agreement in the amount of approximately million (the Remaining Rent) and sell all the furniture and fixtures to the landlord for (see Property and Equipment within Note 3. Balance Sheet Details for further discussion on the impact of the Agreement on our property and equipment). We received our security deposit, which is classified as a component of prepaid and other current assets, from the landlord in October 2024. The Agreement was accounted for as a lease modification of the original contract. As a result of the Agreement, we reduced both the remaining ROU asset and lease liability by approximately , resulting in no impact to our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We reassessed the lease classification, as of the Agreement Date, noting the current classification as an operating lease remained appropriate. Both the Termination Fee and the Remaining Rent were paid prior to June 30, 2024. Subsequent to the payment of both the Termination Fee and the Remaining Rent, our lease liability was relieved and the balance was reduced to .

 million in connection with the Agreement which accordingly was recorded to the ROU assets as a direct cost of modifying the Agreement. As of the Agreement Date, we determined a triggering event, in accordance with ASC 360, had occurred and therefore completed an impairment analysis on its ROU asset resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 

Variable lease costs 

Total lease costs included in operating expenses 

As of June 30, 2024, we had remaining future minimum rental payments for our operating leases and the remaining ROU asset balance was million. As of September 30, 2024 , we had vacated the facility and the leased property reverted to the landlord. In addition, the ROU asset has been fully amortized. During fiscal year 2024, the ROU asset balance was increased by approximately million related to direct costs associated with the Agreement. Additionally, the ROU asset balance was decreased by: (1) approximately associated with our reassessment of the lease liability as of the Agreement Date and (2) million associated with the impairment of the ROU asset, as discussed above.

The February 2024 Shelf Registration Statement was filed February 20, 2024 and declared effective February 28, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024 , shares have been issued and sold under our ATM Program. Cooperation Agreement and Cash Dividend On October 31, 2023, we announced our entry into a Cooperation Agreement with Anson Funds Management LP and Cable Car Capital LLC, which, among other non-financial related items provided for a capital return to stockholders in the form of a dividend in the amount of per share of common stock that was declared on November 6, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on . The total dividend of million was paid on December 6, 2023 and was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, as we have an accumulated deficit, rather than retained earnings.

 Overview 
 MEI Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: MEIP) is a pharmaceutical company that has been developing novel and differentiated cancer therapies. We built our pipeline by acquiring promising cancer agents and creating value in programs through clinical development, strategic partnerships, and out-licensing or commercialization, as appropriate. Our approach to oncology drug development has been to evaluate our drug candidates in combinations with standard-of-care therapies to overcome known resistance mechanisms and address clear medical needs to provide improved patient benefit. Our drug candidate pipeline includes voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor, and prior to its sale (as discussed below) ME-344, an intravenous small molecule mitochondrial inhibitor targeting the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. 
 Strategic Alternatives 
 On July 22, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors (Board) had determined unanimously to begin the evaluation of our strategic alternatives, including potential transactions as well as an orderly wind down of operations, if appropriate, to maximize the value of our assets for our stockholders. We commenced a reduction-in-force (the 2024 RIF) beginning August 1, 2024, which will continue in stages as our operational and strategic direction evolves. We have discontinued the clinical development of voruciclib, while certain nonclinical activities related to MEI s drug candidate assets will continue to be conducted by us. As part of the review of strategic alternatives, we may consider options such as out-licensing opportunities for existing programs and merger and acquisition opportunities. 
 Consistent with our intention to preserve cash, David M. Urso, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Ghalie, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, stepped down effective August 1, 2024.

Voruciclib: Potent Orally Administered CDK9 Inhibitor in Phase 1 Studies 
 Following the announcement of the exploration of strategic alternatives on July 22, 2024, all ongoing clinical trial efforts for voruciclib have ceased, while certain nonclinical activities have continued. Voruciclib is a selective orally administered CDK9 inhibitor. Voruciclib recently completed a Phase 1 trial evaluating dose and schedule in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax (marketed as Venclexta ). Voruciclib is also being evaluated in pre-clinical studies to explore potential activity in various solid tumor cancers including in combination with therapies that target the RAS signaling pathway, such as KRAS inhibitors. 
 Voruciclib Scientific Overview: Cell Cycle Signaling 
 CDK9 has important functions in cell cycle regulation, including the modulation of two therapeutic targets in cancer: 
 CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), a member of the family of anti-apoptotic proteins which, when elevated, may prevent the cell from undergoing cell death and result in poor prognosis in cancer. Inhibition of CDK9 blocks the production of Mcl-1, which is also an established resistance mechanism to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. 

CDK9 is a transcriptional regulator of the MYC proto-oncogene protein (MYC) which regulates cell proliferation and growth. Upregulation of MYC is implicated in many human cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable patient survival. CDK9, in addition to being a transcription factor for MYC, also decreases phosphorylation of MYC protein that is implicated in stabilizing MYC in KRAS mutant cancers. 

Directly inhibiting MCL1 and MYC has historically been difficult, but CDK9 is a promising approach to indirectly target these oncogenes. 
 Voruciclib: Inhibition of MCL1 
 CDK9 is a known transcriptional regulator of MCL1. Over expression of MCL1 is frequently observed in many tumor types and is closely associated with tumorigenesis, poor prognosis and drug resistance. In AML, MCL1 is upregulated in about half of patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) disease and is associated with poor prognosis in these patients. Also important, high levels of MCL1 expression are associated with resistance to venetoclax. 
 In pre-clinical studies, voruciclib shows dose-dependent suppression of MCL1; in December 2017, a study of voruciclib published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports reported that the combination of voruciclib plus the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax was capable of inhibiting two master regulators of cell survival, MCL-1 and BCL-2, and achieved synergistic antitumor effect in an aggressive subset of DLBCL cells. 
 In a peer reviewed manuscript published in 2020, it was reported that the inhibition of CDK9 by voruciclib synergistically enhances cell death induced by the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models of AML. The data demonstrated that voruciclib synergizes with venetoclax to induce programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in both AML cell lines and primary patient samples. It was also demonstrated that voruciclib downregulates MCL1, which is relevant for the synergy between voruciclib and venetoclax, and further that voruciclib downregulates MYC, which also contributes to the synergies with venetoclax. 
 Subsequently, and consistent with the reported pre-clinical studies, data from an ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating voruciclib as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML have also demonstrated the anticipated decreases in Mcl-1 protein. 
 The research suggests that voruciclib is potentially an attractive therapeutic agent for treating cancers in combination with venetoclax or other BCL-2 inhibitors, to address potential resistance associated with MCL1, and is supportive of our ongoing clinical evaluation of voruciclib in AML.

 Voruciclib: Inhibition of MYC 
 Many cancers are associated with over expression of MYC, a transcription factor regulating cell proliferation and growth. CDK9 is a known regulator of MYC transcription and a modulator of MYC protein phosphorylation. Data reported at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2021 in preclinical models demonstrated that voruciclib: 
 Results in a rapid decrease in the phosphorylation of proteins that promote MYC transcription; 

Rapidly decreases phosphorylation of MYC protein on Ser62, a site implicated in stabilizing MYC in KRAS mutant cancers; 

Possesses single agent activity against multiple KRAS mutant cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo; and 

Synergistically inhibits KRAS G12C mutant cancer cell lines in combination with KRAS G12C inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo. 

The research presented suggests that voruciclib could be an attractive therapeutic agent for both hematological cancers, as well as solid tumors, dependent on the activity of MYC. 
 Clinical Programs 
 In a recent Phase 1 clinical trial, we evaluated the dose and schedule of voruciclib in combination with venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, in patients with R/R AML. The trial started with the evaluation of dose and schedule of voruciclib as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies and AML after failure of prior standard therapies to determine the safety, preliminary efficacy and maximum tolerated dose. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the safety and biologic effective dose of voruciclib monotherapy or voruciclib in combination with venetoclax. Secondary objectives of the study included assessing the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biomarkers of voruciclib monotherapy or voruciclib in combination with venetoclax. 
 As we reported in a poster presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2023, the voruciclib monotherapy dose escalation/expansion stage of the study enrolled a total of 40 patients and is complete. The majority of patients (n=21) had AML and the remaining patients (n=19) had B-cell malignancies. Of the 40 patients enrolled, the first 16 were dosed daily continuously at 50 and 100 mg and the following 24 patients were dosed on an intermittent schedule (14 consecutive days on therapy in a 28-day cycle) at 100, 150 and 200 mg. All patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies (range 1-9), and five patients had prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Voruciclib at doses up to 200 mg administered on 14 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle (Cohort 2) was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) reported. The most common adverse events 20 of patients) were diarrhea, nausea, anemia and fatigue. The large majority of adverse events were Grade 1-2; of note, the only Grade 3-4 adverse events in Cohort 2 were diarrhea (n=1) and anemia (n=5). Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and a mean half-life of approximately 24 hours supports once daily dosing. 
 On the intermittent dosing schedule selected for further development, no DLTs were observed, there were no Grade 3 or higher drug related toxicities, and dose escalation was stopped at 200 mg before reaching the maximum tolerated dose because plasma concentrations reached levels considered sufficient for target inhibition. In the 21 patients enrolled with AML, one patient at 100 mg achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state and nine patients had disease stabilization, which lasted at least three months in two patients. In the 19 patients enrolled with B-cell malignancies, four patients had stable disease with a decrease in tumor size. Initial results from correlative studies assessing myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) and RNA Pol II phosphorylation on Ser2 (RNA Pol II p-S2) demonstrated reduction in expression consistent with the anticipated on-target pharmacodynamic effect of voruciclib on Mcl-1 and RNA Pol II p-S2. 
 The next stage of the study evaluated seven voruciclib dose levels from 50 mg every other day to 300 mg daily for 14 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle in combination with standard dose venetoclax in patients with R/R AML. A total of 41 patients with R/R AML, median age 67 years (range 34-89), enrolled in this dose escalation stage of the study evaluating voruciclib in combination with venetoclax. These patients were generally heavily pretreated; the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-7), and 18 (44 patients had 3 prior lines. Almost all patients (39/41) were treated with venetoclax in an earlier line of therapy. Additionally, 30 (73 patients were noted as being in an adverse 2017 ELN Risk Category due to adverse cytogenetics and molecular mutations. 
 Of the 32 patients administered voruciclib at doses 100 mg in combination with venetoclax 10 (31 achieved disease control. Three patients achieved a response, including two patients that achieved a complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and one patient that achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), in each case having received venetoclax in an earlier line of treatment. Responses lasted 6 months in one patient, 9 months and ongoing in the second patient, and the third patient was referred to stem cell transplant. Further, an additional 7 patients had stable disease which lasted more than 90 days and 13 had stable disease

 In the 28 patients administered voruciclib in combination with venetoclax and with blood samples available for analysis, initial results from correlative biomarker assay studies demonstrated anticipated decreases of Mcl-1, including a greater decrease in Mcl-1 in responding patients. This supports our hypothesis that voruciclib, as an inhibitor or CDK9, regulates Mcl-1 and therefore may address the upregulation of MCL1 associated with venetoclax. Additional evidence of anti-leukemic activity was also demonstrated including decreases in bone marrow blast counts post voruciclib/venetoclax administration versus pre drug administration in ~50 (11/21) of evaluable patients. 
 Voruciclib at doses up to 300 mg administered on 14 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle in combination with standard dose venetoclax was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities observed. The maximum tolerated dose of voruciclib administered on this schedule with venetoclax has not been established. There were no discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events and no evidence of overlapping toxicity has been observed to date. The most common 5 of patients) grade 3 adverse events were myelosuppression associated with AML. Only 1 patient was observed as having a non-hematologic grade 3 drug-related adverse event (di arrhea). 
 Before ending the study, three patients were administered 150 mg voruciclib over 21 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle in combination with venetoclax to increase dose intensity and potentially optimize patient response based upon the rebound of peripheral blast counts in 44 (8/18) of the patients between Day 14 and Day 28 when voruciclib was stopped while continuing venetoclax. 
 Voruciclib was also previously evaluated in more than 70 patients with solid tumors in multiple Phase 1 studies. The totality of the clinical data, along with data from pre-clinical studies, suggests voruciclib s ability to inhibit its molecular target at a projected dose as low as 150 mg daily. In one clinical study, voruciclib was evaluated in combination with vemurafenib (marketed as Zelboraf in nine patients with BRAF mutated advanced/ inoperable malignant melanoma. All three BRAF/MEK naive patients achieved a response: two partial responses and one complete response. In this study voruciclib was dosed at 150 mg daily plus vemurafenib 720 mg or 960 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The most common adverse events were fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, arthralgia and headache. One instance of grade 3 fatigue was dose limiting and no serious adverse events related to voruciclib were reported. Other clinical studies evaluated voruciclib at doses up to 850 mg in patients with solid tumors, demonstrating additional evidence of potential biologic activity and an adverse event profile generally consistent with other drugs in its class. 
 ME-344: Mitochondrial Inhibitor with Combinatorial Potential 
 Nonclinical activities related to ME-344 continued following the announcement of the exploration of strategic alternatives on July 22, 2024 and ended with the closing of its sale, as discussed under Sale of ME-344 , elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. MEI-344 is a novel drug candidate that inhibits mitochondrial OXPHOS, a fundamental metabolic pathway involved in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the mitochondria. ATP provides energy to drive many metabolic cell processes, including division, proliferation, and growth. By disrupting the production of ATP, ME-344 has been shown to induce cancer cell death in nonclinical models and was associated with antitumor activity in clinical studies. ME-344 has also demonstrated clinical activity in multiple clinical studies in combinations, including with bevacizumab (Avastin ). 
 Recently, we were advancing ME-344 via development of a new formulation with the goal of increasing biological activity, improving patient convenience of administration and increasing commercial opportunity. We believe a new formulation represents the optimal approach to pursue the potential of the program after observing encouraging data in two clinical studies evaluating the prior ME-344 formulation in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin ). 
 ME-344 Scientific Overview: Cancer Metabolism 
 Energy supplied in the form of ATP fuels tumor metabolism supporting cell division and growth. Accordingly, tumor cells often display a high metabolic rate to support tumor cell survival and proliferation. This heightened metabolism requires a continual supply of energy in the form of ATP. 
 Anti-angiogenics, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab, have the potential to normalize vasculature and decrease reliance on glycolysis for ATP. The resulting reduction in glycolysis may trigger an increased dependence on mitochondrial ATP production for energy to support continued tumor proliferation. In such cases of tumor plasticity, the combination of ME-344 and bevacizumab may induce metabolic synthetic lethality, providing a novel therapeutic strategy. Specifically, leveraging the ability of antiangiogenics like bevacizumab to reduce glycolysis and force tumor cells to switch to mitochondrial respiration via OXPHOS, which is inhibited by ME-344, may reduce access to ATP needed for cell division and growth in tumors. 
 We obtained initial clinical data on this approach in a completed investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, controlled, window of opportunity clinical trial evaluating ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab that enrolled a total of 42 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. Further clinical support for the combination of ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab was reported in April 2024 from a Phase 1b study of patients with relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of standard therapies. This study demonstrated clinical activity, including an effect on progression free survival in a cohort of 23 patients.

 An earlier Phase 1 clinical study evaluating ME-344 as a single-agent in patients with refractory solid tumors also demonstrated anti-tumor activity, further validating the potential of mitochondrial inhibition as a promising therapeutic modality. 
 Clinical Program 
 ME-344 has been evaluated pre-clinically and clinically as a single agent and in combination with anti-angiogenics such as bevacizumab. When evaluated as a single agent, ME-344 demonstrated evidence of activity against refractory solid tumors in a Phase 1b trial, and in pre-clinical studies tumor cells treated with ME-344 resulted in a rapid loss of ATP and cancer cell death. In addition to single agent activity, ME-344 has also demonstrated significant potential in combination with anti-angiogenic therapeutics. 
 Pre-clinical studies have shown that one outcome of anti-angiogenics is a reduced rate of glycolysis in tumors as a mechanism to slow tumor growth. However, when faced with reduced glycolysis and reduced ATP production, tumor metabolism was able to shift to mitochondrial metabolism for energy production to support continued tumor proliferation. In such cases of tumor plasticity in the presence of treatment with anti-angiogenics, contemporaneously targeting the mitochondria as an alternative metabolic source of ATP with ME-344 may open an important development opportunity. 
 Support for this combinatorial use of ME-344 was first published in the June 2016 edition of Cell Reports; pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid demonstrated mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with agents that inhibit the activity of VEGF. These data demonstrating the potential anti-cancer effects of combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism provided a basis for commencement of an investigator-initiated trial of ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab in HER2 negative breast cancer patients. 
 Results published in the November 2019 issue of Clinical Cancer Research from a multi-center, investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled, clinical trial that evaluated the combination of ME-344 and bevacizumab in 42 women with early HER2-negative breast cancer provided evidence for the combinatorial use of ME-344 with anti-angiogenic therapeutics. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to show proof of ME-344 biologic activity as measured by reductions in the nuclear protein Ki67 (expression of which is strongly associated with tumor cell proliferation and growth) from days 0 to 28 compared to the control group who received bevacizumab alone. Secondary objectives included determining whether ME-344 biologic activity correlates with vascular normalization. The data demonstrated significant biologic activity in the ME-344 treatment group: 
 In ME-344 treated patients, mean absolute Ki67 decreases were 13.3 compared to an increase of 1.1 in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P=0.01). 

In ME-344 treated patients, mean relative Ki67 decreases were 23 compared to an increase of 186 in the bevacizumab monotherapy group (P Treatment was generally well tolerated; three grade 3 adverse events of high blood pressure were reported, two in the ME-344 arm and one in the bevacizumab monotherapy arm. 
 Building on the clinical study evaluating patients with breast cancer, a Phase 1b study evaluating ME-344 in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of standard therapies was initiated. The study was designed to evaluate ME-344 plus bevacizumab in up to two cohorts of approximately 20 patients each. The option to enroll the second cohort was conditioned upon Cohort 1 reaching a predetermined non-progression threshold of at least 20 at four months. Patients in the study were treated until disease progression or intolerability. The primary endpoint of the study was 16-week progression free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall PFS, duration of response, overall survival and safety. 
 ME-344 was administered once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with bevacizumab on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Cohort 1 enrolled a total of 23 patients with relapsed mCRC. Patients were generally heavily pretreated; the median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range 1-8), 18 (78 patients had 3 prior lines, and all patients had previously received bevacizumab and standard chemotherapy. As reported in April 2024, the combination was generally well tolerated with no overlapping toxicities observed. Two patients (9 discontinued therapy due to an adverse event: fatigue considered related to study drugs and sepsis considered unrelated. The most common 10 of patients) drug-related adverse events (all grades/grade 3) were fatigue in 8 (35 / 3 (13 patients and abdominal pain in 3 (13 / 2 (9 patients. 
 It was further reported that in the first cohort, 5 of 20 (25 evaluable patients completed 16 weeks of therapy without evidence of disease progression, exceeding the 20 predetermined threshold as set forth in the Clinical Study Protocol to proceed to Cohort 2. The median PFS was 1.9 months, the 4-month PFS rate was 31.2 , and the median overall survival was 6.7 months with 15 patients

 censored at the time of analysis. Nine (45 of the 20 evaluable patients had stable disease. Although Cohort 1 exceeded the predetermined PFS threshold, we decided not to initiate enrollment in a second cohort. 
 Results from an earlier, first-in-human, single-agent Phase 1 clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 edition of Cancer. The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38 treated with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the trial. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. 
 Through October 22, 2024, we were pursuing ME-344 via development of a new formulation to advance our novel approach to inducing synthetic lethality in tumors in combination with VEGF inhibitors such as bevacizumab (Avastin ). We had already initiated research and development activity of the new formulation, with the goal of increasing biological activity, improving patient convenience of administration and increasing commercial opportunity. 
 Also, through October 22, 2024, we were advancing ME-344 in combination with the anti-angiogenic antibody bevacizumab in a Phase 1b study evaluating patients with relapsed colorectal cancer. The study enrolled patients with progressive disease after failure of standard therapies with patients treated until disease progression or intolerance. The primary objective was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response, overall survival and safety. Additionally, ME-344 may also have clinical potential against hematological malignancies. At the AACR Annual Meeting 2022, a poster presentation reported results from preclinical studies exploring the ability of ME-344 to enhance the activity of venetoclax against AML. Data from the in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating the combination of ME-344 with venetoclax in standard-of-care-resistant AML cell lines and relapsed or refractory AML patient samples suggest that ME-344, both alone and in combination with venetoclax, inhibits purine biosynthesis, suppresses oxidative phosphorylation, induces apoptosis and decreases MCL-1, which together target metabolic vulnerabilities of AML cells. The data demonstrated that ME-344 and venetoclax prolong survival in MV4-11 and MV4-11/AraC-R-derived xenograft AML models. The poster concluded that ME-344 enhances venetoclax activity against AML cells including resistant AML. 
 Zandelisib: PI3K Inhibitor Overview 
 Zandelisib is an oral, once-daily, selective PI3K inhibitor that we were jointly developing with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (KKC) under a global license, development and commercialization agreement entered into in April 2020. 
 In March 2022, we and KKC jointly decided to discontinue global development of zandelisib for indolent forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma outside of Japan. The discontinuation of zandelisib development outside of Japan was a business decision based on the most recent regulatory guidance from the FDA and was not related to the zandelisib clinical data generated to date. After making the joint decision to terminate development outside of Japan, we and KKC began closing all ongoing zandelisib clinical studies outside of Japan, including the Phase 3 COASTAL trial, the Phase 2 TIDAL trial, and the Phase 2 CORAL trial. 
 Subsequently, in May 2023, KKC decided to discontinue development of zandelisib in Japan. The discontinuation of zandelisib in Japan was a business decision by KKC based on the most recent regulatory guidance from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan and was not related to the zandelisib clinical data generated to date. 
 KKC License, Development and Commercialization Agreement 
 In April 2020, we entered into the April 2020, License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with KKC (the KKC Commercialization Agreement) under which we granted to KKC a co-exclusive, sublicensable, payment-bearing license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop and commercialize zandelisib and any pharmaceutical product containing zandelisib for all human indications in the U.S. (the U.S. License), and an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights to perform obligations under the KKC Commercialization Agreement), sublicensable, payment- bearing, license under certain patents and know-how controlled by us to develop and commercialize zandelisib and any pharmaceutical product containing zandelisib for all human indications in countries outside of the U.S. (the Ex-U.S. and the Ex-U.S. License). Also, under the KKC Commercialization Agreement, we were granted a co-exclusive, sublicensable, license under certain patents and know-how controlled by KKC to develop and commercialize zandelisib for all human indications in the U.S., and a co-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid license under certain patents and know-how controlled by KKC to perform our obligations in the Ex-U.S. and were paid an initial non-refundable payment of 100.0 million. Additionally, in Japan, the KKC Commercialization Agreement included potential regulatory and commercialization milestone payments plus royalties on net sales of zandelisib in Japan, which are tiered beginning in the teens. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement as discussed below, KKC was responsible for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S. and, subject to certain exceptions, solely responsible for all costs related thereto. We

 also provided to KKC certain drug supplies necessary for the development and commercialization of zandelisib in the Ex-U.S., with the understanding that KKC would have assumed responsibility for manufacturing for the Ex-U.S. as soon as practicable. 
 On July 14, 2023, we entered into a Termination Agreement with KKC (the Termination Agreement) to mutually terminate the KKC Commercialization Agreement and all other related agreements between the parties. Pursuant to the Termi nation Agreement: 
 we regained full, global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize zandelisib, subject to KKC's limited rights to use zandelisib for compassionate use (as more specifically defined in the Termination Agreement) in certain expanded access programs for the existing patients who have been enrolled in Japanese clinical trial sponsored by KKC until November 30, 2027, and for which KKC is fully liable; 

each party released the other party from any and all claims, demands, etc. arising from the KKC Commercialization Agreement , excluding certain surviving claims; and 

we are obligated to deliver a discrete quantity of materials to facilitate KKC's compassionate use activities. 

As of June 30, 2023, we had 64.9 million of aggregate deferred revenue associated with the KKC Commercialization Agreement, of which 64.5 million was allocated to the U.S. License and 0.3 million was allocated to the Development Services performance obligations which were recognized based on the proportional performance of these development activities through wind-down of the associated trials. As further discussed in Note 7. License Agreements , in connection with the execution of the Termination Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized the 64.5 million of noncash long-term deferred revenue associated with the U.S. License as well as the remaining 0.3 million noncash deferred revenue associated with the completion of the underlying proportional performance activities. As of September 30, 2023, all deferred revenue associated with the KKC Commercialization Agreement had been recognized.

Research and development costs decreased by 0.3 million to 3.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Costs related to ME-344 decreased 0.9 million due to decreased manufacturing and clinical costs related to the Phase 1b study. Costs related to zandelisib decreased 0.4 million, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of the program during fiscal year 2023 and the completion of wind-down related activities. Costs related to voruciclib increased 1.1 million mainly due to greater recognized manufacturing and clinical costs in the Phase 1 study and costs associated with nonclinical studies. Other research and development costs decreased a net 0.1 million primarily due to reduced 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 payroll related costs partially offset by increased expenses associated with our plan to explore strategic alternatives that was announced in July 2024. 
 General and Administrative : General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.3 million to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 0.8 million decrease in legal costs and 0.6 in professional fees associated with various stockholder related items from the prior fiscal year with no current period recurrence, a 0.5 decrease in share-based compensation costs due to reversal of expense in excess of vested shares recognized upon execution of our 2024 RIF and a 0.4 million decrease in corporate overhead costs. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in expenses associated with the 2024 RIF partially offset by a decrease in payroll related costs. 
 Other Income, net: Other income, net, decreased by 0.8 million to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We received interest and dividend income of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily due to lower average balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations primarily through equity financings and license agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise additional capital in the future. We have accumulated losses of 396.2 million since inception and expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 26.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. On July 22, 2024, we announced that our Board had determined unanimously to begin the evaluation of our strategic alternatives, including potential transactions as well as an orderly wind down of operations, if appropriate, to maximize the value of our assets for our stockholders. In connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives, we initiated the 2024 RIF to reduce headcount on August 1, 2024 and discontinued the clinical development of voruciclib. As a result of this announcement, we expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly as we discontinued our clinical research and development activities along with decreased general and administrative costs as we reduce headcount and other operational expenses that supported research and development activities. We will continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with clinical trial closing costs and the completion of certain ongoing nonclinical activities. We believe our cash balance, including our short-term investments, is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. 
 Sources and Uses of Our Cash 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 11.5 million consisted of our net loss of 8.0 million and 3.9 million in changes in our operating assets partially offset by 0.5 million for noncash items. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 18.5 million consisted of our net income of 56.4 million and 0.8 million in noncash items offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 75.7 million primarily due to recognition of 64.9 million in deferred revenue. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.7 million as compared to 5.0 million cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to more net short-term investment activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital Resource Requirements 
 On June 18, 2024, we entered into a lease termination agreement (Agreement) with our landlord for our offices at 11455 El Camino Real, Suite 200 and Suite 250, San Diego, California. Under the Agreement, the lease terminated on September 30, 2024, rather than its scheduled expiration date of November 30, 2029. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we paid the landlord a termination fee totaling approximately 11.1 million in addition to prepaying the remaining rent under the Agreement in the amount of approximately 0.2 million. We have no further financial obligations under the Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have the following potential purchase obligations for which the timing and/or likelihood of occurrence is unknown; however, if such claims arise in the future, they could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Under our remaining license agreements, we have payment obligations, which are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and are required to make royalty payments in connection with the sales of products developed under those agreements. For additional details regarding

Table of Contents 

 these agreements, see the section titled Note 8. Other License Agreements and Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report; 

Obligations under contracts which are cancelable without significant penalty; 

Purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business as they represent authorizations to purchase the items rather than binding agreements; and 

Contracts in the normal course of business with clinical supply manufacturers and with vendors for preclinical studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts are cancelable and generally provide for termination after a notice period. 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the Board's decision regarding strategic alternatives; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the costs of establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities if we obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates; 

the costs of securing and producing drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies, clinical trials and for use as commercial supply; 

the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for development activities and commercial production; 

the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs; 

the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any; and 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims. 

Estimate Considerations Related to Macroeconomic Conditions and other Geopolitical Conditions 
 Due to recent disruptions in access to bank deposits and lending commitments associated with macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024. While there was no material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, these estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which could materially impact our condensed consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to the financial statements included in our 2024 Annual Report. We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our 2024 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since June 30, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncement

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, or September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of any potential changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Exhibit 10.2 

 Separation and Release Agreement 
 This Separation and Release Agreement Agreement is made between you, Dr. Richard Ghalie, and MEI Pharma, Inc., and sets forth the terms of your separation from employment with MEI Pharma, Inc. and its affiliates MEI ). This Agreement will become effective upon the Effective Date as specified in Section 10(i), below. Once effective, this Agreement will be a legally binding document representing the entire agreement between you and MEI regarding the subjects it covers. Throughout this Agreement, the term MEI includes all of MEI s affiliates and related entities, and their current and former trustees, officers, agents, employees, insurers and attorneys, and all other employee benefit plans and arrangements and their administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries, and all successors and assigns of all of the foregoing. 
 1. Separation Date . You and MEI agree that your employment with MEI will terminate on August 1, 2024 (the Separation Date ). In connection with your termination of employment, the Board of Directors of MEI has determined that you are eligible to receive the Separation Benefits (as defined below) commensurate with a termination by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason under the terms of the employment agreement between you and MEI, dated January 16, 2024 (the Employment Agreement ). 

2. Consideration and Post-Separation Benefits and Payments . 

(a) Eligibility . Provided that you (i) separate from employment on the Separation Date other than for Cause, (ii) sign and do not revoke this Agreement, including the waiver and release of claims in favor of MEI and the restrictive covenants contained in it, within 45 days of receiving this Agreement, and (iii) remain in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and your continuing obligations under your Employment Agreement and your Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement dated March 7, 2016, as amended Proprietary Information Agreement ), MEI agrees to provide you with the payments and benefits set forth in Section 2(b) below. 

(b) Consideration . Subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria in Section 2(a), above, MEI agrees to provide you with the following payments and benefits (collectively referred to as the Separation Benefits ): 

(i) Severance Payment . MEI will pay you a lump sum payment of 503,165, which is equal to 12 months of your annual base salary, within 60 days after the Separation Date. 

(ii) COBRA Reimbursement . Subject to your timely election of health care continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), MEI will pay the monthly premium payable to continue your and your eligible dependents participation in the MEI s group health plan (to the extent permitted under applicable law and the terms of such plan) which covers you (and your eligible dependents) for a period of 12 months following the Separation Date; provided that you are eligible and remain eligible for COBRA coverage; and further provided that in the event you obtain other employment that offers group health benefits, such continuation of coverage by MEI will immediately cease. If your COBRA coverage ceases because MEI s group health plan terminates prior to the end of the 12-month period described above, then an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium multiplied by the remaining months in the 12-month period will be paid as a lump sum, reduced by applicable withholding taxes, on the first day of the month following the date on which the health plan terminates (the COBRA Lump Sum Payment ). In connection with the COBRA Lump Sum Payment, MEI will pay an additional payment on your behalf, directly to the applicable taxing authorities, (the Gross-Up Payment at the time the COBRA Lump Sum Payment is made, in an amount equal to (i) the ordinary federal, state and local income and employment taxes due by you, if any, at that 

1 

Exhibit 10.2 

 time (the Taxes on the COBRA Lump Sum Payment plus (ii) an amount sufficient to cover the iterative Taxes on the Taxes. For clarity, this Gross-Up Payment is in the amount reasonably determined by MEI as necessary to put you in the same economic position as if you received the COBRA Lump Sum Payment without incurring the Taxes. You agree to cooperate and provide all necessary assistance and information to MEI to determine the amount of the Gross-Up Payment. 

(iii) Pro-Rated Annual Bonus . MEI will pay you a pro-rated target annual bonus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 (the Pro-Rated Bonus equal to 16,772. The Pro-Rated Bonus is determined by multiplying (i) your target annual bonus for the fiscal year by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during which you were employed by MEI in the fiscal year in which the Separation Date occurs and the denominator of which is 365. The Pro-Rated Bonus, if any, will be paid within 60 days after the Separation Date. 

(iv) Stock Option Accelerated Vesting and Exercise Period . Your outstanding options to purchase MEI common stock shall vest and become exercisable on an accelerated basis as of the Separation Date for the same number of shares that would have vested had you continued to be employed by MEI through the first anniversary of the Separation Date. All other unvested stock options shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Separation Date. You may exercise your vested stock options through the first anniversary of the Separation Date, or, if earlier, the end of the term of the options or the earlier termination of all MEI stock options, subject to the terms of the applicable option agreements (other than the 90-day post-termination exercise period, which shall not apply) and the equity plan. 

(c) Other Payments . Regardless of whether you sign this Agreement or when or why your employment with MEI terminates, MEI will provide you with any earned but unpaid base salary through the Separation Date, any accrued but unused vacation through the Separation Date, and any vested benefits under MEI s employee benefit plans in accordance with the terms of such plans, as accrued through the Separation Date. 

(d) Benefits Termination . For purposes of any benefits provided under any MEI benefits plan, your employment will terminate on the Separation Date, and benefits will cease on the Separation Date (other than health benefits that continue through the month in which the Separation Date occurs), consistent with the terms of the applicable benefit plans. You will receive information, under separate cover, regarding your rights under the COBRA health coverage continuation provisions of applicable law, as well as time frames necessary for continuations, conversions and/or distribution of benefits under MEI s benefit programs after your employment terminates. MEI reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or discontinue its benefit plans at any time, with or without prior notice. 

3. General Release of Claims . In exchange for the benefits provided under this Agreement and other valuable consideration, you, on behalf of yourself, your heirs, successors and assigns, voluntarily and of your own free will, hereby forever release, discharge and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, MEI and it parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their current and former, trustees, officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, employees, representatives, joint venturers, joint employers, benefit plans, fiduciaries and administrators, insurers, attorneys and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns (the Released Parties ), from any and all claims, rights, causes of action and demands of whatever nature, whether known or unknown, that you had, have or may have against MEI and the Released Parties, or any of them, arising from any act, event or omission which has occurred up through the date you execute this Agreement.

 You understand and acknowledge that you are hereby waiving and releasing any age claims or rights you may have under the ADEA, and that this waiver and release is knowing and voluntary. You understand and agree that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date you sign this Agreement. You understand and acknowledge that the consideration given for this waiver and release is in addition to anything of value to which you were already entitled. You further understand and acknowledge that you have been advised by this writing that: (a) you should consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement; (b) you have the periods described in Section 10 below to sign and revoke this Agreement.

Exhibit 10.3 

 Separation and Release Agreement 
 This Separation and Release Agreement Agreement is made between you, David Urso, and MEI Pharma, Inc., and sets forth the terms of your separation from employment with MEI Pharma, Inc. and its affiliates MEI ). This Agreement will become effective upon the Effective Date as specified in Section 10(i), below. Once effective, this Agreement will be a legally binding document representing the entire agreement between you and MEI regarding the subjects it covers. Throughout this Agreement, the term MEI includes all of MEI s affiliates and related entities, and their current and former trustees, officers, agents, employees, insurers and attorneys, and all other employee benefit plans and arrangements and their administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries, and all successors and assigns of all of the foregoing. 
 1. Separation Date . You and MEI agree that your employment with MEI will terminate on August 1, 2024 (the Separation Date ). In connection with your termination of employment, the Board of Directors of MEI has determined that you are eligible to receive the Separation Benefits (as defined below) commensurate with a termination by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason under the terms of the employment agreement between you and MEI, dated June 2, 2023 (the Employment Agreement ). 

2. Consideration and Post-Separation Benefits and Payments . 

(a) Eligibility . Provided that you (i) separate from employment on the Separation Date other than for Cause, (ii) sign and do not revoke this Agreement, including the waiver and release of claims in favor of MEI and the restrictive covenants contained in it, within 45 days of receiving this Agreement, and (iii) remain in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and your continuing obligations under your Employment Agreement and your Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement dated April 7, 2014 Proprietary Information Agreement ), MEI agrees to provide you with the payments and benefits set forth in Section 2(b) below. 

(b) Consideration . Subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria in Section 2(a), above, MEI agrees to provide you with the following payments and benefits (collectively referred to as the Separation Benefits ): 

(i) Severance Payment . MEI will pay you a lump sum payment of 614,000, which is equal to 12 months of your annual base salary, within 60 days after the Separation Date. 

(ii) COBRA Reimbursement . Subject to your timely election of health care continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), MEI will pay the monthly premium payable to continue your and your eligible dependents participation in the MEI s group health plan (to the extent permitted under applicable law and the terms of such plan) which covers you (and your eligible dependents) for a period of 12 months following the Separation Date; provided that you are eligible and remain eligible for COBRA coverage; and further provided that in the event you obtain other employment that offers group health benefits, such continuation of coverage by MEI will immediately cease. If your COBRA coverage ceases because MEI s group health plan terminates prior to the end of the 12-month period described above, then an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium multiplied by the remaining months in the 12-month period will be paid as a lump sum, reduced by applicable withholding taxes, on the first day of the month following the date on which the health plan terminates (the COBRA Lump Sum Payment ). In connection with the COBRA Lump Sum Payment, MEI will pay an additional payment on your behalf, directly to the applicable taxing authorities, (the Gross-Up Payment at the time the COBRA Lump Sum Payment is made, in an amount equal to (i) the ordinary federal, state and local income and employment taxes due by you, if any, at that 

1 

Exhibit 10.3 

 time (the Taxes on the COBRA Lump Sum Payment plus (ii) an amount sufficient to cover the iterative Taxes on the Taxes. For clarity, this Gross-Up Payment is in the amount reasonably determined by MEI as necessary to put you in the same economic position as if you received the COBRA Lump Sum Payment without incurring the Taxes. You agree to cooperate and provide all necessary assistance and information to MEI to determine the amount of the Gross-Up Payment. 

(iii) Pro-Rated Annual Bonus . MEI will pay you a pro-rated target annual bonus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 (the Pro-Rated Bonus equal to 25,583.33. The Pro-Rated Bonus is determined by multiplying (i) your target annual bonus for the fiscal year by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during which you were employed by MEI in the fiscal year in which the Separation Date occurs and the denominator of which is 365. The Pro-Rated Bonus, if any, will be paid within 60 days after the Separation Date. 

(iv) Stock Option Accelerated Vesting and Exercise Period . Your outstanding options to purchase MEI common stock shall vest and become exercisable on an accelerated basis as of the Separation Date for the same number of shares that would have vested had you continued to be employed by MEI through the first anniversary of the Separation Date. All other unvested stock options shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Separation Date. You may exercise your vested stock options through the first anniversary of the Separation Date, or, if earlier, the end of the term of the options or the earlier termination of all MEI stock options, subject to the terms of the applicable option agreements (other than the 90-day post-termination exercise period, which shall not apply) and the equity plan. 

(c) Other Payments . Regardless of whether you sign this Agreement or when or why your employment with MEI terminates, MEI will provide you with any earned but unpaid base salary through the Separation Date, any accrued but unused vacation through the Separation Date, and any vested benefits under MEI s employee benefit plans in accordance with the terms of such plans, as accrued through the Separation Date. 

(d) Benefits Termination . For purposes of any benefits provided under any MEI benefits plan, your employment will terminate on the Separation Date, and benefits will cease on the Separation Date (other than health benefits that continue through the month in which the Separation Date occurs), consistent with the terms of the applicable benefit plans. You will receive information, under separate cover, regarding your rights under the COBRA health coverage continuation provisions of applicable law, as well as time frames necessary for continuations, conversions and/or distribution of benefits under MEI s benefit programs after your employment terminates. MEI reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or discontinue its benefit plans at any time, with or without prior notice. 

3. General Release of Claims . In exchange for the benefits provided under this Agreement and other valuable consideration, you, on behalf of yourself, your heirs, successors and assigns, voluntarily and of your own free will, hereby forever release, discharge and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, MEI and it parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their current and former, trustees, officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, employees, representatives, joint venturers, joint employers, benefit plans, fiduciaries and administrators, insurers, attorneys and agents, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns (the Released Parties ), from any and all claims, rights, causes of action and demands of whatever nature, whether known or unknown, that you had, have or may have against MEI and the Released Parties, or any of them, arising from any act, event or omission which has occurred up through the date you execute this Agreement.

 You understand and acknowledge that you are hereby waiving and releasing any age claims or rights you may have under the ADEA, and that this waiver and release is knowing and voluntary. You understand and agree that this waiver and release does not apply to any rights or claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date you sign this Agreement.
