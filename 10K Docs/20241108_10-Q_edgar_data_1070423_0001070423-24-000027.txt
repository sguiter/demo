The information below includes the amount of consideration allocated to partially and wholly unsatisfied remaining performance obligations under contracts that existed as of the end of the periods and the timing of revenue recognition of those remaining performance obligations. Certain contracts meet the requirements for the presentation as remaining performance obligations. These contracts include a fixed minimum level of service, typically a set volume of service, and do not contain any variability other than expected timing within a limited range.

The presentation above does not include (i) expected revenues from legacy shippers not underpinned by minimum volume commitments, including pipelines where there are no or limited alternative pipeline transportation options, (ii) intersegment revenues and (iii) the amount of consideration associated with certain income generating contracts, which include a fixed minimum level of service, that are either not within the scope of ASC 606 or do not meet the requirements for presentation as remaining performance obligations. The following are examples of contracts that are not included in the table above because they are not within the scope of ASC 606 or do not meet the requirements for presentation: 
 
 Minimum volume commitments on certain of our joint venture pipeline systems; 
 Acreage dedications;

 million Series A preferred units, on a weighted-average basis, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common unit for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the effect was antidilutive. Our equity-indexed compensation plan awards that contemplate the issuance of common units are considered potentially dilutive unless (i) they become vested only upon the satisfaction of a performance condition and (ii) that performance condition has yet to be satisfied. Equity-indexed compensation plan awards that are deemed to be dilutive during the period are reduced by a hypothetical common unit repurchase based on the remaining unamortized fair value, as prescribed by the treasury stock method in guidance issued by the FASB.

(1) We classified these commercial paper notes as short-term as of December 31, 2023, as these notes were primarily designated as working capital borrowings, were required to be repaid within one year and were primarily for hedged NGL and crude oil inventory and NYMEX and ICE margin deposits. 
 (2) As of December 31, 2023, we classified our million, senior notes due November 2024 as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the notes on a long-term basis at that time. We redeemed these senior notes on November 1, 2024. 
 billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We estimated the aggregate fair value of these notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to be approximately billion and billion, respectively. Our fixed-rate senior notes are traded among institutions, and these trades are routinely published by a reporting service. Our determination of fair value is based on reported trading activity near the end of the reporting period. We estimate that the carrying value of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program approximates fair value as interest rates reflect current market rates. The fair value estimates for our senior notes and commercial paper program are based upon observable market data and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Senior Notes

 In August 2024, we amended our credit facility agreements to, among other things, extend the maturity dates of our senior secured hedged inventory facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility by to August 2027 and August 2029, respectively, for each extending lender. The maturity dates with respect to the non-extending lender under our senior secured hedged inventory facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (which represents a commitment of approximately million out of total commitments of billion from all lenders under each facility) remain August 2026 and August 2027, respectively.

 Letters of Credit 
 
 In connection with our merchant activities, we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase and transportation of crude oil and NGL.

 Our accounting policy is to offset derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists. Accordingly, we also offset derivative assets and liabilities with amounts associated with cash margin. Our exchange-traded derivatives are transacted through clearing brokerage accounts and are subject to margin requirements as established by the respective exchange. On a daily basis, our account equity (consisting of the sum of our cash balance and the fair value of our open derivatives) is compared to our initial margin requirement resulting in the payment or return of variation margin.

 Interest Rate Risk Hedging 
 
 We use interest rate derivatives to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with interest payments occurring as a result of debt issuances. The derivative instruments we use to manage this risk consist of forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. As such, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense as we incur the interest expense associated with the underlying debt.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we terminated million of notional interest hedging instruments for proceeds of million, which was recorded in AOCI. As of September 30, 2024, there was a net loss of million deferred in AOCI. The deferred net loss recorded in AOCI is expected to be reclassified to future earnings contemporaneously with interest expense accruals associated with underlying debt instruments. We estimate that substantially all of the remaining deferred loss will be reclassified to earnings through 2056 as the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. A portion of these amounts is based on market prices as of September 30, 2024; thus, actual amounts to be reclassified will differ and could vary materially as a result of changes in market conditions. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the net fair value of our interest rate hedges, which were included in Other long-term assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled million. At December 31, 2023, the net fair value of these hedges totaled million and million, which were included in Other current assets and Other long-term assets, net , respectively.

Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits Total 

In some cases, the actual cash expenditures associated with these liabilities may not occur for three years or longer. Our estimates used in determining these reserves are based on information currently available to us and our assessment of the ultimate outcome. Among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for, and potential modification of, our remediation plans, the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment and the possibility of existing or future legal claims giving rise to additional liabilities. Therefore, although we believe that the reserve is adequate, actual costs incurred (which may ultimately include costs for contingencies that are currently not reasonably estimable or costs for contingencies where the likelihood of loss is currently believed to be only reasonably possible or remote) may be in excess of the reserve and may potentially have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Specific Legal, Environmental or Regulatory Matters 
 
 Line 901 Incident . In May 2015, we experienced a crude oil release from our Las Flores to Gaviota Pipeline (Line 901) in Santa Barbara County, California. A portion of the released crude oil reached the Pacific Ocean at Refugio State Beach through a drainage culvert. Following the release, we shut down the pipeline and initiated our emergency response plan. A Unified Command, which included the United States Coast Guard, the EPA, the State of California Department of Fish and Wildlife CDFW ), the California Office of Spill Prevention and Response and the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Management, was established for the response effort. Clean-up and remediation operations with respect to impacted shoreline and other areas was determined by the Unified Command to be complete in 2016, and the Unified Command was dissolved. Our estimate of the amount of oil spilled, based on relevant facts, data and information, and as set forth in the Consent Decree described below, is approximately barrels; of this amount, we estimate that barrels reached the Pacific Ocean. 
 
 As a result of the Line 901 incident, several governmental agencies and regulators initiated investigations into the Line 901 incident, various claims have been made against us and a number of lawsuits have been filed against us, most of which have been resolved. Set forth below is a brief summary of actions and matters that are currently pending or recently resolved.

million in civil penalties and million as compensation for injuries to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources resulting from the Line 901 incident. The Consent Decree, which resolved all regulatory claims related to the incident, also contains requirements for implementing certain agreed-upon injunctive relief, as well as requirements for potentially restarting Line 901 and the Sisquoc to Pentland portion of Line 903. On October 13, 2022, Plains sold Line 901 and the Sisquoc to Pentland portion of Line 903 to Pacific Pipeline Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. As required by the terms of the Consent Decree, such purchaser assumed responsibility for compliance with the Consent Decree as it relates to the future ownership and operation of Line 901 and the Sisquoc to Pentland portion of Line 903. 
 
 Following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, in May of 2016, PAA was charged by a California state grand jury, pursuant to an indictment filed in California Superior Court, Santa Barbara County (the May 2016 Indictment ), with alleged violations of California law in connection with the Line 901 incident. Fifteen charges from the May 2016 Indictment were the subject of a jury trial in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County, and the jury returned a verdict on September 7, 2018, pursuant to which we were (i) found guilty on felony discharge count and misdemeanor counts (which included reporting count, strict liability discharge count and strict liability animal takings counts) and (ii) found not guilty on strict liability animal takings count. The remaining counts were subsequently dismissed by the Court. On April 25, 2019, PAA was sentenced to pay fines and penalties in the aggregate amount of just under million for the convictions covered by the September 2018 jury verdict (the 2019 Sentence ). The fines and penalties imposed in connection with the 2019 Sentence have been paid. In September 2021, the Superior Court concluded a series of hearings on the issue of whether there were any direct victims of the spill that are entitled to restitution under applicable criminal law. Through a series of final orders issued at the trial court level and without affecting any rights of the claimants under civil law, the Court dismissed the vast majority of the claims and ruled that the claimants were not entitled to restitution under applicable criminal laws. The Court did award an aggregate amount of less than to a handful of claimants and we settled with approximately 40 claimants before the hearings for aggregate consideration that is not material. The prosecution and certain separately represented claimants appealed the Court s rulings. The Appellate Court s order resulted in approximately of claims being remanded to the trial court for further adjudication and the affirmation of the trial court s dismissal of all other claims. 
 
 We also received individual lawsuits and claims from companies, governmental agencies and individuals alleging damages arising out of the Line 901 incident. These lawsuits and claims generally seek restitution, compensatory and punitive damages, and/or injunctive relief. Most of these lawsuits have been settled or dismissed by the court. We recently settled the following two lawsuits (the 2024 Settlements ): (i) a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County for lost revenue or profit asserted by a former oil producer that declared bankruptcy and shut in its offshore production platform following the Line 901 incident; and (ii) a lawsuit filed by the California State Land Commission in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County seeking lost royalties following the shut-down of Line 901, as well as costs related to the decommissioning of such platform. In connection with the 2024 Settlements, we recognized additional costs related to the Line 901 incident of million. Our remaining Line 901 lawsuits include various lawsuits filed in California Superior Court in Santa Barbara County by companies and individuals who provided labor, goods, or services associated with oil production activities they claim were disrupted following the Line 901 incident. We are vigorously defending these remaining lawsuits, which have not yet been set for trial, and believe we have strong defenses.

million (the Class Action Settlement ). The Class Action Settlement was formally approved by the trial court on September 20, 2022, and we made the million settlement payment on October 27, 2022 and the lawsuit was subsequently dismissed. 
 
 Plains formally submitted claims for reimbursement of the Class Action Settlement to our insurance carriers on November 7, 2022. To date, we have received payment of approximately million from one insurer, which represents the final payment obligation of such insurer and brings the total amount collected from all insurers under such program to million of the million policy limits as of September 30, 2024. Insurers responsible for million of the remaining million of coverage have formally communicated a denial of coverage for the Class Action Settlement, generally alleging that some or all damages encompassed by the Class Action Settlement are not covered by their policies and that all or some portion of the million for which Plains has already received insurance reimbursement does not properly exhaust the underlying policies that paid those sums. The insurer responsible for the final million of coverage under such insurance program has not yet accepted nor denied coverage. We have initiated final and binding arbitration proceedings against all of the insurers responsible for the remaining million of coverage with respect to which we have not received reimbursement. With respect to our reimbursement claim against insurers representing million of the million total reimbursement claim, a binding arbitration hearing was concluded in early October and we expect a decision from the arbitration panel in January 2025. We continue to believe that our claim for reimbursement from our insurers of the Class Action Settlement payment is strong and that our ultimate recovery of such amounts is probable. Our belief is based on: (i) our analysis of the terms of the underlying insurance policies as applied to the facts and circumstances that comprise our claim for reimbursement, (ii) our experience with the cost submissions and timely collection of claims for the million collected to date for this incident under the same insurance program as the denied claims, including from some of the same insurers who are now denying claims, (iii) our extensive legal review and assessment of the insurer s claimed basis for denial of coverage, which review and assessment includes the advice of external legal counsel experienced in these type of matters and solidly supports our belief that our insurers are required to provide coverage based on the terms of the policies and the nature of our claims, and (iv) the financial strength of the insurance carriers as determined by an independent credit ratings agency. Various factors could impact the timing and amount of recovery of our insurance receivable, including future developments that adversely impact our assessment of the strength of our coverage claims, the outcome of any dispute resolution proceedings with respect to our coverage claims (including the arbitration proceeding for which a hearing was completed in October) and the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. An unfavorable resolution could have a material impact on our results of operations.

million, which includes actual and projected emergency response and clean-up costs, natural resource damage assessments, fines and penalties payable pursuant to the Consent Decree, certain third-party claims settlements (including the Class Action Settlement and the 2024 Settlements), and estimated costs associated with our remaining Line 901 lawsuits and claims as described above, as well as estimates for certain legal fees and statutory interest where applicable. We accrue such estimates of aggregate total costs to Field operating costs in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. This estimate considers our prior experience in environmental investigation and remediation matters and available data from, and in consultation with, our environmental and other specialists, as well as currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations. We have made assumptions for (i) the resolution of certain third-party claims and lawsuits, but excluding claims and lawsuits with respect to which losses are not probable and reasonably estimable, and (ii) the nature, extent and cost of legal services that will be required in connection with all lawsuits, claims and other matters requiring legal or expert advice associated with the Line 901 incident. Our estimate does not include any lost revenue associated with the shutdown of Line 901 or 903 and does not include any liabilities or costs that are not reasonably estimable at this time or that relate to contingencies where we currently regard the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote. We believe we have accrued adequate amounts for all probable and reasonably estimable costs; however, this estimate is subject to uncertainties associated with the assumptions that we have made. For example, with respect to potential losses that we regard as only reasonably possible or remote, we have made assumptions regarding the strength of our legal position based on our assessment of the relevant facts and applicable law and precedent; if our assumptions regarding such matters turn out to be inaccurate (i.e., we are found to be liable under circumstances where we regard the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote), we could be responsible for significant costs and expenses that are not currently included in our estimates and accruals. In addition, for any potential losses that we regard as probable and for which we have accrued an estimate of the potential losses, our estimates regarding damages, legal fees, court costs and interest could turn out to be inaccurate and the actual losses we incur could be significantly higher than the amounts included in our estimates and accruals. Also, the amount of time it takes for us to resolve all of the current and future lawsuits and claims that relate to the Line 901 incident could turn out to be significantly longer than we have assumed, and as a result the costs we incur for legal services could be significantly higher than we have estimated. Accordingly, our assumptions and estimates may turn out to be inaccurate and our total costs could turn out to be materially higher; therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will not have to accrue significant additional costs in the future with respect to the Line 901 incident. 
 
 We recognized costs, net of amounts probable of recovery from insurance carriers, of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We did recognize any such costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had a remaining undiscounted gross liability of approximately million related to the Line 901 incident, which aggregate amount is reflected in Current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As discussed above, we maintain insurance coverage, which is subject to certain exclusions and deductibles, in the event of such liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, our incurred costs for the Line 901 incident have exceeded our insurance coverage limit of million related to our 2015 insurance program applicable to the Line 901 incident by million. Through September 30, 2024, we had collected, subject to customary reservations, approximately million out of the million of release costs that we believe are probable of recovery from insurance carriers (including the 2015 insurance program and our directors and officers (D O) insurance policies), net of deductibles. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have recognized a receivable of approximately million for the portion of the release costs that we believe is probable of recovery from insurance, net of deductibles and amounts already collected. We anticipate that the process to enforce our coverage claims with respect to the Class Action Settlement will take time and, accordingly, have classified the related receivable amounts as short-term and long-term based on the resolution status of the process as of the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2024, we have classified million of the receivable as a short-term asset in Trade accounts receivable and other receivables, net with the remaining million recognized as a long-term asset in Other long-term assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2023, we classified million as a long-term asset in Other long-term assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 We have completed the required clean-up and remediation work as determined by the Unified Command and the Unified Command has been dissolved; however, we expect to make payments for additional legal, professional and regulatory costs during future periods. Taking into account the costs that we have included in our total estimate of costs for the Line 901 incident and considering what we regard as very strong defenses to the claims made in our remaining Line 901 lawsuits, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of such remaining lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Crude Oil and NGL. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues. Our CODM (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on measures including Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) and maintenance capital. 
 
 The measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure used by our CODM in assessing performance and allocating resources among our operating segments. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as revenues and equity earnings in unconsolidated entities less (a) purchases and related costs, (b) field operating costs and (c) segment general and administrative expenses, plus (d) our proportionate share of the depreciation and amortization expense (including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments) of unconsolidated entities, further adjusted (e) for certain selected items including (i) gains and losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period (or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period), gains and losses on derivatives that are either related to investing activities (such as the purchase of linefill) or purchases of long-term inventory, and inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable, (ii) long-term inventory costing adjustments, (iii) charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments, (iv) amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments, net of the applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue and (v) other items that our CODM believes are integral to understanding our core segment operating performance and (f) to exclude the portion of all preceding items that is attributable to noncontrolling interests Segment amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests ).

 (3) We use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and our related processes include specific identification of hedging instruments to an underlying hedged transaction. Although we identify an underlying transaction for each derivative instrument we enter into, there may not be an accounting hedge relationship between the instrument and the underlying transaction. In the course of evaluating our results, we identify differences in the timing of earnings from the derivative instruments and the underlying transactions and exclude the related gains and losses in determining Segment Adjusted EBITDA such that the earnings from the derivative instruments and the underlying transactions impact Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same period. In addition, we exclude gains and losses on derivatives that are related to (i) investing activities, such as the purchase of linefill, and (ii) purchases of long-term inventory. We also exclude the impact of corresponding inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable. 
 (4) We carry crude oil and NGL inventory that is comprised of minimum working inventory requirements in third-party assets and other working inventory that is needed for our commercial operations. We consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we classify this inventory as long-term on our balance sheet and do not hedge the inventory with derivative instruments (similar to linefill in our own assets). We exclude the impact of changes in the average cost of the long-term inventory (that result from fluctuations in market prices) and write-downs of such inventory that result from price declines from Segment Adjusted EBITDA.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 
 
 The following discussion is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our financial condition and results of our operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information, see the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that are contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Executive Summary 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 Our business model integrates large-scale supply aggregation capabilities with the ownership and operation of critical midstream infrastructure systems that connect major producing regions to key demand centers and export terminals. As one of the largest crude oil midstream service providers in North America, we own an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins (including the Permian Basin) and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada. Our assets and the services we provide are primarily focused on crude oil and NGL. 
 
 Overview of Operating Results 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we recognized net income attributable to PAA of 736 million compared to 918 million during the first nine months of 2023. Results from our operations increased for the first nine months of 2024 over the comparable 2023 period due to more favorable results from our Crude Oil segment, partially offset by less favorable results from our NGL segment. Net income for the 2023 period includes favorable impacts from gains on asset sales and the mark-to-market adjustment of the Preferred Distribution Rate Reset Option, contributing to the relative decrease in net income in 2024. In addition, the 2024 results were impacted by an increase in costs associated with settlements related to the Line 901 incident that occurred in May 2015 and higher income tax expense. 
 
 See the Results of Operations section below for further discussion.

 Revenues and Purchases 
 
 Fluctuations in our consolidated revenues and purchases and related costs are primarily associated with our merchant activities and are generally explained by changes in commodity prices and the impact of gains and losses related to derivative instruments used to manage our commodity price exposure. Because both product sales revenues and purchases and related costs are generally based off of the same pricing indices, the market price of the commodities will not necessarily have an impact on the absolute margins related to those sales and purchases.

 Income Tax (Expense)/Benefit 
 
 The net unfavorable income tax variance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher year-over-year income within our Canadian operations as impacted by fluctuations of derivative mark-to-market valuations. 
 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 The net unfavorable income tax variance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher income tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 associated with Canadian withholding tax on dividends from our Canadian entities to other Plains entities. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 The increase in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to higher volumes, as well as contributions from acquisitions completed by the Permian JV. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses additional measures known as non-GAAP financial measures in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future and to assess the amount of cash that is available for distributions, debt repayments, common equity repurchases and other general partnership purposes. The primary additional measures used by management are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA, Implied distributable cash flow DCF ), Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions. 
 
 Our definition and calculation of certain non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA and Implied DCF are reconciled to Net Income, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions are reconciled to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Non-GAAP Financial Liquidity Measures for additional information regarding Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income tax (expense)/benefit, depreciation and amortization (including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization, including write-downs related to cancelled projects and impairments, of unconsolidated entities), gains and losses on asset sales, gains or losses on investments in unconsolidated entities and interest income on promissory notes by and among PAA and certain Plains entities, adjusted for certain selected items impacting comparability. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA excludes the portion of Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA and Implied DCF provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used to supplement related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to fund distributions to our unitholders through cash generated by our operations, (ii) provide investors with the same financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning/budgeting decisions and (iii) present measures that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial performance measures may exclude, for example, (i) charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments, (ii) gains and losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period (or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period), gains and losses on derivatives that are either related to investing activities (such as the purchase of linefill) or purchases of long-term inventory, and inventory valuation adjustments, as applicable, (iii) long-term inventory costing adjustments, (iv) items that are not indicative of our core operating results and/or (v) other items that we believe should be excluded in understanding our core operating performance. These measures may further be adjusted to include amounts related to deficiencies associated with minimum volume commitments whereby we have billed the counterparties for their deficiency obligation and such amounts are recognized as deferred revenue in Other current liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We also adjust for amounts billed by our equity method investees related to deficiencies under minimum volume commitments. Such amounts are presented net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue. We have defined all such items as selected items impacting comparability. We do not necessarily consider all of our selected items impacting comparability to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, but we believe that an understanding of these selected items impacting comparability is material to the evaluation of our operating results and prospects.

 Analysis of Operating Segments 
 
 We manage our operations through two operating segments: Crude Oil and NGL. Our CODM (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Adjusted EBITDA, segment volumes and maintenance capital investment. See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for our definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to PAA. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our definition of maintenance capital. 

Crude Oil Segment 
 
 Our Crude Oil segment operations generally consist of gathering and transporting crude oil using pipelines (including gathering systems), trucks and, at times, on barges or railcars, in addition to providing terminalling, storage and other related services utilizing our integrated assets across the United States and Canada. Our assets provide services to third parties as well as to our merchant activities. Our merchant activities include the purchase of crude oil supply and the movement of this supply on our assets or third-party assets to sales locations, including our terminals, third-party connecting carriers, regional hubs or to refineries. Our merchant activities are governed by our risk management policies. 
 
 Our Crude Oil segment generates revenue through a combination of tariffs, pipeline capacity agreements and other transportation fees, month-to-month and multi-year storage and terminalling agreements and the sale of gathered and bulk-purchased crude oil. Tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems are typically based on volumes transported and vary by receipt point and delivery point. Fees for our terminalling and storage services are based on capacity leases and throughput volumes. Generally, results from our merchant activities are impacted by (i) increases or decreases in our lease gathering crude oil purchases volumes and (ii) volatility in commodity price differentials, particularly grade and location differentials, as well as time spreads. The segment results also include the direct fixed and variable field costs of operating the crude oil assets, as well as an allocation of indirect operating costs. 
 
 The following tables set forth our operating results from our Crude Oil segment:

 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Crude Oil Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to higher tariff volumes on our pipelines, tariff escalations and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by fewer market-based opportunities. 
 
 The following is a more detailed discussion of the significant factors impacting Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Net Revenues and Equity Earnings. Our results were favorably impacted by (i) volume growth across our pipeline systems driven by increased production in the Permian Basin region as well as increased movements f rom the Rocky Mountain region to Cushing, Oklahoma, (ii) the benefit of tariff escalations and (iii) contributions from acquisitions. 
 
 Additionally, our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 reflect fewer crude oil market-based opportunities. 
 
 Field Operating Costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, we recognized higher expenses associated with (i) an increase in costs associated with settlements related to the Line 901 incident that occurred in May 2015 (which impact field operating costs, but are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and thus are reflected as an Adjustment in the table above), (ii) employee-related costs primarily resulting from higher average headcount and salaries, (iii) property taxes due to the impact of favorable adjustments in 2023 and (iv) incremental operating costs associated with acquisitions, partially offset by (v) decreased costs resulting from lower third-party trucked volumes. Field operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were also favorably impacted by lower utilities-related costs as a result of lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes and an increase in the amount of drag reducing agents used. 
 
 Maintenance Capital 
 
 The increase in maintenance capital spending for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to higher costs resulting from increased pipeline integrity activities and trucking lease buyouts. Additionally, the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same 2023 period was further impacted by timing of tank integrity activities. 

NGL Segment 
 
 Our NGL segment operations involve natural gas processing and NGL fractionation, storage, transportation and terminalling. Our NGL revenues are primarily derived from a combination of (i) providing gathering, fractionation, storage, and/or terminalling services to third-party customers for a fee, and (ii) our merchant activities of extracting NGL mix from the gas stream processed at our Empress straddle plant facility as well as acquiring NGL mix, which is then transported, stored and fractionated into finished products and sold to customers. The commodity exposure associated with our merchant activities is governed by our risk management policies. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Generally, our segment results are impacted by (i) increases or decreases in our NGL sales volumes, (ii) volatility in commodity price differentials, primarily the differential between the price of natural gas and the extracted NGL frac spread ), as well as location differentials and time spreads, (iii) the quality and volume of natural gas transported on third-party assets through our Empress straddle plant and (iv) our share of the NGLs received from a third-party straddle plant. 
 
 Our NGL operations are sensitive to weather-related demand, particularly during the approximate five-month peak heating season of November through March, and temperature differences from period-to-period may have a significant effect on NGL demand, and thus our financial performance, as well as the impact of comparative performance between financial reporting periods that bisect the five-month peak heating season.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 NGL Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of the impact of lower realized frac spreads, partially offset by higher propane and butane sales volumes. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 further benefited from incremental margins from iso-to-normal butane spreads in the first half of 2024. 
 
 Significant variances in the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA are discussed in more detail below. 
 
 Net Revenues. Net revenues include the impact of derivative activities and long-term inventory costing adjustments, which are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and thus are reflected as an Adjustment in the table above. Excluding such impacts, net revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 The decrease in net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to (i) lower realized frac spreads and (ii) lower field operating cost recoveries at our Empress straddle plants realized through our commercial agreements, partially offset by (iii) higher propane and butane sales volumes. 
 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 further benefited from incremental margins from iso-to-normal butane spreads in the first half of 2024. 
 
 Field Operating Costs. The decrease in field operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to (i) decreased utilities-related costs largely as a result of lower prices and (ii) a decrease in unrealized mark-to-market losses on power hedges (which impact our field operating costs, but are excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and thus are reflected as an Adjustment in the table above), partially offset by (iii) higher maintenance costs and (iv) higher employee-related costs primarily resulting from higher average headcount and salaries. The decrease in utilities-related costs was partially offset by the lower benefit to net revenues of operating cost recoveries realized through commercial agreements. 
 
 Maintenance Capital 
 
 The decrease in maintenance capital spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to timing of equipment repairs and replacement projects for certain of our pipeline systems and fractionation facilities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are (i) cash flow from operating activities and (ii) borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program. In addition, we may supplement these primary sources of liquidity with proceeds from asset sales, and in the past have utilized funds received from sales of equity and debt securities. Our primary cash requirements include, but are not limited to, (i) ordinary course of business uses, such as the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil, NGL and other products, payment of other expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt, (ii) investment and maintenance capital activities, (iii) acquisitions of assets or businesses, (iv) repayment of principal on our long-term debt and (v) distributions to our unitholders and noncontrolling interests. In addition, we may use cash for repurchases of common equity. We generally expect to fund our short-term cash requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and/or borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program. In addition, we generally expect to fund our long-term needs, such as those resulting from investment capital activities, acquisitions or refinancing our long-term debt, through a variety of sources, which may include any or a combination of the sources listed above.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital surplus of 33 million and approximately 3.3 billion of liquidity available to meet our ongoing operating, investing and financing needs, subject to continued covenant compliance, as noted below (in millions): 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 Availability under senior unsecured revolving credit facility (1) (2) 
 1,350 Availability under senior secured hedged inventory facility (1) (2) 
 1,316 Amounts outstanding under commercial paper program Subtotal 2,666 Cash and cash equivalents (3) 
 636 Total 3,302 
 
 (1) Represents availability prior to giving effect to borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program, which reduce available capacity under our credit facilities. 
 (2) Available capacity under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and senior secured hedged inventory facility was reduced by outstanding letters of credit issued under these facilities of less than 1 million and 34 million, respectively. 
 (3) Excludes restricted cash of 4 million. 
 
 In August 2024, we amended our credit facility agreements to, among other things, extend the maturity dates of our senior secured hedged inventory facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility by one year to August 2027 and August 2029, respectively, for each extending lender. The maturity dates with respect to the non-extending lender under our senior secured hedged inventory facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (which represents a commitment of approximately 64 million out of total commitments of 1.35 billion from all lenders under each facility) remain August 2026 and August 2027, respectively. 
 
 Usage of our credit facilities, and, in turn, our commercial paper program, is subject to ongoing compliance with covenants. The credit agreements for our revolving credit facilities (which impact our ability to access our commercial paper program because they provide the financial backstop that supports our short-term credit ratings) and the indentures governing our senior notes contain cross-default provisions. A default under our credit agreements or indentures would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt. As long as we are in compliance with the provisions in our credit agreements, our ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreements and indentures as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We believe that we have, and will continue to have, the ability to access our commercial paper program and credit facilities, which we use to meet our short-term cash needs. We believe that our financial position remains strong and we have sufficient liquid assets, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures. We are, however, subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow, including extended disruptions in the financial markets and/or energy price volatility resulting from current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). A prolonged material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity and cost of borrowing. Our borrowing capacity and borrowing costs are also impacted by our credit rating. See Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources.

 Non-GAAP Financial Liquidity Measures 
 
 Management uses the non-GAAP financial liquidity measures Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions to assess the amount of cash that is available for distributions, debt repayments, common equity repurchases and other general partnership purposes. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities, less Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities, which primarily includes acquisition, investment and maintenance capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated entities and the impact from the purchase and sale of linefill, net of proceeds from the sales of assets and further impacted by distributions to and contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the issuance of related party notes. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is further reduced by cash distributions paid to our preferred and common unitholders to arrive at Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions. Also see Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures above for more information about our non-GAAP measures. 
 
 The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial liquidity measures Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow after Distributions from Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (in millions):

 Investing Activities 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 In addition to our operating needs, we also use cash for our investment capital projects, maintenance capital activities and acquisition activities. We fund these expenditures with cash generated by operating activities, financing activities and/or proceeds from asset sales. The following table summarizes our investment, maintenance and acquisition capital expenditures (in millions): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Investment capital (1) (2) (3)

 188 169 Acquisition capital (2) (4) 
 146 295 629 749 
 
 (1) Capital expenditures made to expand the existing operating and/or earnings capacity of our assets are classified as Investment capital . Capital expenditures made to replace and/or refurbish partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the operating and/or earnings capacity of our existing assets are classified as Maintenance capital . 
 (2) Contributions to unconsolidated entities, accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that are related to investment capital projects by such entities are recognized in Investment capital . Acquisitions of initial investments or additional interests in unconsolidated entities are included in Acquisition capital . 
 (3) Investment capital and maintenance capital, net to our 65 interest in the Permian JV, was approximately 232 million and 174 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 221 million and 158 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (4) Acquisition capital, net to our 65 interest in the Permian JV, was approximately 141 million and 192 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Acquisition capital for the 2024 period primarily included the acquisition of additional ownership interests in equity method investees. Acquisition capital for the 2023 period was mainly comprised of the Rattler Permian Transaction. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding this transaction. 
 
 2024 Investment and Maintenance Capital. Total investment capital for the year ending December 31, 2024 is projected to be approximately 455 million 360 million net to our interest). Approximately half of our projected investment capital expenditures are expected to be invested in the Permian JV assets. Additionally, maintenance capital for 2024 is projected to be approximately 270 million 250 million net to our interest). We expect to fund our 2024 investment and maintenance capital expenditures primarily with retained cash flow. 
 
 Divestitures 
 
 Proceeds from the sale of assets have generally been used to fund our investment capital projects and reduce debt levels. The following table summarizes the proceeds received during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 from sales of assets (in millions):

 Ongoing Activities Related to Strategic Transactions 
 
 We are continuously engaged in the evaluation of potential transactions that support our current business strategy. In the past, such transactions have included the acquisition of assets that complement our existing footprint, the sale of non-core assets, the sale of partial interests in assets to strategic joint venture partners, and large investment capital projects. With respect to a potential acquisition or divestiture, we may conduct an auction process or participate in an auction process conducted by a third-party or we may negotiate a transaction with one or a limited number of potential sellers (in the case of an acquisition) or buyers (in the case of a divestiture). Such transactions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We typically do not announce a transaction until after we have executed a definitive agreement. In certain cases, in order to protect our business interests or for other reasons, we may defer public announcement of a transaction until closing or a later date. Past experience has demonstrated that discussions and negotiations regarding a potential transaction can advance or terminate in a short period of time. Moreover, the closing of any transaction for which we have entered into a definitive agreement may be subject to customary and other closing conditions, which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that our current or future efforts with respect to any such transactions will be successful, and we can provide no assurance that our financial expectations with respect to such transactions will ultimately be realized. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Acquisitions and divestitures involve risks that may adversely affect our business included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Related Party Promissory Notes 
 
 In July 2024, we and certain Plains entities issued promissory notes to facilitate financing. The cash outflow associated with our investment in CAD 865 million 629 million) of notes has an equal and offsetting cash inflow associated with proceeds from our issuance of notes for the same face value amount, which is included as a component of financing activities. See Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our related party notes. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our financing activities primarily relate to funding investment capital projects, acquisitions and refinancing of our debt maturities, as well as short-term working capital (including borrowings for NYMEX and ICE margin deposits) and hedged inventory borrowings related to our NGL business and contango market activities. 
 
 Borrowings and Repayments Under Credit Agreements 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments under our commercial paper program of 433 million. The net repayments resulted primarily from cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of 650 million, 5.70 senior notes in June 2024, which offset borrowings during the period related to funding needs for capital investments, inventory purchases and other general partnership purposes. 
 
 We had no net borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities or commercial paper program during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 In June 2024, we completed the offering of 650 million, 5.70 senior notes due September 2034 at a public offering price of 99.953 . Interest payments are due on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2025. We used the net proceeds from this offering of 643 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, along with other cash on hand, to repay on November 1, 2024 the principal amount of our 750 million, 3.60 senior notes due November 2024. Prior to such repayment, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes. 
 
 Common Equity Repurchase Program 
 
 There were no repurchases under the Common Equity Repurchase Program (the Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The remaining available capacity under the Program as of September 30, 2024 was 198 million.

Registration Statements 
 
 We periodically access the capital markets for both equity and debt financing. We have filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that, subject to effectiveness at the time of use, allows us to issue up to a specified amount of debt or equity securities Traditional Shelf ), under which we had approximately 1.1 billion of unsold securities available at September 30, 2024. We did not conduct any offerings under our Traditional Shelf during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also have access to a universal shelf registration statement WKSI Shelf ), which provides us with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. The offering of 650 million, 5.70 senior notes in June 2024 was conducted under our WKSI Shelf. 
 
 Distributions to Our Unitholders 
 
 Series A preferred unitholders. On November 14, 2024, we will pay a quarterly cash distribution of approximately 0.615 per unit to Series A preferred unitholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2024 for the period from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024. 
 
 Series B preferred unitholders. On November 15, 2024, we will pay a quarterly cash distribution of approximately 24.25 per unit to Series B preferred unitholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2024 for the period from August 15, 2024 through November 14, 2024. 
 
 Common Unitholders . On November 14, 2024, we will pay a quarterly cash distribution of 0.3175 per common unit 1.27 per unit on an annualized basis) to common unitholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 2024 for the period from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, which is unchanged from the distribution per unit paid in August of 2024. 
 
 See Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details of distributions paid during or pertaining to the first nine months of 2024, including distributions to our preferred unitholders. 
 
 Distributions to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Distributions to noncontrolling interests represent amounts paid on interests in consolidated entities that are not owned by us. As of September 30, 2024, noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries consisted of (i) a 35 interest in the Permian JV, (ii) a 30 interest in Cactus II and (iii) a 33 interest in Red River. See Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details of distributions paid to noncontrolling interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Contingencies 
 
 For a discussion of contingencies that may impact us, see Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Commitments 
 
 Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of doing business, we purchase crude oil and NGL from third parties under contracts, the majority of which range in term from thirty-day evergreen to five years, with a limited number of contracts with remaining terms extending up to 10 years. We establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sale and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales and future delivery obligations on the other. We do not expect to use a significant amount of internal capital to meet these obligations, as the obligations will be funded by corresponding sales to entities that we deem creditworthy or who have provided credit support we consider adequate.

The actual physical volume purchased and actual settlement prices will vary from the assumptions used in the table. Uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead, weather conditions, changes in market prices and other conditions beyond our control. 
 
 Letters of Credit. In connection with our merchant activities, we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase and transportation of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the product is purchased. Generally, these letters of credit are issued for periods of up to seventy days and are terminated upon completion of each transaction. Additionally, we issue letters of credit to support insurance programs, derivative transactions, including hedging-related margin obligations, and construction activities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately 108 million and 205 million, respectively.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We use various derivative instruments to manage such risks and, in certain circumstances, to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks by monitoring our exchange-cleared and over-the-counter positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity. We have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies, related controls around commercial activities and certain aspects of corporate risk management. Our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process. The following discussion addresses each category of risk. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We use derivative instruments to hedge price risk associated with the following commodities: 
 
 Crude oil 
 
 We utilize crude oil derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our pipeline, terminalling and merchant activities. Our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales, stored inventory and basis differentials. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, forwards, swaps and options. 
 
 Natural gas 
 
 We utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our natural gas processing assets (natural gas purchase component of the frac spread). Additionally, we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge anticipated operational fuel gas requirements related to our natural gas processing and NGL fractionation plants. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, swaps and options. 
 
 NGL and other 
 
 We utilize NGL derivatives, primarily propane and butane derivatives, to hedge commodity price risk inherent in our commercial activities, including the sale of the individual specification products extracted in our natural gas processing assets (sale of specification NGL products component of the frac spread), as well as other net sales of NGL inventory, held mainly at our owned NGL storage terminals. Our objectives for these derivatives include hedging anticipated purchases and sales and stored inventory. We manage these exposures with various instruments including futures, forwards, swaps and options. 
 
 See Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our hedging strategies and objectives. 
 
 The fair value of our commodity derivatives and the change in fair value as of September 30, 2024 that would be expected from a 10 price increase or decrease is shown in the table below (in millions): 
 
 Fair Value Effect of 10 Price Increase Effect of 10 Price Decrease Crude oil (23) 52 (51) Natural gas (39) 4 (4) NGL and other (26) (49) 49 Total fair value (88) 
 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 The fair values presented in the table above reflect the sensitivity of the derivative instruments only and do not include the effect of the underlying hedged commodity. Price-risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across-the-board 10 increase or decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price. In the event of an actual 10 change in near-term commodity prices, the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table as changes in near-term prices are not typically mirrored in delivery months further out. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Debt . Our use of variable rate debt and any forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt expose us to interest rate risk. Therefore, from time to time, we use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk associated with anticipated interest payments and, in certain cases, outstanding debt instruments. All of our senior notes are fixed rate notes and thus are not subject to interest rate risk. We did not have any variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. The average interest rate on variable rate debt that was outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.8 , based upon rates in effect during such period. The fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a net asset of 7 million as of September 30, 2024. A 10 increase in the forward SOFR curve as of September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an increase of 12 million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives. A 10 decrease in the forward SOFR curve as of September 30, 2024 would have resulted in a decrease of 12 million to the fair value of our interest rate derivatives. See Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our interest rate risk hedging activities. 
 
 Series B Preferred Units . Distributions on the Series B preferred units accumulate and are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November. Distributions on the Series B preferred units accumulate based on the applicable three-month SOFR, plus certain adjustments. Based upon the Series B preferred units outstanding at September 30, 2024 and the liquidation preference of 1,000 per unit, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual distributions on the Series B preferred units by approximately 8 million. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Series B preferred unit distributions.

 Re Grant of Phantom Units 
 
 Dear Salutation 
 
 I am pleased to inform you that, subject to the terms hereof, you have been granted a target number of Phantom Units equal to LTIP_Grant as of the above date pursuant to the Company s LTIP_Plan Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ). In addition, in tandem with each Phantom Unit you have been granted a distribution equivalent right (a DER ). A DER represents the right to receive a cash payment equivalent to the amount, if any, paid in cash distributions on one Common Unit of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. PAA or the Partnership to the holder of such Common Unit. The terms and conditions of this grant are as set forth below. 
 
 1. Subject to the further provisions hereof, your Phantom Units shall vest (become payable in the form of one Common Unit of PAA for each Phantom Unit that vests) as set forth below. With respect to Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 below, the actual number of Phantom Units that vest may be lower or higher than the percentage of target Phantom Units associated with such Tranche. 
 a. 50 of your Phantom Units Tranche 1 will vest on the August 2027 Distribution Date. 
 b. 25 of your Phantom Units Tranche 2 will vest pursuant to the terms and conditions described in Exhibit A attached hereto. 
 c. 25 of your Phantom Units Tranche 3 will vest pursuant to the terms and conditions described in Exhibit B attached hereto. 
 d. Any Tranche 2 or Tranche 3 Phantom Units that are determined not to have vested as of the August 2027 Distribution Date shall expire effective as of such date. 
 2. Subject to the further provisions hereof, your DERs shall vest (become payable in cash) as follows 
 a. The DERs associated with Tranche 1 will begin accruing on the November 2024 Distribution Date and will continue to accrue until the August 2025 Distribution Date, on which date such accrued but unpaid DERs will vest and be paid in a lump sum. Beginning on the November 2025 Distribution Date, such vested DERs will be paid quarterly until the associated Phantom Units vest or are forfeited pursuant to the terms hereof.

b. The DERs associated with Tranches 2 and 3 will begin accruing on the November 2024 Distribution Date and will continue to accrue until the associated Phantom Units vest or are forfeited pursuant to the terms hereof. Until such time as a final determination has been made regarding the number of Phantom Units that have vested for Tranche 2 and Tranche 3, such accruals will be based on the assumption that the final Payout Percentage as determined pursuant to Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, equals 100 . Once the final Payout Percentages and the final number of Phantom Units vesting for Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 have been determined, such accrued amounts shall be adjusted upward or downward, as applicable, so that they equal the total amount that would have been accrued in respect of the DERs associated with such vested Phantom Units had the accrual been based on such number of vested Phantom Units commencing on the November 2024 Distribution Date. Unless the Phantom Units subject to this award are forfeited or vest prior to the August 2027 Distribution Date pursuant to paragraphs 5, 6 or 7 below, all accrued and unpaid DERs associated with Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 shall be paid on the August 2027 Distribution Date or as soon thereafter as is administratively practicable. 
 3. The number of Phantom Units and DERs subject to this award, and with respect to the Phantom Units comprising Tranche 3, the distributable cash flow level required for vesting of such Phantom Units, shall be proportionately reduced or increased for any split or reverse split, respectively, of PAA Common Units, or any event or transaction having a similar effect. 
 4. Upon vesting of any Phantom Units, an equivalent number of DERs will expire. Any such DERs that are payable on the Distribution Date on which the Phantom Units vest, shall be payable on such Distribution Date prior to their expiration. 
 5. In the event of the termination of your employment with the Company and its Affiliates for any reason (other than in connection with a Change in Status or by reason of your death or disability, as defined in paragraph 6 below), all of your then outstanding Phantom Units and DERs shall automatically be forfeited as of the date of termination provided, however, that if the Company or its Affiliates terminate your employment other than as a result of a Termination for Cause, the following provisions shall apply (i) if such termination takes place prior to the first anniversary of the date of this grant, all of your then outstanding Phantom Units and DERs shall automatically be forfeited as of the date of termination and (ii) if such termination takes place after the first anniversary of the date of this grant, a pro rata portion of the target number of your then outstanding Phantom Units and DERs shall be deemed nonforfeitable on the date of termination and shall vest on the next following Distribution Date. The pro rata portion of Phantom Units vesting pursuant to clause (ii) immediately preceding shall be determined by multiplying the target number of your then outstanding Phantom Units by a fraction equal to the number of days between the grant date and the date of termination divided by the number of days between the grant date and the August 2027 Distribution Date (1,093). If the resulting amount includes a fraction, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

6. In the event of the termination of your employment with the Company and its Affiliates by reason of your death or your disability (a physical or mental infirmity that impairs your ability substantially to perform your duties for a period of eighteen months or that the Company otherwise determines constitutes a disability ), the following provisions shall apply (i) if such termination takes place prior to the first anniversary of the date of this grant, all of your then outstanding Phantom Units and DERs shall automatically be forfeited as of the date of termination and (ii) if such termination takes place on or after the first anniversary of the date of this grant, (x) all of your then outstanding Phantom Units (which shall be equal to the target number of Phantom Units specified in the first paragraph hereof) shall be deemed nonforfeitable on the date of termination and shall vest on the next following Distribution Date, and (y) any DERs associated with such unvested, nonforfeitable Phantom Units shall not be forfeited on the date of termination, but shall be payable and shall expire on the next following Distribution Date. As soon as administratively practicable after the vesting of any Phantom Units pursuant to this paragraph 6, payment will be made in cash in an amount equal to the Market Value of the number of Phantom Units vesting. 
 
 7. In the event of a Change in Status, (i) all of your then outstanding Phantom Units (which shall be equal to the target number of Phantom Units specified in the first paragraph hereof, except that in connection with a Change in Status that involves a Change of Control, the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to adjust the payout level for any Tranche 2 or Tranche 3 Phantom Units based on the performance of the Company under the applicable performance metric taking into account such Change of Control transaction, in each case as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee) shall be deemed nonforfeitable on such date and shall vest on the next following Distribution Date, and (ii) any DERs associated with such unvested, nonforfeitable Phantom Units shall not be forfeited on such date, but shall be payable and shall expire on the next following Distribution Date. 
 
 8. Upon payment pursuant to a DER, the Company will withhold any taxes due from your compensation as required by law. Upon vesting of a Phantom Unit, the Company will withhold any taxes due from your compensation as required by law, which (in the sole discretion of the Company) may include withholding a number of Common Units otherwise payable to you. 
 
 As used herein, (i) the Company refers to Plains All American GP LLC (ii) Distribution Date means the day in February, May, August or November in any year (as context dictates) that is 45 days after the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (or, if not a business day, the closest previous business day) and (iii) Market Value means the average of the closing sales prices for a Common Unit on Nasdaq for the five trading days preceding the then most recent ex dividend date for payment of a distribution by the Partnership.

A termination by you pursuant to (B) above shall not be a Change in Status unless (1) you provide written notice to the Company of the condition in (B)(i), (ii) or (iii) that would constitute a Change in Status within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition, and (2) the Company fails to remedy the condition within the 30-day period following such notice.

 Tranche 2 Vesting Terms (Total Shareholder Return) 
 
 1. General . Consistent with the Company s pay for performance philosophy and in order to more closely align the interests of management with the interests of investors, a portion of your Phantom Units will vest based on PAA s total shareholder return TSR compared to the TSR of a peer group as described below. TSR, which will be calculated using data from Bloomberg, is a primary long-term measure of PAA s performance. 
 2. Vesting and Payout . As soon as administratively feasible following the close of the three-year period ending on June 30, 2027 (the Performance Period ), the Compensation Committee shall determine and certify the TSR Payout Percentage (as defined below). The Compensation Committee shall make such determination based on a scaled payout range of between 0 and 200 as provided in the table below (the specific payout percentage is referred to as the TSR Payout Percentage based on PAA s TSR ranking at the end of the Performance Period compared to the TSR ranking of the various companies and or indices included in the PAA Peer Group described below. If PAA s absolute TSR is within 50 basis points of the TSR of one or more peer group comparators (i.e., 50 basis points higher or lower), PAA and such comparator(s) shall be deemed to have the same rank and the TSR Payout Percentage shall be equal to the average of the TSR Payout Percentages associated with the relevant rankings as set forth in the table below. If PAA s absolute TSR at the end of the Performance Period is less than 0 and the TSR Payout Percentage is greater than 100 , (i) a TSR Payout Percentage equal to or greater than 125 will be reduced by 25 gross percentage points, and (ii) a TSR Payout Percentage between 100 and 125 will be reduced to 100 . The number of Tranche 2 Phantom Units vesting will be determined by multiplying your target number of Tranche 2 Phantom Units by the TSR Payout Percentage as certified by the Compensation Committee. If the resulting amount includes a fraction, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

 In the event any member of the PAA Peer Group files for bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes under the United States Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law, such entity shall remain in the PAA Peer Group but shall be deemed to have a TSR of -100 for purposes of calculating the TSR Payout Percentage. In all cases involving the acquisition, merger, reorganization or other material change in ownership, legal structure or business operations of any member of the PAA Peer Group before the end of the Performance Period, the Compensation Committee shall have authority to retain, remove or replace such member, as applicable, for purposes of calculating the TSR Payout Percentage. In connection with any change to the PAA Peer Group, the Compensation Committee shall also have authority to make related adjustments to the rankings and TSR Payout Percentages.

Exhibit B 
 
 Tranche 3 Vesting Terms (Cumulative DCF with Leverage Modifier) 
 
 1. General . Consistent with the Company s pay for performance philosophy and in order to more closely align the interests of management with the interests of investors, a portion of your Phantom Units will vest based on PAA s cumulative distributable cash flow DCF per common unit equivalent CUE over a three-year period as described below. PAA s ability to sustain and increase DCF is a primary long-term measure of PAA s performance and is consistent with PAA s overall financial strategy. The final payout calculation will be subject to modification based on leverage levels at the end of the Performance Period the purpose of the potential leverage modifier is to insure that DCF performance remains tied to leverage levels assumed in PAA s long term plan as of the grant date (the Grant Date Plan ). 
 2. Vesting and Payout . As soon as administratively feasible following the close of the three-year period ending on June 30, 2027 (the Performance Period ), the Compensation Committee shall determine and certify the DCF Payout Percentage (as defined below). The Compensation Committee shall make such determination based on a scaled payout range between 0 and 200 as provided in the table below (the specific payout percentage is referred to as the DCF Payout Percentage based on PAA s cumulative DCF per CUE over the Performance Period. If PAA s cumulative DCF per CUE at the end of the Performance Period is between any two of the stated amounts in the table below, the DCF Payout Percentage will be interpolated between the two levels. In addition, the DCF Payout Percentage will be reduced by 25 gross percentage points (the Leverage Modifier if PAA s Leverage Ratio (long-term debt to adjusted EBITDA as calculated pursuant to PAA s senior unsecured revolving credit facility, modified to include customary adjustments deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee (for example, a net debt adjustment to account for certain cash balances reflected on PAA s balance sheet as of the applicable measurement date)) as of June 30, 2027 is higher than the Leverage Ratio that equals the upper end of PAA s then applicable target Leverage Ratio range (the Threshold Leverage Ratio (such range is 2.5x to 3.0x as of the date hereof) if PAA s Leverage Ratio as of June 30, 2027 is equal to or lower than the Threshold Leverage Ratio, there will be no adjustment to the DCF Payout Percentage. 
 
 Cumulative DCF Per CUE Over the Performance Period DCF Payout Percentage 8.71875 (112.5 of target) 200 8.4765625 175 8.234375 150 7.9921875 125 7.75 (target) 100 7.55625 75 7.3625 50 7.16875 25 6.975 (90 of target) 0 
 
 Note Both the cumulative DCF per CUE targets set forth in the table above and the initial Threshold Leverage Ratio referenced above are based on the Grant Date Plan, excluding the earnings and leverage impacts of potential asset sales (other than asset sales under contract as of the grant date). Accordingly, when calculating the DCF Payout Percentage, the following adjustments will be made 
 (a) the cumulative DCF per CUE target for the Performance Period as set forth in the table above will be adjusted downward to account for the loss of earnings assumed in the Grant Date Plan for any divested assets, net of avoided interest expense allocable to the divested assets (calculated based on an assumption that 100 of the net sales proceeds from such divestitures are used to reduce debt) and 
 B-1 

(b) with respect to any divested assets that were included as divestitures in the Grant Date Plan, the Threshold Leverage Ratio target will be adjusted to reflect the leverage impact of any such divested assets based on the assumptions originally set forth in the Grant Date Plan. 
 In addition, for the Leverage Modifier, the Leverage Ratio calculation will be adjusted up or down as appropriate to neutralize the impact on leverage of any DCF per CUE over or under performance that has already been taken into account in determining the final amount of cumulative DCF per CUE during the Performance Period (with the goal of isolating the balance sheet impact of other actions such as timing and amount of asset sales, amount of capital expenditures, etc.). In addition, the Compensation Committee shall have the ability to make adjustments to the Leverage Ratio calculation to the extent deemed appropriate in connection with leverage attributable to a transaction or project approved by the Company s Board of Directors (including, without limitation, transactions involving changes to the Company s capital structure). The number of Tranche 3 Phantom Units vesting will be determined by multiplying your target number of Tranche 3 Phantom Units by the DCF Payout Percentage as certified by the Compensation Committee. If the resulting amount includes a fraction, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. 
 Illustrative Examples (based on an assumed target number of Tranche 3 Phantom Units of 1,000 and based on an assumed Threshold Leverage Ratio of 3.0x, which is the Leverage Ratio that is equal to the upper end of PAA s current target Leverage Ratio range of 2.5x to 3.0x)
