 (1) Subsequent to August 31, 2024, the maturity date was extended to October 2024. 
 The Financial Services segment uses residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities to finance its residential lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to the Company and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. The LMF Commercial facilities finance LMF Commercial loan originations and securitization activities and were secured by up to interests in the originated commercial loans financed. 
 Collateral under the residential facilities 
 Borrowings under the LMF Commercial facilities 
 
 If the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be repaid by selling the mortgage loans held-for-sale to investors and by collecting receivables on loans sold but not yet paid for. Without the facilities, the Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities. 
 Substantially all of the residential loans the Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Purchasers sometimes try to defray losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. Mortgage investors could seek to have the Company buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans that the Company has sold based on claims that the Company breached its limited representations or warranties. The Company s mortgage operations have established accruals for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. The Company establishes accruals for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the residential mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed the Company s expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. The provision for loan losses was immaterial for both the three and nine months

 Sold Securitizations 
 (1) During both the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the commercial loans originated were recorded as loans held-for-sale, which are held at fair value. 
 Investments held-to-maturity 
 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Financial Services segment held commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ). These securities are classified as held-to-maturity based on the segment's intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity and changes in estimated cash flows are reviewed periodically to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. Based on the segment s assessment, impairment charges were recorded during the three or nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company has financing agreements to finance CMBS that have been purchased as investments by the Financial Services segment.

 Multifamily 
 The Company is actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated funds and joint ventures, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. The Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. 
 The Multifamily Segment (i) manages, and owns interests in, funds that are engaged in the development of multifamily residential communities with the intention of holding the newly constructed and occupied properties as income and fee generating assets, and (ii) manages, and owns interests in, joint ventures that are engaged in the development of multifamily residential communities, in most instances with the intention of selling them when they are built and substantially occupied. The multifamily business is a vertically integrated platform with capabilities spanning development, construction, property management, asset management, and capital markets. Revenues are generated from the sales of land, from construction activities, and management and promote fees generated from joint ventures less the cost of sales of land sold, expenses related to construction activities and general and administrative expenses. Operations of the Multifamily Segment also include equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other gains, which includes sales of buildings and investments.

 Doma Holdings, Inc. Doma ), which went public during the year ended November 30, 2021, is an investment that was accounted for under the equity method due to the Company's significant ownership interest of of Doma which allowed the Company to exercise significant influence. As of August 31, 2024, the Company s carrying value in Doma was zero as a result of allocated losses from Doma. 
 
 (3) 
 Underlying equity in unconsolidated entities' net assets (1) 
 (1) The basis difference was primarily as a result of the Company contributing its investment in three strategic joint ventures with a higher fair value than book value for an investment in FivePoint. 
 (2) Included in the Company's recorded investments in Homebuilding unconsolidated entities is the Company's ownership of FivePoint. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company's investment was million and million, respectively. 
 As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Homebuilding segment's unconsolidated entities had non-recourse debt with completion guarantees of million and million, respectively. 
 The Company has an immaterial amount of recourse exposure to debt of the Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which it has investments. While the Company sometimes guarantees debt of unconsolidated entities, in most instances the Company s partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their shares of any payments. In most instances, the amount of guaranteed debt of an unconsolidated entity is less than the value of the collateral securing it. 
 As of both August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the fair values of the repayment guarantees, maintenance guarantees, and completion guarantees were not material. The Company believes that as of August 31, 2024, in the event it becomes legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, the collateral would be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or the Company and its partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, the Company has placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities with regard to obligations of its joint ventures (see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). The details related to these are unchanged from the disclosure in

 billion. The commitments are primarily from institutional investors, including million committed by Lennar. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company's investment in Upward America was million and million, respectively. 
 Multifamily Unconsolidated Entities 
 The unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Multifamily segment has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In connection with many of the bank loans to the Multifamily unconsolidated joint ventures, the Company (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion and cost over-runs to the lenders and partners. The details related to these are unchanged from the disclosure in the Company's Notes to the Financial Statements section in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. As of both August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the fair value of the completion guarantees was immaterial. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Multifamily segment's unconsolidated entities had non-recourse debt with completion guarantees of million and billion, respectively. 
 General contractor costs Management fee income, net of deferrals 
 The Multifamily segment includes managing and investing in Multifamily Venture Fund I LMV I ), Multifamily Venture Fund II LP LMV II and Canada Pension Plan Investments Fund (the CPPIB Fund ), which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. The Multifamily segment completed the closing of the CPPIB Fund. The Multifamily segment expects the CPPIB Fund to have almost billion in equity and Lennar's ownership percentage in the CPPIB Fund is . As of August 31, 2024, the Company had a million investment in the CPPIB Fund. Additional dollars will be committed as opportunities are identified by the CPPIB Fund. 
 Equity commitments Equity commitments called Lennar's equity commitments Lennar's equity commitments called Lennar's remaining commitments (1) Distributions to Lennar 
 
 As of November 30, 2023, there were rental operation projects in LMV I. During the second half of fiscal 2024, the LMV I partners decided to liquidate and sell all of the individual rental operation projects of LMV I as the fund has come to the end of its contractual life. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, LMV I rental operation projects were sold to various third-party buyers. The Company recognized a net gain of million on the sale of these rental operation projects which was recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As a result, the Company received net cash distributions of million during the three months ended August 31, 2024.

 million and million as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company is entitled to a portion of the carried interest distributions by those funds. The Company also had strategic technology investments in unconsolidated entities and investment funds with a carrying value of million and million, as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, there was a million one-time realized gain in Lennar Other on the sale of a technology investment that was included in other income (expense), net and other gains (losses) on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

 Financial Services residential loans held-for-sale - Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. The Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these are included in Financial Services loans held-for-sale as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023. Fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics. 
 LMF Commercial loans held-for-sale - The fair value of commercial loans held-for-sale is calculated from model-based techniques that use discounted cash flow assumptions and the Company s own estimates of CMBS spreads, market interest rate movements and the underlying loan credit quality. The details and methods of the calculation are unchanged from the fair value disclosure in the Company's Notes to the Financial Statements section in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. These methods use unobservable inputs in estimating a discount rate that is used to assign a value to each loan. While the cash payments on the loans are contractual, the discount rate used and assumptions regarding the relative size of each class in the CMBS capital structure can significantly impact the valuation. Therefore, the estimates used could differ materially from the fair value determined when the loans are sold to a securitization trust. 
 Mortgage servicing rights - Financial Services records mortgage servicing rights when it sells loans on a servicing-retained basis or through the acquisition or assumption of the right to service a financial asset. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated using third-party valuations.

 Lennar Other investments available-for-sale - The fair value of investments available-for-sale is calculated from model-based techniques that use discounted cash flow assumptions and the Company s own estimates of CMBS spreads, market interest rate movements and the underlying loan credit quality. Loan values are calculated by allocating the change in value of an assumed CMBS capital structure to each loan. The value of an assumed CMBS capital structure is calculated, generally, by discounting the cash flows associated with each CMBS class at market interest rates and at the Company s own estimate of CMBS spreads.

 Finished homes and construction in progress are included within inventories. Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. The Company disclosed its accounting policy related to inventories and its review for indicators of impairment in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 The Company estimates the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause the Company to re-evaluate its strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and/or additional write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews its active communities for indicators of potential impairments.

 The Company disclosed its accounting policy related to investments in unconsolidated entities and its review for indicators of impairment for the long-lived assets of an unconsolidated entity and the decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023. 
 The Company evaluates if a decrease in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions, (3) the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost and (4) various other factors, which include age of the venture, relationships with the other partners and banks, general economic market conditions, land status, length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been below the carrying value, and liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity. The Company generally estimates the fair value of an investment in an unconsolidated entity by using a cash flow analysis for estimated future net distributions from an unconsolidated entity, subject to the perceived risks associated with the unconsolidated entity s cash flow streams. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, the Company evaluated the fair value of its investments in unconsolidated entities using a cash flow analysis and concluded that the investments had an immaterial amount of other-than-temporary impairment. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of an investment in an unconsolidated entity using a cash flow analysis with a discount rate and concluded that the investment had an other-than-temporary impairment of million included in Homebuilding other income (expense), net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive income.

 (1) As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure to loss of Homebuilding's investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to the Company's remaining commitment to fund capital in Upward America of million and million, respectively. In addition, as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, there was recourse debt of VIEs of million and million, respectively. 
 (2) As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure to loss of Multifamily's investments in unconsolidated VIEs was primarily limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs. The maximum exposure for LMV II, in addition to the investment, also included the remaining combined equity commitment of million as of November 30, 2023, for expenditures related to the construction and development of its projects. The decrease in exposure as of August 31, 2024 is primarily due to the removal of LMV II as the Fund does not expect to call for equity in the future. As a result, LMV II is not a VIE as of August 31, 2024. 
 (3) As of both August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure to loss of the Financial Services segment was limited to its investment in the unconsolidated VIEs and related to the Financial Services' CMBS investments held-to-maturity. 
 (4) As of both August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the Company's maximum recourse exposure to loss of the Lennar Other segment was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs. The increase in exposure was due to the Company entering into a new JV which is a VIE and its continued contributions to VIEs. 
 The Company and its JV partners generally fund JVs as needed and in accordance with business plans to allow the entities to finance their activities. Because such JVs are expected to make future capital calls in order to continue to finance their activities, the entities are determined to be VIEs as of August 31, 2024 in accordance with ASC 810 due to insufficient equity at risk. While these entities are VIEs, the Company has determined that the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance is generally shared and the Company and its partners are not de-facto agents. While the Company generally manages the day-to-day operations of the VIEs, each of these VIEs has an executive committee made up of representatives from each partner. The members of the executive committee have equal votes and major decisions require unanimous consent and approval from all members. The Company does not have the unilateral ability to exercise participating voting rights without partner consent. 
 There are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to the VIEs. Except for the unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, the Company and the other partners

 billion as of August 31, 2024 and is included in consolidated inventory not owned. Consolidated inventory not owned related to land financing transactions, which are land sale transactions that did not meet the criteria for revenue recognition and derecognition of land by the Company as a result of the Company maintaining an option to repurchase the land in the future, was billion as of August 31, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated inventory not owned increased by million with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to land financing transactions and the consolidation of homesites under option that the Company is economically compelled to takedown. These increases were partially offset by homesite takedowns. To reflect the purchase price of the homesite takedowns, the Company had a net reclass related to option deposits from consolidated inventory not owned to finished homes and construction in progress in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2024. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and the Company s cash deposits. 
 Non-refundable option deposits included in consolidated inventory not owned Letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2024, the Company purchased a significant portion of land from one land bank (the Land Bank ). There were no amounts due to the Land Bank as of August 31, 2024, resulting from land purchases as the full purchase price of the land is typically paid to the Land Bank at closing when land is purchased by the Company. As of August 31, 2024, the total deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate relating to contracts with the Land Bank were million. As of August 31, 2024, total consolidated inventory not owned and liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned relating to contracts with the Land Bank were million and million, respectively.

 In December 2023, the Company purchased its corporate headquarters building in which the Company had previously leased office space. This building contains approximately square feet of office space, of which the Company leases approximately square feet of unused office space to other tenants. On occasion, the Company may sublease other rented space which is no longer used for the Company's operations. For both the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an immaterial amount of sublease income.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. 
 
 Outlook 
 Overall, the economic environment remains very constructive for homebuilders. While affordability has been a limiting factor for demand and access to homeownership, and inflation and interest rates have hindered the ability of average families to accumulate a down payment to qualify for a mortgage, demand remains strong and the migration to lower interest rates may further activate that demand. Although there have been narratives around challenged consumer confidence, lower rates and controlled inflation should boost that confidence. Lower interest rates should enable many more households to access either first-time homeownership or a move-up purchase. Consumers are employed and are generally confident they will remain employed and believe their compensation will rise. This is most often the foundation of a strong housing market. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize, and now that the Fed has begun to cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated, and we are well prepared with growing community count and growing volume. 
 While demand should remain strong, the supply of homes remains constrained. The housing shortage is a result of years of under-production, exacerbated by continuing shortfalls in production driven by restrictive land permitting and higher impact fees at local levels, and by higher construction costs. Awareness about the need for affordable housing, attainable housing and workforce housing in local markets has begun to generate the first signs of action. Also, the influx of immigrant population has expanded the labor pool, which offsets the pressure on construction costs, while increasing demand for more dwellings. The road ahead appears positive for our homebuilding business. 
 Against that backdrop, we are adhering to our operating strategy focused on maintaining volume while we are sprinting towards the completion of our five-year marathon of migrating our operating platform from an asset-heavy model to a land-light, asset-light just-in-time finished homesite delivery model. As we have driven production pace, in sync with sales pace, we have used our margin as a point of adjustment to enable consistent production as market conditions have continued to adjust. During the third quarter, we pushed volume by increasing absorption levels in existing communities, which negatively impacted our gross margin. 
 In the near future, we expect to spin off a company that we call Millrose Properties Inc. ("Millrose"). The goal of the spin-off is to generally complete our migration to an asset-light operating model by spinning off much of our land assets from our balance sheet. We expect Millrose to qualify as a real estate investment trust that will acquire and develop land, and will deliver fully developed homesites under a land option contract on a just in time basis for Lennar and potentially other homebuilders. Millrose is expected to be a self-renewing, permanent source of land acquisition and development capital. We are going to contribute to Millrose, in exchange for its stock, essentially all of our undeveloped, partially developed, and some of our fully developed, land, as well as cash with an expected book value between 6.0 billion and 8.0 billion. As a result of the spin-off, both our inventory and our equity will be reduced by the amount of assets contributed to Millrose. However, our balance sheet will remain very strong after the spin-off and we expect to have ample funds with which to pay down debt and repurchase stock. 
 As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, given seasonality and customers adjusting to a changing interest rate environment, we are guiding to 22,500 to 23,000 closings next quarter, with a margin that is flat with the third quarter as customers build confidence in the changing economic and interest rate landscape. However, we expect our community count to exceed 1,400 by year-end 2024. We expect to deliver approximately 80,500 to 81,000 homes for the full fiscal 2024, a more than 10 increase over 2023. We expect that 10 growth to continue into 2025. 
 Lennar will also continue to focus on being a pure play business model and reduce its exposure to non-core assets. It will continue to allocate capital to growth, debt retirement and stock repurchases as appropriate. We expect to repurchase in excess of 2 billion of stock for fiscal year 2024. 
 As we look ahead to completing a successful 2024, we're well positioned for, and expect to see, much more of the same in the years ahead. We are confident that by design we will continue to grow, perform, and drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance.

(1) Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns. 
 Our net earnings attributable to Lennar were 1.2 billion, or 4.26 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net earnings attributable to Lennar of 1.1 billion, or 3.87 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding mark-to-market gains of 39 million on technology investments and one-time items of 89 million in our Multifamily segment, third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2024 were 1.1 billion, or 3.90 per diluted share. Excluding mark-to-market losses of 16 million on technology investments, third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2023 were 1.1 billion or 3.91 per diluted share.

 (1) During both the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, Multifamily revenues decreased primarily due to less general contractor and management fees income as a result of the completion of Multifamily properties. 
 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 versus Three Months Ended August 31, 2023 
 Revenues from home sales increased 9 in the third quarter of 2024 to 9.0 billion from 8.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 16 increase in the number of home deliveries, partially offset by a 6 decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 21,516 homes in the third quarter of 2024 from 18,559 homes in the third quarter of 2023. The average sales price of homes delivered was 422,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 448,000 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix. 
 Gross margins on home sales were 2.0 billion, or 22.5 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.0 billion, or 24.4 , in the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, gross margins decreased primarily because revenues per square foot decreased while land costs increased year over year, which was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot due to lower material costs as we continued to focus on construction cost savings. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 600.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 582.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.7 in the third quarter of 2024, from 7.0 in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in broker commissions and the benefits of our technology efforts. 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, our homebuilding operating earnings included 33.8 million of interest income, compared to 38.2 million of interest income in the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were 144.4 million 143.6 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 149.0 million 148.3 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower lock volume and margin in the mortgage business, partially offset by higher volume in the title business as a result of increased deliveries year over year. 
 Operating earnings for the Multifamily segment were 78.9 million 79.0 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of 8.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in operating earnings was due to a 179.0 million one-time net gain from the sale of assets in our LMV Fund I, partially offset by a one-time 90.0 million write-down of non-core assets as we focus on immediately monetizing these assets. Operating earnings for the Lennar Other segment were 20.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of 26.2 million in the 
 31 

third quarter of 2023. The Lennar Other operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to mark-to-market gains on our publicly traded technology investments. 
 In the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, we had tax provisions of 347.9 million and 358.2 million, respectively, which resulted in an overall effective income tax rate of 23.0 and 24.4 , respectively. For both periods, our effective income tax rate included state income tax expense and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by tax credits. In the three months ended August 31, 2024, our overall effective income tax rate was lower than last year primarily due to additional tax credits recognized during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended August 31, 2023 
 Revenues from home sales were 24.3 billion and 22.0 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 18 increase in the number of home deliveries, which was offset by a 6 decrease in average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 58,004 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 from 49,292 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The average sales price of homes delivered was 421,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 448,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to pricing to market through an increased use of incentives and product mix. 
 Gross margins on home sales were 5.4 billion, or 22.3 , in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 5.0 billion, or 22.9 , in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, gross margins decreased primarily because revenues per square foot decreased while land costs increased year over year, which was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot due to lower material costs as we continued to focus on construction cost savings. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1.8 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 1.5 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.4 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, from 7.0 in the nine months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in digital marketing and advertising costs to generate more direct sales, professional expenses and insurance costs. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, our homebuilding operating earnings included 134.6 million of interest income due to an increase in cash balances and higher interest rates. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, our homebuilding operating earnings included 102.7 million of interest income, which was partially offset by an impairment of 36.8 million of an investment in a joint venture. 
 Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were 422.7 million 420.5 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 340.3 million 338.7 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher volume from increased capture rate and Lennar deliveries in the mortgage business. There was also an increase in profitability in our title business primarily due to benefits of our technology efforts. 
 Operating earnings for the Multifamily segment were 42.8 million 43.1 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to an operating loss of 38.5 million 38.4 million net of noncontrolling interests) in the nine months ended August 31, 2023.

Operating loss for the Lennar Other segment was 47.3 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to operating loss of 85.8 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The Lennar Other operating loss for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was primarily related to operating losses from certain strategic investments, which was partially offset by 12.5 million of mark-to-market gains on our publicly traded technology investments and a 46.5 million one-time gain on the sale of a technology investment. Lennar Other operating loss in the nine months ended August 31, 2023 was primarily related to operating losses from certain strategic investments. 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, we had tax provisions of 859.2 million and 824.2 million, respectively, which resulted in overall effective income tax rates of 23.2 and 24.2 , respectively. For both periods, our effective income tax rate included state income tax expense and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by tax credits.

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by sales deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. Various state and federal laws and regulations may sometimes give purchasers a right to cancel contracts homes in backlog. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. 
 Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 versus Three Months Ended August 31, 2023

 Financial Services Segment 
 Our Financial Services reportable segment provides mortgage financing, title and closing services primarily for buyers of our homes. The segment also originates and sells into securitizations commercial mortgage loans through its LMF Commercial business. Our Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the residential loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements.

Multifamily Segment 
 We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated funds and joint ventures, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. 
 The following table provides information related to our investment in the Multifamily segment:

 Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund I LMV I") is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. As of November 30, 2023, there were 38 rental operation projects in LMV I. During the second half of fiscal 2024, the LMV I partners decided to liquidate and sell all of the individual rental operation projects of LMV I as the fund has come to the end of its contractual life. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, 27 LMV I rental operation projects were sold to various third-party buyers. We recognized a net gain of 179.0 million on the sale of these rental operation projects which was recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we received net cash distributions of 147.3 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024. The remaining LMV I rental operation projects are expected to be monetized in the near term. 
 Lennar Other Segment 
 Our Lennar Other segment includes fund investments we retained subsequent to our sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform, as well as strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had 854.3 million and 657.9 million, respectively, of assets in our Lennar Other segment, which included investments in unconsolidated entities of 351.2 million and 276.2 million, respectively.

 (2) Financial Condition and Capital Resources 
 At August 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash related to our homebuilding, financial services, multifamily and other operations of 4.3 billion, compared to 6.6 billion at November 30, 2023 and 4.1 billion at August 31, 2023. 
 We finance all of our activities, including homebuilding, financial services, multifamily, other and general operating needs, primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit and our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ). At August 31, 2024, we had 4.0 billion of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our 2.2 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing approximately 6.2 billion of available capacity. 
 Operating Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, cash provided by operating activities totaled 1.4 billion and 2.6 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was impacted 
 38 

primarily by our net earnings and a decrease in loans held-for-sale of 245 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment. This was offset by an increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases, land development and construction costs of 708 million, an increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate of 985 million as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites, and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of 176 million. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was impacted primarily by our net earnings, a decrease in loans held-for-sale of 434 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment and a decrease in receivables of 168 million primarily related to a decrease in Financial Services receivables, net, which are loans sold to investors for which we have not yet been paid. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of 882 million, primarily due to the payment of income taxes and an increase in other assets of 105 million. 
 Investing Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities totaled 177 million and 115 million, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of 312 million to unconsolidated entities, which included (1) 164 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) 131 million to Lennar other unconsolidated entities and (3) 17 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities and 130 million of net additions of operating properties and equipment. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of 237 million, which primarily included (1) 53 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) 18 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities and (3) 166 million from Multifamily entities. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of 153 million to unconsolidated entities, which included (1) 75 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) 58 million to Lennar Other unconsolidated entities, and (3) 20 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of 70 million, which primarily included (1) 48 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) 21 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities, and (3) 1 million from Multifamily entities. 
 Financing Cash Flow Activities 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, cash used in financing activities totaled 3.5 billion and 3.2 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to (1) 618 million of net repayments under our Financial Services' warehouse facilities; (2) redemption of 454 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.50 senior notes due April 2024; (3) 100 million of partial repurchase of our 4.75 senior notes due 2027; (4) 1.7 billion of repurchases of our common stock, which included 1.6 billion of repurchases under our repurchase program and 86 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan; (5) 414 million of dividend payments; and (6) 125 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to activity with land banks. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to (1) 981 million of net repayments under our Financial Services' warehouse facilities; (2) 842 million of repurchases of our common stock, which included 769 million of repurchases under our repurchase program and 72 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan; (3) the early redemption of 425 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875 senior notes due November 2024; (4) 208 million of repurchases of our senior notes due in fiscal year 2024; (5) 325 million of dividend payments; and (6) 256 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to activity with land banks. 
 Debt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) August 31, 2024 November 30, 2023 August 31, 2023 Homebuilding debt 2,263,256 2,816,482 3,320,119 Stockholders equity 27,412,520 26,580,664 25,656,619 Total capital 29,675,776 29,397,146 28,976,738 Homebuilding debt to total capital 7.6 9.6 11.5 Homebuilding debt 2,263,256 2,816,482 3,320,119 Less: Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents 4,037,405 6,273,724 3,887,809 Net Homebuilding debt (1,774,149) (3,457,242) (567,690) Net Homebuilding debt to total capital (1) (6.9) (15.0) (2.3) 
 (1) Net homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). We believe the ratio 
 39 

of net homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in homebuilding operations. However, because net homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results. 
 At August 31, 2024, Homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to both November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in stockholders' equity due to net earnings and a decrease in Homebuilding debt due to debt paydowns, partially offset by share repurchases. 
 We are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness, the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock, strategic transactions to accelerate our land light strategy or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and/or the pursuit of other financing alternatives. In connection with some of our non-homebuilding businesses, we are also considering other types of transactions such as sales, restructurings, joint ventures, spin-offs or initial public offerings as we continue to move back towards being a pure play homebuilding company. 
 Subject to market conditions, we are planning a strategic taxable spin-off of a new public company to which we will have contributed land as well as cash with a value of approximately 6 billion to 8 billion. We have confidentially submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission a draft registration statement relating to the spin-off and are actively engaged with the Securities and Exchange Commission in their review process. This project is ongoing and while we aim to work efficiently to consummate the transaction in the near term, there is no guarantee that the transaction will be completed on any given timeline. We expect the new company to qualify as a real estate investment trust and to operate as a permanent capital vehicle that will acquire and develop homesites and give options to acquire them on a just-in-time basis for Lennar and other customers. The goal of the spin-off is to accelerate our land light strategy by removing much of the land assets from our balance sheet. 
 Our Homebuilding senior notes and other debt payable as well as letters of credit and surety bonds are summarized within Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Homebuilding average debt outstanding and the average rates of interest was as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Homebuilding average debt outstanding 2,512,139 3,890,590 Average interest rate 4.8 4.9 Interest incurred 100,056 146,206

The maturity, debt covenants and details of the Credit Facility are unchanged from the disclosure in our Financial Condition and Capital Resources section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. In addition to the Credit Facility, we have other letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions. 
 40 

Under the agreement governing our Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. These ratios are calculated per the Credit Facility agreement, which involves adjustments to GAAP financial measures. We believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2024. The following summarizes our debt covenant requirements and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement as of August 31, 2024: (Dollars in thousands) Covenant Level Level Achieved as of August 31, 2024 Minimum net worth test 13,966,671 20,791,911 Maximum leverage ratio 65.0 (4.9) Liquidity test 1.00 (134.00) 
 Financial Services Warehouse Facilities 
 Our Financial Services segment uses residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities to finance its residential lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. The LMF Commercial warehouse facilities finance LMF Commercial loan origination and securitization activities and are secured by up to 80 interests in the originated commercial loans financed. These facilities and the related borrowings and collateral are detailed in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Changes in Capital Structure 
 In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program to enable us to repurchase up to an additional 5 billion in value of our outstanding Class A or Class B common stock. Repurchases are authorized to be made in open-market or private transactions. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. At August 31 2024, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase 3.9 billion in value of our Class A or B common stock. The details of our Class A and Class B common stock repurchases under the authorized repurchase program for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 are included in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, treasury shares increased by 11.2 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 10.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, treasury shares increased by 7.8 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 7.0 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program. 
 On September 25, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.50 per share on both our Class A and Class B common stock, payable on October 24, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2024. On July 19, 2024, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.50 per share for both of its Class A and Class B common stock to holders of record at the close of business on July 5, 2024, as declared by its Board of Directors on June 20, 2024. We approved and paid cash dividends of 0.375 per share for each of the four quarters of 2023 on both our Class A and Class B common stock. 
 Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity. 
 
 Supplemental Financial Information 
 Currently, certain of our 100 owned subsidiaries, which are primarily homebuilding subsidiaries, are guaranteeing all our senior notes. The guarantees are full and unconditional. 
 The indentures governing our senior notes require that, if any of our 100 owned subsidiaries, other than our finance company subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries, directly or indirectly guarantee at least 75 million principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation (other than senior notes), those subsidiaries must also guarantee Lennar Corporation s obligations with regard to its senior notes. Included in the following tables as part of Obligors together with Lennar Corporation are subsidiary entities that are not finance company subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and were guaranteeing the senior notes because at August 31, 2024 they were guaranteeing Lennar Corporation's letter of credit facilities and its Credit Facility, disclosed in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100 directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. A subsidiary's guarantee of Lennar senior notes will be suspended at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least 75 million principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation (other than senior notes), and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed. 
 Supplemental information for the Obligors, which excludes non-guarantor subsidiaries and intercompany transactions, at August 31, 2024 is included in the following tables. Intercompany balances and transactions within the Obligors have been 
 41 

eliminated and amounts attributable to the Obligors' investment in consolidated subsidiaries that have not issued or guaranteed the senior notes have been excluded. Amounts due from and transactions with nonobligor subsidiaries and related parties are separately disclosed:

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We regularly monitor the results of our Homebuilding, Multifamily and Lennar Other unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investments. We believe that substantially all of the joint ventures were in compliance with applicable debt covenants at August 31, 2024. 
 Homebuilding: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had equity investments in 49 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 5 had recourse debt, 14 had non-recourse debt and 30 had no debt) and 48 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2023. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partners. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners. Details regarding these investments, balances and debt are included in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Homebuilding unconsolidated entities JVs debt as per current debt arrangements as of August 31, 2024. It does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

 We own an approximately 40 interest in FivePoint Holdings, LLC., a NYSE listed company, and companies it manages, which own three large multi-use properties in California. 
 We manage, and have an investment in, Upward America Fund, which purchases single family homes and operates them as rental properties. 
 42 

Multifamily: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
 At August 31, 2024, Multifamily had equity investments in 22 active unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 18 had non-recourse debt and 4 had no debt) and 22 active unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2023. We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Initially, we participated in building multifamily developments and selling them soon after they were completed. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners. 
 The Multifamily segment includes LMV I, LMV II and Canada Pension Plan Investments Fund, which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the LMV I fund sold some of its individual rental operation projects which resulted in a net gain of 179.0 million and received net cash distributions of 147.3 million. The remaining LMV I rental operation projects are expected to be monetized in the near term. Combined, these transactions could result in cash proceeds of approximately 250 million. Details of each fund as of and during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 are included in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of August 31, 2024. It does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.

 Lennar Other: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
 As part of the sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform, we retained the right to receive a portion of payments with regard to carried interests if certain funds meet specified performance thresholds. We periodically receive advance distributions related to the carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to the carried interests. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks but reduce future carried interest payments to which we become entitled from the applicable funds and are recorded as equity in earnings (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Our investment in the Rialto funds totaled 145.7 million and 148.7 million as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. 
 As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had strategic technology investments in unconsolidated entities of 205.5 million and 127.5 million, respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our strategic technology investments through our LEN X business help to enhance the homebuying and home ownership experience, and help us stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Details regarding these investments are included in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Option Contracts 
 We often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land banks) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options. Since fiscal year 2020, we have been increasing the percentage of our total homesites that we control through option contracts rather than own. 
 43 

The table below indicates the number of homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated JVs (i.e., controlled homesites) and homesites owned (excluding homes in inventory): Years of August 31, 2024 Controlled Homesites Owned Homesites Total Homesites Supply Owned (1) East 90,809 18,574 109,383 Central 89,055 28,386 117,441 Texas 107,395 16,645 124,040 West 77,239 21,152 98,391 Other 4,828 1,891 6,719 Total homesites 369,326 86,648 455,974 1.1 of total homesites 81 19 Years of August 31, 2023 Controlled Homesites Owned Homesites Total Homesites Supply Owned (1) East 83,102 21,929 105,031 Central 55,650 35,073 90,723 Texas 77,866 24,946 102,812 West 61,721 23,176 84,897 Other 5,411 1,891 7,302 Total homesites 283,750 107,015 390,765 1.5 of total homesites 73 27

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, debt obligations, loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment. We utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage loan portfolio. Since November 30, 2023, there have been no material changes in market risk exposures associated with interest rate risk. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 As of August 31, 2024, our borrowings under Financial Services' warehouse repurchase facilities totaled 1.3 billion under residential facilities and 83.9 million under LMF Commercial facilities.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and President (together, Co-CEOs and our Chief Financial Officer CFO participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our Co-CEOs and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including both of our Co-CEOs and our CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Both of our Co-CEOs and our CFO also participated in an evaluation by our management of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024. That evaluation did not identify any changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 45 

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are party to various claims and lawsuits relating to homes we sold which arise in the ordinary course of business, but we do not consider the volume of our claims and lawsuits unusual given the number of homes we deliver and the fact that the lawsuits often relate to homes delivered several years before the lawsuits are commenced. Although the specific allegations in the lawsuits differ, they most commonly involve claims that we failed to construct homes in particular communities in accordance with plans and specifications or applicable construction codes and seek reimbursement for sums allegedly needed to remedy the alleged deficiencies, assert contract issues or relate to personal injuries. Lawsuits of these types are common within the homebuilding industry. We are a plaintiff in a number of cases in which we seek contribution from our subcontractors for home repair costs. The costs incurred by us in construction defect lawsuits may be offset by warranty reserves, our third-party insurers, subcontractor insurers or indemnity contributions from subcontractors. From time to time, we are also a party to lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These lawsuits often include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of the property and disputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell the property. From time-to-time, we also receive notices from environmental agencies or other regulators regarding alleged violations of environmental or other laws. We typically settle all of the foregoing matters before they reach litigation for amounts that are not material to us. 
 We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These risks are described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, or in our other filings with the SEC, including Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in those reports, other than the impact of inflation and increased interest rates, which are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 The following table provides information about our repurchases of common stock during the three months ended August 31, 2024: 
 Period: Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (2) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that may yet be Purchased under the Plans or Programs (2) June 1 to June 30, 2024 1,031,441 149.98 1,031,039 4,304,199 July 1 to July 31, 2024 1,213,476 147.35 1,213,476 4,126,323 August 1 to August 31, 2024 1,110,711 167.31 1,110,711 3,938,433
