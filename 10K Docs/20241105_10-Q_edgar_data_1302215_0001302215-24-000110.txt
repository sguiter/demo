 business segments: 
 
 Corporate Finance ("CF") provides general financial advisory services and advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions, including financial sponsors, on a wide variety of matters, including buy-side and sell-side M A transactions, debt and equity financings in both the private and public markets, and other corporate finance transactions. The majority of our CF revenues consists of fees paid upon the successful completion of the transaction or engagement ("Completion Fees"). A CF transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the fees paid at the time an engagement letter is signed ("Retainer Fees") and in some cases fees paid during the course of the engagement ("Progress Fees") that may have been received. 
 
 Financial Restructuring ("FR") provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented through bankruptcy proceedings and out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our FR business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; liability management transactions; corporate viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor-in-possession financing. Although atypical, FR transactions can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees. 
 
 Financial and Valuation Advisory ("FVA") primarily provides financial advisory and valuation services with respect to companies, debt and equity interests (including complex illiquid investments), and other types of assets and liabilities; fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions; as well as diligence, tax, transaction accounting, and other financial advisory services to companies, boards of directors, special committees, retained counsel, financial and strategic investors, trustees, and other parties. Also, our FVA business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Unlike our CF or FR segments, the fees generated in our FVA segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction.

 Note 2 
 
 In connection with certain acquisitions, select employees may be entitled to deferred consideration, primarily in the form of retention payments, contingent upon the fulfillment of specific service and/or performance conditions in the future. Accordingly, such deferred consideration is expensed as Acquisition related compensation and benefits in current and future periods. Historically, such Acquisition related compensation and benefits were included as a component of Employee compensation and benefits within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Beginning with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management has deemed it beneficial for stakeholders to separately disclose Acquisition related compensation and benefits and Employee compensation and benefits within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to this new presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, stockholders' equity, or cash flows as previously reported. 
 business segments (CF, FR, and FVA) are recognized upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, which may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement.

 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of million. As of September 30, 2023, we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of million and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the euro and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of million.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement : 
 
 Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. 
 For Level 3 investments in which pricing inputs are unobservable and limited market activity exists, management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available, and may incorporate management's own assumptions or involve a significant degree of judgment. 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures: 
 Corporate debt securities: All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management. 
 U.S. treasury securities: Fair values for U.S. treasury securities are based on quoted prices from recent trading activity of identical or similar securities. All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given investment is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. 
 The fair values of the financial instruments represent the amounts that would be received to sell assets or that would be paid to transfer liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of a specified date. Fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs; however, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances, including expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, as well as available observable and unobservable inputs. 
 The carrying value of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Accounts receivable, Unbilled work in progress, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and Deferred income approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may, might, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, intends, predicts, potential or continue, the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, the factors listed under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 (the 2024 Annual Report ). Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.

 Key Financial Measures 
 Revenues 
 Revenues include fee revenues and reimbursements of expenses (see Note 2 and Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information). Revenues reflect revenues from our Corporate Finance CF ), Financial Restructuring FR ), and Financial and Valuation Advisory FVA business segments that substantially consist of fees for advisory services. 
 
 Revenues for all three business segments are recognized upon satisfaction of the performance obligation and may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement. In general, advisory fees are paid at the time an engagement letter is signed Retainer Fees ), during the course of the engagement Progress Fees ), or upon the successful completion of a transaction or engagement Completion Fees ). 
 
 CF provides general financial advisory services and advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions, including financial sponsors, on a wide variety of matters, including buy-side and sell-side M A transactions, debt and equity financings in both the private and public markets, and other corporate finance transactions. The majority of our CF revenues consists of Completion Fees. A CF transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to Retainer Fees and in some cases Progress Fees that may have been received. 
 
 FR provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented through bankruptcy proceedings and out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our FR business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; liability management transactions; corporate viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor-in-possession financing. Although atypical, FR transactions can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees. 
 
 FVA primarily provides financial advisory and valuation services with respect to companies, debt and equity interests (including complex illiquid investments), and other types of assets and liabilities; fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions; as well as diligence, tax, transaction accounting, and other financial advisory services to companies, boards of directors, special committees, retained counsel, financial and strategic investors, trustees, and other parties. Also, our FVA business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Unlike our CF or FR segments, the fees generated in our FVA segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction.

Table of Contents 

 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are classified as employee compensation and benefits expense and non-compensation expense; revenue and headcount are the primary drivers of our operating expenses. Reimbursements of certain out-of-pocket deal expenses are recorded on a gross basis and are therefore included in both Revenues and Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense . Our employee compensation and benefits expense, which accounts for the majority of our operating expenses, is determined by management based on revenues earned, headcount, the competitiveness of the prevailing labor market, and anticipated compensation expectations of our employees. These factors may fluctuate, and as a result, our employee compensation and benefits expense may fluctuate materially in any particular period. Accordingly, the amount of employee compensation and benefits expense recognized in any particular period may not be consistent with prior periods or indicative of future periods. 
 
 Our employee compensation and benefits expense consists of base salary, payroll taxes, benefits, annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards, deferred cash bonus awards, and the amortization of equity-based bonus awards. Base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year. Our annual equity-based bonus awards include fixed share compensation awards and liability classified fixed dollar awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees. These equity awards are generally subject to annual vesting requirements over a four-year period beginning at the date of grant, which typically occurs in the first quarter of each fiscal year; accordingly, expenses are amortized over the stated vesting period. In most circumstances, the unvested portion of these awards is subject to forfeiture should the employee depart from the Company, and in certain cases if certain financial metrics are not met. Cash bonuses, which are accrued monthly, are discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors including the Company's performance and are generally paid in the first quarter of each fiscal year with respect to prior year performance. Generally, a portion of the cash bonus is deferred and paid in the third quarter of the fiscal year in which the bonus is awarded. We refer to the ratio of our employee compensation and benefits expenses to our revenues as our Compensation Ratio. 
 
 Non-Compensation Expense . The balance of our operating expenses includes costs for travel, meals and entertainment, rent, depreciation and amortization, information technology and communications, professional fees, and other operating expenses. We refer to all of these expenses as non-compensation expenses. A portion of our non-compensation expenses fluctuates in response to changes in headcount. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net includes (i) interest income earned on non-marketable and investment securities, cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable from affiliates, employee loans, and commercial paper, (ii) interest expense and fees on our HLI Line of Credit (defined herein), (iii) equity income and/or gains or losses from funds and partnership interests where we have had more than a minor ownership interest or more than minor influence over operations, but do not have a controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, (iv) gains and/or losses associated with the reduction/increase of earnout liabilities, and (v) other miscellaneous non-operating expenses.

 Revenues for FVA were 79.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 70.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 12 . Revenues increased due to an increase in the number of Fee Events and an increase in the average fee per Fee Event, driven by improvements in the M A markets, which impacted one or more of the service lines within our FVA business. 
 
 Segment profit for FVA remained relatively flat at 19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues for FVA were 147.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 136.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 8 . The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of Fee Events, driven by improvements in the M A markets, which impacted one or more of the service lines within our FVA business. 
 
 Segment profit for FVA was 37.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 34.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7 .

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our current assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable, and unbilled work in progress related to fees earned from providing advisory services. Our current liabilities include deferred income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued salaries and bonuses, income taxes payable, and current portion of loan obligations. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks. We maintain moderate levels of cash on hand in support of regulatory requirements for our registered broker-dealer. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 457.0 million and 545.0 million of cash in foreign subsidiaries, respectively. Our excess cash may be invested from time to time in short-term investments, including treasury securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and investment grade corporate and government debt securities. Please refer to Note 6 for further detail. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, our restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, and investment securities were as follows: 
 (In thousands) 
 September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 691,410 721,235 Investment securities 56,829 38,005 Total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, including investment securities 748,239 759,240 Restricted cash (1) 
 1,452 619 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, including investment securities 749,691 759,859 
 (1) Restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 consisted of cash deposits in support of two letters of credit for our Frankfurt office. Restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 also includes cash held in escrow accounts. 
 
 Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients that are generally dependent upon the successful completion of transactions, as well as the timing of receivables collections, which typically occur within 60 days of billing. As of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable, net of credit losses was 219.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, unbilled work in progress, net of credit losses was 138.3 million. 
 
 On August 23, 2019, the Company entered into a syndicated revolving line of credit with the Bank of America, N.A. and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which was amended by a First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 2, 2022 (the "HLI Line of Credit"), which allows for borrowings of up to 100 million (and, subject to certain conditions, provides the Company with an uncommitted expansion option, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of 200 million), and matures on August 23, 2025 (or if such date is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day). Borrowings under the HLI Line of Credit bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either, at the Company s option, (i) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a 0.10 SOFR adjustment plus a 1.00 margin or (ii) base rate, which is the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent (0.50 ), (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its prime rate, and (c) Term SOFR plus a 0.10 SOFR adjustment. Commitment fees apply to unused amounts, and the HLI Line of Credit contains debt covenants which require that the Company maintain certain financial ratios. The loan agreement requires compliance with certain loan covenants including but not limited to the maintenance of minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of no less than 150 million as of the end of any quarterly 12-month period and certain leverage ratios including a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 2.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, we were, and expect to continue to be, in compliance with such covenants. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, no principal was outstanding under the HLI Line of Credit. 
 
 The majority of the Company's payment obligations and commitments pertain to routine operating leases. The Company also has various obligations relating to notes payable and contingent consideration issued in connection with businesses previously acquired (see Note 10 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). 
 
 In connection with certain acquisitions, certain employees may be entitled to deferred consideration, primarily in the form of retention payments, should certain service and/or performance conditions be met in the future. As a result of these conditions, such deferred consideration would be expensed as compensation in current and future periods and has been accrued as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.

 Cash Flows 
 Our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the amount and timing of receipt of advisory fees and the payment of operating expenses, including payments of incentive compensation to our employees. We pay a significant portion of our incentive compensation during the first and third quarters of each fiscal year. A summary of our operating, investing, and financing cash flows is as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 
 2024 2023 Change 
 Operating activities: Net income 182,489 128,421 42 Non-cash charges 119,716 113,209 6 Other operating activities (77,494) (239,378) (68) Net cash provided by operating activities 224,711 2,252 9,878 Net cash used in investing activities (71,311) (32,974) 116 Net cash used in financing activities (200,626) (178,833) 12 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 18,234 (10,955) (266) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (28,992) (220,510) (87) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash beginning of period 721,854 714,812 1 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash end of period 692,862 494,302 40 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of 224.7 million, primarily attributable to net income plus equity and liability classified share awards issued, partially offset by cash bonus payments paid in May, 2024. Investing activities resulted in a net outflow of (71.3) million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Triago during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and the purchase of investment securities and property and equipment, net. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of (200.6) million, primarily attributable to payments made to settle employee tax obligations on share-based awards and dividends paid. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of 2.3 million, primarily attributable to net income plus equity and liability classified share awards issued, almost entirely offset by cash bonus payments paid in May, 2023. Investing activities resulted in a net outflow of (33.0) million, primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment, net. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of (178.8) million, primarily attributable to dividends paid and payments made to settle employee tax obligations on share-based awards. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our known contractual obligations, which are included in Item 7 of our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period for which they are determined to be necessary. 
 Business Combinations 
 Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, geographic risk premiums, discount rates, and more. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. 
 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 For information on recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market Risk and Credit Risk 
 Our business is not capital intensive and we generally do not issue debt or invest in derivative instruments. As a result, we are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk) or credit risk (except in relation to receivables). We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings. Although these deposits are generally not insured, management believes we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, pound sterling and euros, and we face foreign currency risk in our cash balances and other assets and liabilities held in accounts outside the U.S. due to potential currency movements and the associated foreign currency translation accounting requirements. 
 
 We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable and recoverable expense balances, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay such amounts owed to us. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred. 
 
 Risks Related to Cash and Short-Term Investments 
 Our cash is maintained in U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts. We have exposure to foreign exchange risks through all of our international affiliates and through some of our investments. However, we believe our cash is not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk. Consistent with our past practice, we expect to maintain our cash in bank accounts or highly liquid securities. 
 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate may have an effect on the reported value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities and, therefore, be reflected as a change in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Our non-U.S. assets and liabilities that are sensitive to exchange rates consist primarily of trade payables and receivables, work in progress, and cash. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income was 31,361 and (19,883), respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income was 28,399 and (16,909), respectively. 
 
 In addition, the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate and the United States dollar, affecting our operating results. We have analyzed our potential exposure to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro, the primary currencies of our European operations, by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income, and determined that while our earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency rates, at this time we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect. 
 From time to time, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. As of September 30, 2024, we had two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of 37.0 million. As of September 30, 2023, we had three foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of 35.2 million and two foreign currency forward contracts outstanding between the euro and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of 9.4 million. The change in fair value of these contracts represented a net gain/(loss) included in Other operating expenses of 2,410 and (1,217) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 In summary, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and the potential impact of future currency fluctuation will increase as our international expansion continues. The magnitude of this impact will depend on the timing and volume of revenues and expenses of, and the amounts of assets and liabilities in, our foreign subsidiaries along with the timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting performed during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. There has been no material change in the nature of our legal proceedings from the descriptions contained in our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report.
