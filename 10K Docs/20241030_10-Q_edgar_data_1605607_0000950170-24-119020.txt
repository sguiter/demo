(1) At September 30, 2024, our basis in the joint ventures that own 712 Fifth Avenue, Market Center and 111 Sutter Street were negative. Since we have no further obligation to fund additional capital to these joint ventures, we have discontinued the equity method of accounting, and accordingly, we no longer recognize our proportionate share of earnings. Instead, we recognize income only to the extent we receive cash distributions from the joint ventures and recognize losses to the extent we make cash contributions to the joint ventures. 

 (2) As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our investments in 55 Second Street, 1600 Broadway, One Steuart Lane and Oder-Center, Germany was greater than our share of equity in these investments by , , and , respectively, and primarily represents the unamortized portion of our capitalized acquisition costs. 

 (3) In the second quarter of 2023, the joint venture recognized a real estate impairment loss. Accordingly, we recognized a impairment loss on our investment in 60 Wall Street. This impairment, together with our share of operating losses recognized in that quarter, reduced our investment balance below zero as of June 30, 2023. As a result, in the second quarter of 2023, we discontinued the equity method of accounting. In the first quarter of 2024, the non-recourse mortgage loan was modified and the joint venture committed to fund the development costs related to the project. As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we resumed the equity method of accounting and recognized all previously deferred losses.

The existing 975,000,000 loan, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.03 , was scheduled to mature on February 6, 2024. In connection with the modification, the loan balance was reduced to 850,000,000, following a 125,000,000 paydown by the joint venture, of which our 49.0 share was 61,250,000. The modified loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.08 , matures in February 2027 and has an option to extend for an additional year, subject to certain conditions. 
 
 On March 29, 2024, the joint venture that owns 60 Wall Street, in which we have a 5.0 ownership interest, modified the existing 575,000,000 non-recourse mortgage loan and extended the maturity to May 2029. In connection with the modification, the loan was split into (i) a 316,250,000 A-Note that bears interest at Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 245 basis points, of which 4.0 is current pay and the remaining is accrued, and (ii) a 258,750,000 B-Note that accrues interest at 12.0 . The joint venture plans to redevelop the property and all amounts funded by the joint venture will be senior to the B-Note and all accrued interest. 
 
 On April 30, 2024, the joint venture that owns 111 Sutter Street, in which we have a 49.0 ownership interest, modified the existing 164,775,000 non-recourse mortgage loan to extend the maturity date to December 2025. The loan bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus 215 basis points and all interest shortfalls will continue to accrue to the principal balance of the loan. 
 
 On August 13, 2024, the joint venture that owns Market Center, in which we have a 67.0 ownership interest, defaulted on the 416,544,000 non-recourse mortgage loan securing the property. The loan bears interest at SOFR plus 161 basis points and is scheduled to mature in January 2025. 

Transfer Tax Assessments 
 
 During 2017, the New York City Department of Finance NYCDOF issued Notices of Determination Notices assessing additional transfer taxes (including interest and penalties) in connection with the transfer of interests in certain properties during our 2014 initial public offering IPO ). We disagreed with the assessment and strongly contested the Notices. While we estimated that the range of loss from these Notices could be between 0 and 62,500,000, we concluded, after consultation with legal counsel, that it was not possible to predict any estimate within that range and as such we did not accrue any liability in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that may arise relating to such Notices. In February 2024, the NYCDOF completed its assessment and concluded that no additional taxes were due. 

Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 We currently have 15,000,000 of capacity under a 200,000,000 stock repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors in November 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases, if any, will depend on a number of factors, including, the price and availability of our shares, trading volume, general market conditions and available funding. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

 Income tax expense was 619,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 263,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 356,000. This increase resulted primarily from higher taxable income attributable to our taxable REIT subsidiaries in the current year. 

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Joint Ventures 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures was 6,959,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,887,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 2,072,000 increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures.

This decrease in loss was primarily due to the noncontrolling interests share of 23,942,000 of impairment loss related to residential condominium units at One Steuart Lane in the prior year. 

Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Operating Partnership 
 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership was 893,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 629,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in net loss allocated to noncontrolling interests of 264,000. This increase in loss resulted from higher net loss subject to allocation to the unitholders of the Operating Partnership in the current year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.24 billion of liquidity comprised of 318,725,000 of cash and cash equivalents, 173,510,000 of restricted cash and 750,000,000 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 We expect that these sources will provide adequate liquidity over the next 12 months for all anticipated needs, including scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, existing and anticipated capital improvements, the cost of securing new and renewal leases, any dividends to stockholders and distributions to unitholders, and all other capital needs related to the operations of our business. 
 
 We anticipate that our long-term needs including debt maturities and potential acquisitions will be funded by operating cash flow, third-party joint venture capital, mortgage financings and/or re-financings, and the issuance of long-term debt or equity and cash on hand. Although we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain of our liquidity needs, unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which affect our financial condition and results of operations may arise, or our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or required. 

Consolidated Debt 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding consolidated debt aggregated 3.69 billion. We had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and none of our debt matures until June 2026. We may refinance any of our maturing debt when it comes due or repay it early depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 Our 750,000,000 revolving credit facility matures in March 2026 and has two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the facility is 135 basis points over SOFR with adjustments based on the terms of advances, plus a facility fee of 20 basis points. The facility also features a sustainability-linked pricing component such that if we meet certain sustainability performance targets, the applicable per annum interest rate will be reduced by one basis point. The facility contains certain restrictions and covenants that require us to maintain, on an ongoing basis, (i) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60 , which may be increased to 65 for any fiscal quarter in which an acquisition of real estate is completed, and for up to the next three subsequent consecutive fiscal quarters, (ii) a secured leverage ratio not to exceed 50 , (iii) a fixed coverage ratio of at least 1.50, (iv) an unsecured leverage ratio to not to exceed 60 , which may be increased to 65 for any fiscal quarter in which an acquisition of real estate is completed, and for up to the next three subsequent consecutive fiscal quarters and (v) an unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75. The facility also contains customary representations and warranties, limitations on permitted investments and other covenants. 

Dividend Policy 
 
 In September 2024, we suspended our regular quarterly dividend. During 2024, we paid three regular quarterly dividends aggregating 0.1050 per share of common stock, which we believe is sufficient to meet our annual REIT distribution requirement. The decision by our board of directors to suspend our regular quarterly dividend aligns with our commitment to fortify our balance sheet and maintain the utmost financial flexibility. The timing and frequency of future dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial performance, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditure requirements, the requirements to maintain our qualification as a REIT and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. 
 45 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our unconsolidated joint ventures had 1.78 billion of outstanding indebtedness, of which our share was 633,938,000. On August 13, 2024, the joint venture that owns Market Center, in which we have a 67.0 ownership interest, defaulted on the 416,544,000 non-recourse mortgage loan securing the property. The loan bears interest at SOFR plus 161 basis points and is scheduled to mature in January 2025. We do not guarantee the indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures other than providing customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of specified non-recourse carve outs relating to specified covenants and representations; however, we may elect to fund additional capital to a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans in order to enable the joint venture to repay this indebtedness upon maturity. 

Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 We currently have 15,000,000 of capacity under a 200,000,000 stock repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors in November 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases, if any, will depend on a number of factors, including, the price and availability of our shares, trading volume, general market conditions and available funding. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

Insurance 
 
 We carry commercial general liability coverage on our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct and indirect physical damage to our properties including coverage for perils such as floods, earthquakes and windstorms. Our policies also cover the loss of rental income during an estimated reconstruction period. Our policies reflect limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to our buildings and portfolio. We also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties. We currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities, as well as cybersecurity incidents. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance, terrorism insurance and cybersecurity insurance, these policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, there are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from known environmental conditions or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in consultation with our insurance advisors, we believe the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. 

Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 We are a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims or others to which we may be subject from time to time may result in defense costs, settlements, fines or judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, covered by insurance. Payment of any such costs, settlements, fines or judgments that are not insured could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Should any litigation arise, we would contest it vigorously. In addition, certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and/or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors. 
 
 The terms of our consolidated mortgage debt agreements in place include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, certain investments, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens and the disposition or other transfer of assets and interests in the borrower and other credit parties, and require compliance with certain debt yield, debt service coverage and loan to value ratios. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains representations, warranties, covenants, other agreements and events of default customary for agreements of this type with comparable companies. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we are in compliance with all of our covenants. 
 
 On March 29, 2024, the joint venture that owns 60 Wall Street, in which we have a 5.0 ownership interest, modified the existing 575,000,000 non-recourse mortgage loan and extended the maturity to May 2029. In connection with the modification, the joint venture committed to redevelop the property and fund the necessary costs to complete the project. On behalf of the joint venture, we have provided the lender with certain guarantees, including a completion guarantee. We have agreements with our joint venture partners that indemnify us for their share of guarantees we provided. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to record a liability equal to the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantees and record an asset equal to the fair value of the indemnification we have received. As of September 30, 2024, we have a 7,914,000 asset and an 8,061,000 liability, which are included as a component of other assets and other liabilities , respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Transfer Tax Assessments 
 
 During 2017, the New York City Department of Finance NYCDOF issued Notices of Determination Notices assessing additional transfer taxes (including interest and penalties) in connection with the transfer of interests in certain properties during our 2014 initial public offering. We disagreed with the assessment and strongly contested the Notices. While we estimated that the range of loss from these Notices could be between 0 and 62,500,000, we concluded, after consultation with legal counsel, that it was not possible to predict any estimate within that range and as such we did not accrue any liability in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that may arise relating to such Notices. In February 2024, the NYCDOF completed its assessment and concluded that no additional taxes were due. 

Cash Flows 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 492,235,000 and 509,599,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 470,523,000 and 449,817,000 as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 17,364,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 20,706,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use and present NOI, Same Store NOI, FFO and Core FFO, as supplemental measures of our performance. The summary below describes our use of these measures, provides information regarding why we believe these measures are meaningful supplemental measures of our performance and reconciles these measures from net income or loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating these measures, and accordingly, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to other real estate companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In the first quarter of 2024, we updated our presentation of NOI, Cash NOI and Core FFO attributable to common stockholders to exclude the impact of Market Center and 111 Sutter Street, which we have designated as non-core assets. Accordingly, we have recast the presentation for all prior periods presented to reflect this change. 

Net Operating Income NOI 
 
 We use NOI to measure the operating performance of our properties. NOI consists of rental revenue (which includes property rentals, tenant reimbursements and lease termination income) and certain other property-related revenue less operating expenses (which include property-related expenses such as cleaning, security, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property administration and real estate taxes). We also present Cash NOI, which deducts from NOI, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above and below-market leases, including our share of such adjustments of unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we present Paramount s share of NOI and Cash NOI, which represents our share of NOI and Cash NOI of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures, based on our percentage ownership in the underlying assets. We use NOI and Cash NOI internally as performance measures and believe they provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. The following tables present reconciliations of our net income or loss to Paramount's share of NOI and Cash NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 The tables below set forth the reconciliations of our share of NOI to our share of Same Store NOI and Same Store Cash NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These metrics are used to measure the operating performance of our properties that were owned by us in a similar manner during both the current and prior reporting periods, and represent our share of Same Store NOI and Same Store Cash NOI from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures based on our percentage ownership in the underlying assets. Same Store NOI also excludes lease termination income, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases and certain other items that vary from period to period. Same Store Cash NOI excludes the effect of non-cash items such as the straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above and below-market leases.

Funds from Operations FFO and Core Funds from Operations Core FFO 
 
 FFO is a supplemental measure of our performance. We present FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ). Nareit defines FFO as net income or loss, calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization from real estate assets, impairment losses on certain real estate assets and gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate assets or from change in control of certain real estate assets, including our share of such adjustments of unconsolidated joint ventures. FFO is commonly used in the real estate industry to assist investors and analysts in comparing results of real estate companies because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. In addition, we present Core FFO as an alternative measure of our operating performance, which adjusts FFO for certain other items that we believe enhance the comparability of our FFO across periods. Core FFO, when applicable, excludes the impact of certain items, including, transaction related costs, realized and unrealized gains or losses on real estate related fund investments, unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps, severance costs, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and other non-core adjustments, in order to reflect the Core FFO of our real estate portfolio and operations. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results. 
 
 FFO and Core FFO are presented as supplemental financial measures and do not fully represent our operating performance. Neither FFO nor Core FFO is intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. Please refer to our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, for purposes of evaluating our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income or loss to FFO and Core FFO for the periods set forth below.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at both fixed and variable rates. We manage our market risk on variable rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to fix the rate or interest rate cap agreements to limit exposure to increases in rates, on all or a portion of the debt for varying periods through maturity. This in turn, reduces the risks of variability of cash flows created by variable rate debt and mitigates the risk of increases in interest rates. Our objective when undertaking such arrangements is to reduce our floating rate exposure and we do not enter into hedging arrangements for speculative purposes. Subject to maintaining our status as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we may utilize swap arrangements in the future. 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated debt, the weighted average interest rates and the fair value as of September 30, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
