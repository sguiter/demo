FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Certain statements made in this report are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements are based upon beliefs of, and information currently
available to, us as of the date hereof, as well as estimates and assumptions made by us. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used herein, the words anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, expect, forecast, future, intend, 
 plan, predict, project, target, potential, will, 
 would, could, should, continue or the negative of these terms and similar expressions
identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current view with respect to future events and are subject to risks,
uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to our business, industry, and our operations and results
of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Forward-looking
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements about: 

our ability to maintain
 an effective system of internal controls and accurately report our financial results; 

that we will continually
 seek to identify and acquire cybersecurity talent to expand our service scope and geographical coverage to provide the best possible
 service for our clients; 

our belief that our cash
 balance as of the date of this filing, together with anticipated revenues, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirement
 for the near term; 

the doubt about our ability
 to continue as a going concern; 

our efforts to developing
 our business, reducing overhead cost, and capital raising; 

our plan to improve our
 liquidity by a planned reduction in overhead costs and actively pursuing additional debt and /or equity financing through discussions
 with investment bankers and private investors; 

our estimate for indirect
 tax liabilities; and 

our expectation that we
 will incur further losses through the end of 2024. 

These
statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks detailed from
time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, any of which may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity,
or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting
principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions
upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions
are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would
be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. The following discussion should
be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

CISO
GLOBAL, INC. and subsidiaries 

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Unless
otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms we, us, our, and our
company refer to CISO Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Unless otherwise specified, all
dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. 

The
ability for us to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish the plan and eventually attain
profitable operations. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification
of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

Reclassifications 

Reclassifications
of certain immaterial prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. 

Use
of Estimates 

GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. We periodically evaluate our estimates and adjust prospectively, if necessary. We believe our estimates and assumptions are
reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ. 

We
believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Material estimates include the allowance for credit losses,
the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill, deferred tax asset and valuation allowance, the estimated fair value of assets
acquired, liabilities assumed and stock issued in business combinations, and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, share price, and expected dividend rate. 

and , respectively. 

of our common stock. The record date for the reverse
stock split was the close of business on March 7, 2024, with share distribution occurring on March 8, 2024. As a result of the reverse
stock split, stockholders received share of CISO Global, Inc. common stock, par value , for each shares they held as of
the record date. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated for the effects of this reverse stock split. Common
stock underlying our outstanding warrants, convertible notes, and options have also been adjusted, and the conversion and exercise prices
have also been adjusted. 

. The following tables summarize the securities that were excluded from the diluted per share calculation
because the effect of including these potential shares was antidilutive due to our net loss position even though the exercise price could
be less than the average market price of the common shares:

deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2024 represents our remaining performance obligations that will be recognized as revenue

We
committed to a formal plan to sell our former Latin America subsidiaries to focus on our US-based operations and development and
marketing of our internally developed cybersecurity software. The operating results of our former Latin America subsidiaries are
reported within discontinued operations on our condensed consolidated statements of operation through July 1, 2024. As a result of
the sale, we recorded a loss on disposal of ,

Purchase Agreement, we concurrently entered into a License-Back and Buy-Back Agreement which provides us with a perpetual, transferable
and royalty-free license to use the intellectual property rights to sell such software to our customers. The license is exclusive for
our use for the initial six months of this agreement. In exchange for these rights, we have agreed to continue development of the intellectual
property at our own cost. 

We
also retain the right to buy back the intellectual property at a price of , if such right is exercised within six months from
the date of the agreement, if repurchased within six to twelve months, or at an agreed upon purchase price if repurchased
after twelve months. 

vCISO

Indirect
Taxes 

We
are subject to indirect taxation in some, but not all, of the various states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.
Laws and regulations attempting to subject commerce conducted over the Internet to various indirect taxes are becoming more prevalent,
both in the U.S. and internationally, and may impose additional burdens on us in the future. Increased regulation could negatively affect
our business directly, as well as the business of our customers. Taxing authorities may impose indirect taxes on the Internet-related
revenue we generated based on regulations currently being applied to similar, but not directly comparable industries. There are many
transactions and calculations where the ultimate indirect tax determination is uncertain. In addition, domestic and international indirect
taxation laws are complex and subject to change. We may be audited in the future, which could result in changes to our indirect tax estimates.
We continually evaluate those jurisdictions in which nexus exists, and believe we maintain adequate indirect tax accruals. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accrual for estimated indirect tax liabilities was and , respectively,
reflecting our best estimate of the potential liability based on an analysis of our business activities, revenues subject to indirect
taxes, and applicable regulations. Although we believe our indirect tax estimates and associated liabilities are reasonable, the final
determination of indirect tax audits, litigation, or settlements could be materially different than the amounts established for indirect
tax contingencies. 

Warranties 

Our
services are generally warranted to deliver and operate in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable
and materially conform with our documentation under normal use and circumstances. 

We
offer a limited warranty to certain customers, subject to certain conditions, to cover certain costs incurred by the customer in case
of a security breach. We have entered into an insurance policy to cover our potential liability arising from this limited warranty arrangement.
We have not incurred any material costs related to such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations
in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In
addition, we also indemnify certain of our directors and executive officers against certain liabilities that may arise while they are
serving in good faith in their company capacities. We maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage that would generally
enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

compensation expenses decreased by 425,481, or 11 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, due to outstanding option awards becoming fully vested, a decrease in the amount of new stock options awarded to
our revenue generating employees, the decline in our share price which produces a lower fair value of our option awards to recognize
as stock-based compensation and the timing of the recognition of the reversal of expense for option forfeited by former employees in
2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Professional
fees decreased by 1,671,405, or 62 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023,
due to a decrease in accounting, legal, and other professional fees incurred related to our periodic SEC filings and our efforts to raise
additional capital. 

Advertising
and marketing expenses decreased by 235,836, or 87 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, due to utilization of more internal marketing resources. 

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses decreased by 3,241,943, or 23 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our analysis of our carrying amount of intangible assets being impaired for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, reductions in headcount, and lower costs for insurance and lease expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Stock
based compensation expenses decreased by 2,816,839, or 44 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, due to outstanding option awards becoming fully vested, a decrease in the amount of new stock options awarded
to our employees, the decline in our share price which produces a lower fair value of our option awards to recognize as stock-based compensation
and the timing of the recognition of the reversal of expense for option forfeited by former employees in 2023. 

23 

Impairment
of goodwill decreased by 31,776,820, or 100 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023, due to our analysis of our carrying amount of goodwill being impaired in 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfying liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 18,723,961 and negative cash flows from operations of 3,582,726 and expect to incur further losses
through the end of 2024. In the report accompanying our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our independent registered
public accounting firm stated that our financial statements were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern and that
they have substantial doubt as to our ability to do so based on our recurring losses from operations and need to raise additional capital.
These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount
or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 291,190,324 of available funding under our Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 from which we may
issue our securities to fund current and future operations, assuming there is adequate demand for our securities. 

Working
Capital Deficit 

Our
working capital deficit as of September 30, 2024 in comparison to our working capital deficit as of December 31, 2023, is summarized
as follows: 

As of 

September 30,

 13,094,693 
 
 Working capital deficit 
 (20,030,654 
 (9,404,568 

The
increase in current assets is primarily due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents from borrowings and collection of accounts
receivable, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of receipt of customer payments. The increase in current liabilities
is primarily due to our 5,000,000 related party convertible note coming due in March 2025, additional borrowings under short-term credit
facilities and on our new line of credit, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash
Flows 

Our
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 3,582,726 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily due to cash used to fund
a net loss of 18,723,961, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate of 12,671,400 and additional cash inflow by changes in the
levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivables, net, and an increase in deferred
revenue. Net cash used in operating activities was 6,704,498 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily due to cash
used to fund a net loss of 69,677,615, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate of 56,748,217 and additional cash inflow by
changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities, primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in
deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities of 916,905 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the sale of our subsidiary
vCISO. Net cash used in investing activities of 135,848 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to purchases of property
and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,105,679, which was primarily due to cash received
from borrowings on our loans payable and lines of credit, net of debt issuance cost, of 6,694,412, offset by 4,743,680 in repayments
of our loans payable and lines of credit. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was
 5,777,702, which was primarily due to cash received from the sale of our common stock of 6,682,198, 4,448,641 in net proceeds from
our loans payable, and 6,050,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, offset by aggregate repayments on loans payable and convertible
notes payable of 11,756,420. 

Based
on our current business plan, we believe our cash balance as of the date of this filing, together with anticipated revenues and additional
debt or equity financing, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirement for the near term. Upon obtaining additional debt
of equity financing new investors may require that we take the Company private and no longer operate as a publicly traded company. However,
there can be no assurance that the current business plan will be achievable. Such conditions raise substantial doubts about our ability
to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Our
existence is dependent upon our ability to develop profitable operations. We are devoting substantially all of our efforts to developing
our business, reducing overhead costs, and raising capital, although there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. No
assurance can be given that our actions will result in profitable operations or the resolution of liquidity problems. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

In
order to improve our liquidity, in addition to reductions in overhead costs, we are actively pursuing additional debt and/or equity financing
through discussions with investment bankers and private investors. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts
to secure additional financing. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount or classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
critical accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. 

25 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Our material estimates and assumptions include the allowance for credit
losses, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill, deferred tax asset and valuation allowance, the estimated fair value of
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and stock issued in business combinations, and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, share price, and expected dividend rate. Certain of our estimates, including
the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill, could be affected by external conditions, including those unique to us and general
economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates and could cause actual
results to materially differ from those estimates. 

Fair
Value Measurement 

The
fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement
that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance
are described below: 

Level
1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level
2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; or 

Level
3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity). 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets are comprised of trademarks, customer bases, non-compete agreements, and intellectual property with original estimated useful
lives with a range of 2 to 10 years. Once placed into service, we amortize the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful
lives on a straight-line basis. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually at year end or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting
unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit s
carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and revenue multiple
approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Failure to achieve these
expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. 

26 

Impairment
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets 

We
will periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant
such a review and at least annually. The carrying value of a long-lived and intangible asset is considered impaired when the anticipated
undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using
the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived and intangible assets to be
disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. The fair value
of the award is measured on the grant date. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Our
agreements with clients are primarily service contracts that range in duration from a few months to one year. We recognize revenue when
control of these services is transferred to the client for an amount, referred to as the transaction price, which reflects the consideration
to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 

A
contract with a client exists only when: 

the parties to the contract
 have approved it and are committed to perform their respective obligations; 

we can identify each party s
 rights regarding the distinct services to be transferred performance obligations 

we can determine the transaction
 price for the services to be transferred; and 

the contract has commercial
 substance, and it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services
 that will be transferred to the client. 

For
the majority of our contracts, we receive non-refundable upfront payments. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for
the effects of a significant financing component since we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the time of transfer
of the promised goods or services to the client and the time the client pays for these goods or services to be generally one year or
less. Our credit terms to clients generally average 30 days, although in some cases payments are required in 15 days. 

We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with original expected duration of one year or less. 

Our
revenue is categorized and disaggregated as reflected in our statements of operations as follows: 

Security
Managed Services 

Security
managed services revenue primarily consists of compliance, security managed services, SOC managed services, and vCISO. We consider these
services to be a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized as services and materials are provided to the customer. 

Professional
Services 

Professional
services revenue primarily consists of technical assessments, incident response and forensics, training, and other cybersecurity services.
We consider these services to be a single performance obligation, and revenue is recognized in the period in which the performance obligations
are satisfied. 

27 

Cybersecurity
Software 

Cybersecurity
revenue primarily consists of our internally developed software products CHECKLIGHT Endpoint Security Monitoring, ARGO Security Management,
CISO Edge Cloud Security Platform, DISC Net Gen VPN and Skanda Breach Assessment Tool. Each software offering is a single performance
obligation, and we begin revenue recognition upon provisioning of our cybersecurity software to our customers and recognize ratably over
the duration of the service period. We currently do not bundle our cybersecurity software with other product offerings and as a result,
judgment is not required to determine standalone selling price. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Because
we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. This does not include an evaluation by our independent registered public accounting firm regarding
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
