 1) Revenue generated from products purchased from this vendor was less than 10 of consolidated revenue during the period presented. 
 One customer accounted for and of the Company's total revenue during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. One customer accounted for of the Company's total revenue during both the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, no single customer comprised more than 10 of the consolidated accounts receivable balance. 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate to cover the future expected credit losses resulting from uncertainty regarding collections from customers or OEM vendors to make payments for outstanding balances. In estimating the required allowance, the Company takes into consideration historical credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates or gross domestic product growth. Expected credit losses are estimated on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist using an age-based reserve model. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. 
 
 The Company has uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements with global financial institutions under which trade accounts receivable of certain customers and their affiliates may be acquired, without recourse, by the financial institutions. Available capacity under these programs is dependent on the level of the Company s trade accounts receivable with these customers and the financial institutions willingness to purchase such receivables. In addition, certain of these programs also require that the Company continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, accounts receivable sold to and held by the financial institutions under these programs were billion and million, respectively. Discount fees related to the sale of trade accounts receivable under these facilities are included in Interest expense and finance charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Discount fees for these programs totaled million and million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively.

 of the total revenue for the periods presented. 
 Provisions for sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue. A liability is recorded at the time of sale for estimated product returns based upon historical experience and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be recorded in inventory upon product return. These provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by the Company. Revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers, which are considered variable consideration, at the time of sale based on an evaluation of the contract terms and historical experience. 
 The Company recognizes revenue on a net basis on certain contracts, where the Company s performance obligation is to arrange for the products or services to be provided by another party or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the Company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership, by recognizing the margins earned in revenue with no associated cost of revenue. Such arrangements include supplier service contracts, post-contract software support services, cloud computing and software as a service arrangements, certain fulfillment contracts, extended warranty contracts and certain of the Company's systems design and integration solutions arrangements which operate under a customer-owned procurement model. 
 The Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the sale of products. Shipping revenue is included in revenue when control of the product is transferred to the customer, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue. 
 The Company disaggregates its operating segment revenue by geography, which the Company believes provides a meaningful depiction of the nature of its revenue. Disaggregated revenue disclosure is presented in Note 12 Segment Information.

 time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into earnings in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are recorded in earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company classifies cash flows related to the settlement of its cash flow hedges as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company terminated its remaining interest rate swaps in May 2023 and had no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as of August 31, 2024. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts, as well as foreign currency forward contracts combined with zero cost foreign exchange collar contracts, to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated foreign operations which are designated as net investment hedges. The Company entered into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of change in the U.S. dollar value of the Company's investment in a euro functional subsidiary due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Gains and losses on the net investment hedges, which have been recorded in AOCI and will remain in AOCI until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company's investment, are included within the "Foreign currency translation adjustments and other" caption on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is being recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument.

 Overview 
 We are a Fortune 100 corporation and a leading global distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology ("IT") ecosystem. We serve a critical role, bringing products from the world's leading and emerging technology vendors to market, and helping our customers create solutions best suited to maximize business outcomes for their end-user customers.

Table of contents 

 Digital transformation and the migration to cloud computing is reshaping our industry, enabling businesses and consumers to evaluate, procure, acquire, and consume technology products and services in a variety of ways. Hybrid models of IT consumption, supporting both physical and virtual delivery methods are emerging, as hardware and software-based solutions become increasingly combined. As a result, customers are seeking greater integration of products, services and solutions that tie technologies together. Therefore, we believe it is important to provide a broad, end-to-end portfolio, with deep capabilities across the computing continuum to help customers manage the increasingly complex IT ecosystem and deliver the solutions and business outcomes the market desires. Our vision for the future is to be the vital solutions aggregator and orchestrator that connects the IT ecosystem. 
 Our global strategy is to deliver higher value by focusing on the following strategic priorities: 
 Invest in strategic technologies such as hybrid cloud, security, data analytics, artificial intelligence ("AI"), hyperscale infrastructure and services. 
 Strengthen our end-to-end portfolio of products, services and solutions, including technology-as-a-service and recurring revenue models. 
 Transform our company digitally through greater automation and advanced analytics, which we believe will enhance the customer experience, broaden our customer base, increase sales and augment our presence in strategic technologies. 
 Expand our global footprint and enhance the operational excellence of our businesses around the world. 
 We offer a comprehensive catalog of technology products from original equipment manufacturers OEM ), such as personal computing devices, mobile phones and accessories, and strategic technologies such as cloud, security, data/analytics, AI and hyperscale infrastructure. This enables us to offer comprehensive solutions to our reseller and retail customers. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, retailers and managed service providers. We combine our core strengths in distribution with demand generation, supply chain management and design and integration solutions to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain and aftermarket product support. We also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and healthcare and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of global computing components, logistics services and supply chain management. Additionally, we provide systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and networking solutions built specific to our customers workloads and data center environments. 
 We group the majority of our offerings into two primary solutions portfolios, Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions. Our Endpoint Solutions portfolio primarily includes personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and accessories, printers, peripherals, and supplies. Our Advanced Solutions portfolio primarily includes data center technologies such as hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers, software, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure and hyperscale infrastructure, via our Hyve business. 
 Our business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and low operating income as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin. The market for IT products has generally been characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles, although unit prices for certain products have increased during certain periods due to factors such as supply chain constraints and inflation. We set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide. 
 We are highly dependent on the end-market demand for IT products, and on our partners strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT products and software by OEM suppliers, replacement cycles for existing IT products, trends toward cloud computing and AI, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment, including the continued persistence of inflation and elevated interest rates, may also lead to consolidation or decline in the IT industries and increased price-based competition. Our systems design and integration solutions business is highly dependent on the demand for cloud infrastructure, and the number of key customers and suppliers in the market. Our business includes operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific and Japan ("APJ") so we are affected by demand for our products in those regions, as well as the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the United States ("U.S.") dollar.

 Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information, including: 
 Revenue in constant currency, which is revenue adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Revenue in constant currency is calculated by translating the revenue for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 in the billing currency using the comparable prior period currency conversion rate. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. 
 Non-GAAP gross profit, which is gross profit, adjusted to exclude the portion of purchase accounting adjustments that affected cost of revenue. 
 Non-GAAP gross margin, which is non-GAAP gross profit, as defined above, divided by revenue. 
 Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income, adjusted to exclude acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense and purchase accounting adjustments. 
 29 

Table of contents 

 Non-GAAP operating margin, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, divided by revenue. 
 Non-GAAP net income, which is net income, adjusted to exclude acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments and income taxes related to the aforementioned items. 
 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share EPS ), which is diluted EPS excluding the per share impact of acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments and income taxes related to the aforementioned items. 
 Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, which are expensed as incurred, primarily represent professional services costs for legal, banking, consulting and advisory services, severance and other personnel related costs, share-based compensation expense and debt extinguishment fees that are incurred in connection with acquisition, integration, restructuring and divestiture activities. From time to time, this category may also include transaction-related gains/losses on divestitures/spin-off of businesses, costs related to long-lived assets including impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization expense due to changes in asset useful lives, as well as various other costs associated with the acquisition or divestiture. Effective as of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company ceased recording expenses associated with activities related to the Merger within acquisition, integration and restructuring costs. 
 Our acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of finite-lived intangible assets which consist primarily of customer relationships and vendor lists. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Although intangible assets contribute to our revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the sale of our products. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of our acquisition activity. Accordingly, we believe excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments which neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance, enhances our and our investors ability to compare our past financial performance with our current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within our GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. 
 Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of equity awards to employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors based on the estimated fair value of those awards. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees, the fair value of the share-based awards may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards and the expense can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Given the variety and timing of awards and the subjective assumptions that are necessary when calculating share-based compensation expense, we believe this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results from period to period. 
 Purchase accounting adjustments are primarily related to the impact of recognizing the acquired vendor and customer liabilities from the Merger at fair value. These adjustments benefited our non-GAAP operating income through the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 based on historical settlement patterns with our vendors and in accordance with the timing defined in our policy for releasing vendor and customer liabilities we deem remote to be paid. 
 We believe that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand our base operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with data presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Consolidated Commentary 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated revenue and revenue in constant currency increased by 724.1 million and 782.8 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increases are primarily driven by growth in both our Advanced Solutions and Endpoint Solutions portfolios, partially offset by a greater percentage of our revenue being presented on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue compared to the prior three months ended August 31, 2023 by approximately 550 million, or 4 . 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, consolidated revenue and revenue in constant currency decreased by 540.2 million and 546.2 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The decreases are primarily driven by the presentation of additional revenue on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue compared to the prior nine months ended August 31, 2023 by approximately 1.6 billion, or 4 , partially offset by growth in our Advanced Solutions portfolio. 
 Americas Commentary 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, Americas revenue and revenue in constant currency increased by 210.4 million and 238.2 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increases are primarily driven by growth in our Advanced Solutions portfolio in the region, partially offset by a greater percentage of our revenue being presented on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 by approximately 470 million, or 5 .

Table of contents 

 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, Americas revenue and revenue in constant currency decreased by 667.0 million and 650.0 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The decreases are primarily driven by the presentation of additional revenue on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023 by approximately 1.3 billion, or 5 , partially offset by growth in our Advanced Solutions portfolio. 
 Europe Commentary 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, Europe revenue and revenue in constant currency increased by 363.6 million and 376.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increases are primarily driven by growth in both our Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions portfolios in the region, partially offset by a greater percentage of our revenue being presented on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 by approximately 40 million, or 1 . 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, Europe revenue and revenue in constant currency decreased by 74.3 million and 179.8 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The decreases are primarily driven by the presentation of additional revenue on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue by approximately 240 million, or 2 , compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023, partially offset by growth in our Endpoint Solutions portfolio. The impact of changes in foreign currencies is primarily due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
 APJ Commentary 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, APJ revenue and revenue in constant currency increased by 150.1 million and 168.3 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increases are primarily driven by growth in both our Advanced Solutions and Endpoint Solutions portfolios in the region, partially offset by a greater percentage of our revenue being presented on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue by approximately 50 million, or 6 . The impact of changes in foreign currencies is primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, APJ revenue and revenue in constant currency increased by 201.0 million and 283.6 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increases are primarily driven by growth in our Advanced Solutions portfolio in the region, partially offset by a decline in our Endpoint Solutions portfolio and by a greater percentage of our revenue being presented on a net basis, which negatively impacted our revenue by approximately 60 million, or 2 . The impact of changes in foreign currencies is primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.

Table of contents 

 Our gross profit, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in revenue due to growth in both our Advanced Solutions and Endpoint Solutions portfolios. 
 Our gross margin, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher strategic technologies margins in the prior year period and a less profitable mix of products sold in the current period. The presentation of additional revenues on a net basis positively impacted our gross margin by approximately 23 basis points. 
 Our gross profit increased slightly during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in purchase accounting adjustments related to the Merger. Our non-GAAP gross profit decreased during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the decrease in revenues. 
 Our gross margin, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, increased during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the presentation of additional revenues on a net basis, which positively impacted our gross margin by approximately 24 basis points.

 Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs such as salaries, commissions, bonuses and temporary personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include cost of warehouses, delivery centers and other non-integration facilities, share-based compensation expense, utility expenses, legal and professional fees, depreciation on certain of our capital equipment, bad debt expense, amortization of our intangible assets, and marketing expenses, offset in part by reimbursements from our OEM suppliers. 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses slightly decreased, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower credit costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower credit costs. 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased revenue and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue along with higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower credit costs. A greater percentage of our revenue was presented on a net basis which increased the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 by approximately 16 and 17 basis points, respectively. 
 
 Acquisition, Integration and Restructuring Costs 
 Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs are primarily comprised of costs related to the Merger and costs related to the Global Business Optimization 2 Program initiated by Tech Data prior to the Merger (the GBO 2 Program of 3.9 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, and 3.0 million and 9.0 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. Acquisition, integration and restructuring costs related to other acquisitions were 0.7 million and 1.9 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. We do not expect to incur additional costs under the GBO 2 Program in future periods.

 The Merger 
 We have substantially completed the acquisition, integration and restructuring activities related to the Merger. Therefore, there were no material related expenses recorded within acquisition, integration and restructuring costs for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and there are no material expenses expected in future periods. We previously incurred acquisition, integration and restructuring costs related to the completion of the Merger, including professional services costs, personnel and other costs, long-lived assets charges and termination fees, and stock-based compensation expense. Professional services costs are primarily comprised of IT and other consulting services, as well as legal expenses. Personnel and other costs are primarily comprised of costs related to retention and other bonuses, severance and duplicative labor costs. Long-lived assets charges and termination fees include accelerated depreciation and amortization expense of 5.5 million recorded during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 4.7 million and 16.2 million recorded during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively, due to changes in asset useful lives in conjunction with the consolidation of certain IT systems, along with 17.0 million recorded during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 0.4 million and 12.9 million recorded during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively, for termination fees related to certain IT systems. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to costs associated with the conversion of certain Tech Data performance-based equity awards issued prior to the Merger into restricted shares of TD SYNNEX (refer to Note 4 Share-Based Compensation to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information) and expenses for certain restricted stock awards issued in conjunction with the Merger. 
 In July 2023, we offered a voluntary severance program ("VSP") to certain co-workers in the U.S. as part of our cost optimization efforts related to the Merger. We incurred 10.1 million of costs in connection with the VSP during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, including 8.0 million of severance costs and 2.1 million of duplicative labor costs. We incurred 37.2 million of costs in connection with the VSP during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, including 30.0 million of severance costs and 7.2 million of duplicative labor costs. 
 During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, acquisition and integration expenses related to the Merger were composed of the following:

Cash Flows 
 Our business is working capital intensive. Our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory. We rely heavily on term loans, sales of accounts receivable, our securitization program, our revolver programs and net trade credit from vendors for our working capital needs. We have financed our growth and cash needs to date primarily through cash generated from operations and financing activities. As a general rule, when sales volumes are increasing, our net investment in working capital dollars typically increases, which generally results in decreased cash flow generated from operating activities. Conversely, when sales volumes decrease, our net investment in working capital dollars typically decreases, which generally results in increases in cash flows generated from operating activities. 
 We calculate CCC as days of the last fiscal quarter s revenue outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply on hand in inventory, less days of the last fiscal quarter s cost of revenue outstanding in accounts payable. Our CCC was 21 days as of August 31, 2024, and 23 days as of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, respectively. Our CCC decreased as compared to November 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in DSO as our accounts receivable declined due to timing of cash receipts, with offsetting increases in DIO and DPO, due to an increase in our inventory balances to support growth in our business and a corresponding increase in our accounts payable. Our CCC decreased compared to August 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in DPO due to timing of payments and a decrease in DIO due to growth in our business while inventory balances increased slightly, partially offset by an increase in DSO due to the timing of cash receipts. 
 To increase our market share and better serve our customers, we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions. We expect that any such expansions would require an initial investment in working capital, personnel, facilities and operations. These investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by our existing cash and cash equivalents, additional borrowings, or the issuance of securities.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 655.8 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1.2 billion during the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in inventory during the nine months ended August 31, 2023 related to ongoing sell-through of strategic inventory purchases that occurred during fiscal year 2022, along with a larger decrease in accounts receivable during the nine months ended August 31, 2023 correlated with the decrease in sales volumes. These changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 related to the timing of cash payments, as compared to a decrease in accounts payable during the nine months ended August 31, 2023 correlated with the decrease in inventory in the prior year. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 was 181.6 million and 113.2 million, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of businesses in the current year of 32.4 million, along with settlement of net investment hedges of 14.8 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 655.4 million as compared to net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended August 31, 2023 of 405.6 million. The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program, which totaled 509.9 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 277.8 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2023. 
 We believe our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and credit availability are sufficient to support our operating activities for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 853.9 million and 1.0 billion as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held by international subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the U.S. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. If in the future we repatriate foreign cash back to the U.S., we will report in our Consolidated Financial Statements the impact of state and withholding taxes depending upon the planned timing and manner of such repatriation. Presently, we believe we have sufficient resources, cash flow and liquidity within the U.S. to fund current and expected future working capital, investment and other general corporate funding requirements. 
 We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flows from operations and our existing sources of liquidity, including available capacity under our borrowing facilities, will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months in all geographies. We also believe that our longer-term working capital, planned capital expenditures, anticipated stock repurchases, dividend payments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
 Credit Facilities and Borrowings 
 In the U.S., we have an accounts receivable securitization program to provide additional capital for our operations (the "U.S. AR Arrangement"). Under the terms of the U.S. AR Arrangement, we and our subsidiaries that are party to the U.S. AR Arrangement can borrow up to a maximum of 1.5 billion based upon eligible trade accounts receivable. The U.S. AR Arrangement, as amended December 11, 2023, March 29, 2024 and August 1, 2024, has a maturity date of December 2025. We also have an amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of April 16, 2024 (as amended, the "TD SYNNEX Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which we received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of 3.5 billion, which revolving credit facility (the "TD SYNNEX Revolving Credit Facility") may, at our request but subject to the lenders' discretion, potentially be increased by up to an aggregate amount of 500.0 million. There was 31.0 million outstanding under the U.S. AR Arrangement at August 31, 2024 at an interest rate of 6.21 . There were no amounts outstanding under the U.S. AR Arrangement at November 30, 2023. There were no amounts outstanding on the TD SYNNEX Revolving Credit Facility at August 31, 2024 or November 30, 2023.

Table of contents 

 The TD SYNNEX Credit Agreement also includes a 1.5 billion term loan facility (the "TD SYNNEX Term Loan") that was fully funded in connection with the Merger. The TD SYNNEX Term Loan has a maturity date of September 2026. As amended, the TD SYNNEX Revolving Credit Facility will mature on April 16, 2029, subject, in the lender's discretion, to two one-year extensions upon our prior notice to the lenders. 
 On April 19, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the "2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement") which provides for a senior unsecured term loan in the amount of 750.0 million (the "2024 Term Loan"). The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used to repay a portion of the TD SYNNEX Term Loan. The 2024 Term Loan will mature on September 1, 2027. 
 We have various other committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions, short-term loans, term loans, credit facilities and book overdraft facilities, totaling approximately 580.9 million in borrowing capacity as of August 31, 2024. Our borrowings on these facilities vary within the period primarily based on changes in our working capital. There was 283.2 million outstanding on these facilities at August 31, 2024, at a weighted average interest rate of 6.83 , and there was 208.7 million outstanding on these facilities at November 30, 2023, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.52 . 
 Historically, we have renewed our accounts receivable securitization program and our parent company credit facilities on, or prior to, their respective expiration dates. We have no reason to believe that these and other arrangements will not be renewed or replaced as we continue to be in good credit standing with the participating financial institutions. We have had similar borrowing arrangements with various financial institutions throughout our years as a public company. 
 We had total outstanding borrowings of approximately 4.1 billion as of both August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023. Our outstanding borrowings include Senior Notes of 2.4 billion and 2.5 billion as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively, and term loans described above as the TD SYNNEX Term Loan and 2024 Term Loan of approximately 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. For additional information on our borrowings, see Note 10 Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. We repaid the 700.0 million of 1.250 Senior Notes that were due August 9, 2024 primarily using funds received from the issuance of our 600.0 million of 6.10 Senior Notes due April 12, 2034. 
 Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements 
 We have uncommitted accounts receivable purchase agreements under which trade accounts receivable owed by certain customers may be acquired, without recourse, by certain financial institutions. Available capacity under these programs is dependent upon the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions willingness to purchase such receivables. In addition, certain of these programs also require that we continue to service, administer and collect the sold accounts receivable. At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had a total of 1.0 billion and 864.6 million, respectively, of trade accounts receivable sold to and held by financial institutions under these programs. Discount fees for these programs totaled 16.4 million and 49.0 million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, and 12.5 million and 36.2 million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year 1.0 billion share repurchase program. In March 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new 2.0 billion share repurchase program, supplementing the amount remaining under the existing program, pursuant to which we may repurchase our outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The March 2024 share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. We repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for 56.5 million and 4.7 million shares for 509.9 million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively and 1.1 million shares for 103.0 million and 2.9 million shares for 277.8 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. As of August 31, 2024, we had 1.9 billion available for future repurchases of our common stock. For additional information on our share repurchase program, see Note 5 Stockholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

 Covenant Compliance 
 Our credit facilities have a number of covenants and restrictions that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. They also limit our (or our subsidiaries', as applicable) ability to incur additional debt or liens, enter into agreements with affiliates, modify the nature of our business, and merge or consolid ate. As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant requirements for the above arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with management s evaluation during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) to the extent that the Outstanding Principal Amount of all Advances is at any time equal to or less than the Non-Accordion Facility Limit, all Advances shall be made during such time ratably according to each Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Non-Accordion Facility Limit prior to giving effect to any increases under this clause (c) and (B) so long as the Outstanding Principal Amount of all Advances is greater than the Non-Accordion Facility Limit, all Advances with respect to the Accordion Facility Limit shall be made ratably according to each Lender s Accordion Pro Rata Share of the Accordion Facility Limit. 
 (v) On any date of determination, if the aggregate Accordion Advanced Amount is greater than zero after giving effect to any reduction pursuant to clause (a) , the Borrower shall immediately pay to each Managing Agent of an Increasing Lender Group, for the benefit of the related Lenders, an amount to be applied to reduce such Lender s Accordion Advanced Amount (ratably, according to each such Lender s Accordion Advanced Amount), such that after giving effect to such payment, the aggregate Accordion Advanced Amount does not exceed the Accordion Facility Limit then in effect. 
 (vi) The Borrower s request for the increases with respect to Commitments of any single Lender Group in respect of any Facility Limit Increase Request for 25,000,000 shall be a non-pro rata increase to the Commitment of such Lender Group if such Lender Group consents to such request.

 (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and or from any Payment Recipient who has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ), upon the Administrative Agent s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the Erroneous Payment Impacted Advance in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Advances (but not the Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Advance, the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment Agreement with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a 
 62 

Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and or against any recipient that receives funds on its behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold an Advance (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or Secured Party under the Related Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights ). 
 (e) Unless otherwise subsequently agreed in writing by the parties hereto, the parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Borrower Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Credit Parties, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Credit Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the proceeds of any financing or contribution incurred or obtained by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries). To the extent that Erroneous Payments are made with funds of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain all rights and remedies against the maker and recipients of such Erroneous Payment for return of such funds. 
 (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, waiver of any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 (g) Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 11.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Borrower Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Related Document.

 Section 12.02. Binding Effect Assignability . 
 (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Lender, each Managing Agent, each Administrator and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Borrower may not assign, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise convey any of its rights or obligations hereunder or interests herein without the express prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders. Any such purported assignment, transfer, hypothecation or other conveyance by the Borrower without the prior express written consent of the Requisite Lenders shall be void. 
 (b) The Borrower hereby consents to any Lender s assignment or pledge of, and or sale of participations in, at any time or times after the Effective Date of the Related Documents, Advances, and any Commitment or of any portion thereof or interest therein, including any Lender s rights, title, interests, remedies, powers or duties thereunder, whether evidenced by a writing or not, made in accordance with this Section 12.02(b) . Any assignment by a Lender shall (i) require the execution of an assignment agreement (an Assignment Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 12.02(b) or otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Termination Event has 
 64 

occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and without limiting the foregoing right to not unreasonably withhold consent, may be withheld if the short-term unsecured debt rating of the proposed Lender is not at least A-1 or the equivalent by S&P and P-1 or the equivalent by Moody s at the time of such assignment) (ii) if a partial assignment, be in an amount at least equal to 5,000,000 and, after giving effect to any such partial assignment, the assigning Committed Lender shall have retained Commitments in an amount at least equal to 5,000,000 (iii) not be to a Defaulting Lender in a different Lender Group and (iv) require the delivery to the Administrative Agent by the assignee or participant, as the case may be, of any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States tax withholding matters. In the case of an assignment by a Lender under this Section 12.02 , the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment, the same rights, benefits and obligations as it would if it were a Lender hereunder. The assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its Commitments or assigned portion thereof from and after the date of such assignment. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any assignment made in accordance with this Section 12.02(b) will give rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to the assignee and that the assignee shall thereupon be a Lender for all purposes. In all instances, each Committed Lender s obligation to make Advances shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to such Committed Lender s Pro Rata Share of the applicable Commitment. In the event any Lender assigns or otherwise transfers all or any part of a Revolving Note, such Lender shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, upon the request of such Lender, execute new Revolving Notes in exchange for the Revolving Notes being assigned and the Administrative Agent shall record the assignment or other transfer in the Register. No assignment or transfer of a Revolving Note shall be effective unless such assignment or transfer is recorded in the Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.02(b) , any Lender may, without consent from or notice to the Borrower or any other party hereto, at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of such Lender s rights under this Agreement and the other Related Documents to any Federal Reserve Bank or any other central banking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender or to any holder or trustee of such Lender s securities provided that no such pledge or assignment to any Federal Reserve Bank or any other central banking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, holder or trustee shall release such Lender from such Lender s obligations hereunder or under any other Related Document and no such holder or trustee shall be entitled to enforce any rights of such Lender hereunder unless such holder or trustee becomes a Lender hereunder through execution of an Assignment Agreement as set forth above. 
 (c) In addition to the foregoing right, without notice to or consent from the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, (x) any Lender may assign to any of its Affiliates and any Discretionary Lender may assign to a Committed Lender or to a Program Support Provider all or a portion of its rights (but not its obligations) under the Related Documents, including a sale of any Advances or other Borrower Obligations hereunder and such Lender s right to receive payment with respect to any such Borrower Obligation provided that no Committed Lender may make any such assignment pursuant to this Section 12.02(c) to any of its Affiliates that is an asset-backed commercial paper conduit that is not a party to this Agreement in the capacity of a Lender and (y) any Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Related Documents (including all its rights and obligations with respect to the Advances) provided that (A) no such participant shall have a commitment, or be deemed to have made an offer to commit, to make Advances hereunder, and none shall be liable to any Person for any obligations of such Lender hereunder (it being understood that nothing in this Section 12.02(c) shall limit any rights the Lender may have as against such 
 65 

participant under the terms of the applicable option, sale or participation agreement between or among such parties) and (B) no holder of any such participation shall be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except actions directly affecting (i) any reduction in the principal amount of, or interest rate or Fees payable with respect to, any Advance in which such holder participates, (ii) any extension of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Advance in which such holder participates or the final maturity date thereof, and (iii) any release of all or substantially all of the Borrower Collateral (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Related Documents). Solely for purposes of Sections 2.08 , 2.09 , 2.10 , and 9.01 , Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each such sale or participation shall give rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to the participant and each such participant shall be considered to be a Lender for purposes of such sections. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, such Lender s rights and obligations, and the rights and obligations of the other Lenders, the Managing Agents and the Administrative Agent towards such Lender under any Related Document shall remain unchanged and none of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Managing Agent or any Lender (other than the Lender selling a participation) shall have any duty to any participant and may continue to deal solely with the assigning or selling Lender as if no such assignment or sale had occurred. 
 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, a Conduit Lender may, from time to time, with prior or concurrent notice to the Borrower, in one transaction or a series of transactions, assign all or a portion of its interest in the Advances and its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any other Related Documents to which it is a party to a Conduit Assignee provided that (i) if the ratings of the Commercial Paper of such Conduit Assignee are not at least equal to the ratings of such Conduit Lender, then Borrower consent shall be required, and (ii) such assignment complies with Section 12.02(b) (other than not requiring the consent of the Borrower). Upon and to the extent of such assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee, (i) such Conduit Assignee shall be the owner of the assigned portion of such interest, (ii) the related Administrator for such Conduit Assignee will act as the Administrator for such Conduit Assignee hereunder, with all corresponding rights and powers, express or implied, granted to the Administrator hereunder or under the other Related Documents, (iii) such Conduit Assignee (and any related commercial paper issuer, if such Conduit Assignee does not itself issue commercial paper) and their respective liquidity support provider(s) and credit support provider(s) and other related parties shall have the benefit of all the rights and protections provided to the Conduit Lender and its Program Support Provider(s) herein and in the other Related Documents (including any limitation on recourse against such Conduit Assignee or related parties, any agreement not to file or join in the filing of a petition to commence an insolvency proceeding against such Conduit Assignee, and the right to assign to another Conduit Assignee as provided in this paragraph), (iv) such Conduit Assignee shall assume all (or the assigned or assumed portion) of the Conduit Lender s obligations, if any, hereunder or any other Related Document, and the Conduit Lender shall be released from such obligations, in each case to the extent of such assignment, and the obligations of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee shall be several and not joint, (v) all distributions in respect of such interest in the Advances shall be made to the applicable Managing Agent or the related Administrator, as applicable, on behalf of the Conduit Lender and such Conduit Assignee on a pro rata basis according to their respective interests, (vi) the definition of the term CP Rate with respect to the portion of the Advances funded with commercial paper issued by the Conduit Lender from time to time shall be determined in the manner set forth in the definition of CP Rate applicable to the Conduit Lender on the basis of the interest rate or discount applicable to commercial paper issued by such Conduit Assignee (or the related commercial paper issuer, if such Conduit 
 66 

Assignee does not itself issue commercial paper) rather than the Conduit Lender, (vii) the defined terms and other terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Related Documents shall be interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, (viii) the Conduit Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender already, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Servicer, all applicable tax documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Servicer and (ix) if requested by the related Managing Agent or the related Administrator with respect to the Conduit Assignee, the parties will execute and deliver such further agreements and documents and take such other actions as the related Managing Agent or such Administrator may reasonably request to evidence and give effect to the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, no assignment by a Conduit Lender to a Conduit Assignee of all or any portion of its interest in the Advances shall in any way diminish the related Committed Lenders obligations under Section 2.03 to fund any Advances not funded by the related Conduit Lender or such Conduit Assignee. 
 (e) In the event that a Conduit Lender makes an assignment to a Conduit Assignee in accordance with clause (d) above, the Related Committed Lenders (i) if requested by the related Administrator, shall terminate their participation in the applicable Program Support Agreement to the extent of such assignment, (ii) if requested by the related Administrator, shall execute (either directly or through a participation agreement, as determined by such Administrator) the program support agreement related to such Conduit Assignee, to the extent of such assignment, the terms of which shall be substantially similar to those of the participation or other agreement entered into by such Committed Lender with respect to the applicable Program Support Agreement (or which shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrator and the Related Committed Lenders), (iii) if requested by the related Conduit Lender, shall enter into such agreements as requested by such Conduit Lender pursuant to which they shall be obligated to provide funding to the Conduit Assignee on substantially the same terms and conditions as is provided for in this Agreement in respect of such Conduit Lender (or which agreements shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to such Conduit Lender and the Committed Lenders), and (iv) shall take such actions as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request in connection therewith. 
 (f) Except as expressly provided in this Section 12.02 , no Lender shall, as between the Borrower and that Lender, or between the Administrative Agent and that Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of, or granting of a participation in, all or any part of the Advances, the Revolving Notes or other Borrower Obligations owed to such Lender. 
 (g) The Borrower shall assist any Lender permitted to sell assignments or participations under this Section 12.02 as reasonably required to enable the assigning or selling Lender to effect any such assignment or participation, including the execution and delivery of any and all agreements, notes and other documents and instruments as shall be reasonably requested and the participation of management in meetings with potential assignees or participants. 
 67

 (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Conduit Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including rights to payment of principal and interest on such Conduit Lender s Advances) to any Conduit Trustee without notice to or consent of the Borrower (and without entering into an Assignment Agreement) provided , that no such pledge or assignment to any Conduit Trustee shall release such Conduit Lender from such Conduit Lender s obligations hereunder or under any other Related Document or substitute any such Conduit Trustee for such Conduit Lender as a party hereto.

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH RELATED DOCUMENT (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY RELATED DOCUMENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDES TO THE CONTRARY) AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE, BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES), EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PERFECTION, EFFECT OF PERFECTION OR PRIORITY OF THE INTERESTS OF BUYER IN THE RECEIVABLES OR REMEDIES HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER, IN RESPECT THEREOF, ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

The books of the Subordinated Lender and such schedule shall be presumptive evidence of the amounts due and owing to the Subordinated Lender by the Borrower provided that any failure of the Subordinated Lender to record a notation in its books or on the schedule to this Note as aforesaid or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay Subordinated Loans in accordance with their respective terms set forth herein. 
 All capitalized terms, unless otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Third Amended and Restated Receivables Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of January 23, 2009 (as the same may be subsequently amended, restated or otherwise modified, the Sale Agreement by and among the Borrower, the Subordinated Lender, the other Originators thereunder and TD SYNNEX Corporation.

 Interest shall be payable on the outstanding principal amount of this Note from time to time in arrears on the first Business Day of each calendar month. All computations of interest shall be made by the Subordinated Lender on the basis of a 365 day year, in each case for the actual number of days occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. The Interest Rate shall be determined (i) on the first Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Date for calculation of the Interest Rate for the period from the Effective Date through the end of the first calendar month following the Effective Date, and (ii) as of the last Business Day of each month for use in calculating the interest that is payable for the following calendar month, and the Interest Rate so determined shall be utilized for such calendar month. Each determination by the Subordinated Lender of an interest rate hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Borrower (absent manifest error). The Borrower shall pay interest at the applicable Interest Rate on unpaid interest on any Subordinated Loan or any installment thereof, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder (to the extent permitted by law) that shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) for the period commencing on the due date thereof to (but excluding) the date the same is indefeasibly paid in full. 
 If any payment or prepayment on this Note becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the Interest Rate during such extension. 
 As set forth below, the indebtedness evidenced by this Subordinated Note is subordinate in right of payment to all Borrower Obligations and all renewals, extensions, refinancings or refundings of any such obligations (whether for principal, interest (including but not limited to interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceeding (each, an Insolvency Proceeding whether or not such interest is allowed in such Insolvency Proceeding), fees, indemnities, repurchase price, expenses or otherwise) (collectively, the Senior Obligations ). The subordination provisions contained herein are for the direct benefit of, and may be enforced by, any holder of a Senior Obligation, and may not be terminated, amended or otherwise revoked until the Senior Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Related Documents terminated in accordance with their respective terms. This Subordinated Note shall not be subject to any defense or any rights of set-off, including on account of any past or present debt. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Termination Event or Incipient Termination Event, the Subordinated Lender shall not demand, accelerate, sue for, take, receive or accept from the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or any other manner (including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral) any payment of or security for all or any part of the indebtedness under this Subordinated Note or exercise any remedies or take any action or proceeding to enforce the same. The Subordinated Lender hereby agrees that prior to the date that is one year and one day after all of the Senior Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Related Documents terminated in accordance with their respective terms, the Subordinated Lender will not take any action to institute any Insolvency Proceeding in respect of 
 Receivables Sale and Servicing Agreement 
 Exhibit 2.01(c)(ii)-2 

the Borrower or which would be reasonably likely to cause the Borrower to be subject to, or seek the protection of, any such Insolvency Proceeding. 
 If the Borrower becomes subject to any Insolvency Proceeding, then the holders of the Senior Obligations shall receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or with respect to the Senior Obligations before the Subordinated Lender shall be entitled to receive any payment on account of this Subordinated Note. Accordingly, any payment or distribution of assets of the Borrower of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property, in any applicable Insolvency Proceeding, that would otherwise be payable to or deliverable upon or with respect to any or all indebtedness under this Subordinated Note, is hereby assigned to and shall be paid or delivered by the person making such payment or delivery (whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, custodian or liquidating trustee or otherwise) directly to the Administrative Agent for application to, or as collateral for the payment of, the Senior Obligations until such Senior Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. 
 In no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of advancement of the proceeds hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Subordinated Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of money advanced hereunder exceed the highest rate of interest permissible under law (the Maximum Lawful Rate ). In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Subordinated Lender has charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, the amount of interest payable hereunder shall be equal to the amount payable under the Maximum Lawful Rate provided that if at any time thereafter the amount of interest payable to Subordinated Lender hereunder is less than the amount payable under the Maximum Lawful Rate, the Borrower shall continue to pay interest hereunder at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received by Subordinated Lender from the making of Subordinated Loans hereunder is equal to the total interest that Subordinated Lender would have received had the amount of interest payable to Subordinated Lender hereunder been (but for the operation of this paragraph) the amount of interest payable from the Effective Date. Thereafter, the amount of interest payable hereunder shall be the amount determined in accordance with the terms hereof unless and until the amount so calculated again exceeds the amount payable under the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this paragraph shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest received by Subordinated Lender pursuant to the terms hereof exceed the amount that Lender could lawfully have received had the interest due hereunder been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. In the event the amount payable under the Maximum Lawful Rate is calculated pursuant to this paragraph, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction, notwithstanding the provisions of this Note, shall make a final determination that Subordinated Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, Subordinated Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, promptly apply such excess first to any interest due and not yet paid hereunder, then to the outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Loans, then to fees and any other unpaid charges, and thereafter shall refund any excess to the Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise order. 
 Wherever possible each provision of this Note shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the 
 Receivables Sale and Servicing Agreement 
 Exhibit 2.01(c)(ii)-3 

extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or remaining provisions of this Note. 
 Time is of the essence of this Note. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower expressly waives presentment, demand, diligence, protest and all notices of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Note. 
 BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, THE BORROWER HERETO WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES UNDER THIS NOTE, THE SALE AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. 
 THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES), AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 Section 4. Subrogation . Parent agrees not to exercise any rights that it may acquire by way of subrogation against any Synnex Entity and its property or any rights of indemnification, contribution and reimbursement from any Synnex Entity and its property, in each case in connection with this Agreement and any payments made hereunder, until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and performed in full and the Termination Date has occurred. 
 Section 5. Separate Identity from Buyer . Parent shall itself, and shall ensure that each of its Affiliates, at all times comply with the covenants and agreements of the Originators set forth in Section 4.02(i) of the Sale Agreement as if Parent and each of its Affiliates were identified therein.
