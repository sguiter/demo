 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, foresees, intends, plans, projects, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as could, may, might, should, will, and would, or variations or negatives of such terms are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, although not all forward-looking statements include the foregoing words. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 economic uncertainty or a deterioration in economic conditions or slowdowns in economic growth in the United States generally, and particularly in the market areas in which we operate and in which our loans are concentrated, including declines in home sale volumes and financial stress on borrowers (consumers and businesses) as a result of fluctuating interest rates or an uncertain economic environment; 
 adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity, and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments and increased regulatory scrutiny), our ability to effectively manage our liquidity risk and any growth plans and the availability of capital and funding; 
 our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including our ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets; 
 fluctuating and/or volatile interest rates, capital markets and the impact of inflation on our business and financial results, as well as the impact on our customers (including the velocity and levels of deposit withdrawals and loan repayments); 
 the impact of fluctuating interest rates on our financial projections, models and guidance; 
 changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; 
 prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions may vary substantially from period to period; 
 global business and economic conditions and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our local market areas; 
 an increase in unemployment levels, slowdowns in economic growth and threats of recession; 
 customer income, creditworthiness and confidence, spending and savings that may affect customer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity; 
 the credit risk associated with the substantial amount of commercial real estate, construction and land development, and commercial loans in our loan portfolio; 
 the credit risks of lending activities, including our ability to estimate credit losses and the allowance for credit losses, as well as the effects of changes in the level of, and trends in, loan delinquencies and write-offs. 
 factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers and the success of construction projects that we finance, including any loans acquired in merger/acquisition transactions; 
 4 

Table of Contents 

 changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of residential and commercial real estate, especially as they relate to the value of collateral supporting the Company s loans; 
 natural disasters and adverse weather events (including hurricanes), acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities, (including the impacts related to or resulting from Russia s military action in Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict in Israel and the surrounding region, including the imposition of additional sanctions and export controls, as well as the broader impacts to financial markets and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments), regional or national protests and civil unrest (including any resulting branch closures or property damage), widespread illness or public health outbreaks or other international or domestic calamities, and other matters beyond our control; 
 system failures, cybersecurity threats and/or security breaches and the cost of defending against them and any reputational or other financial risks following such a cybersecurity incident; 
 the failure to maintain an effective system of controls and procedures, including internal control over financial and non-financial reporting; 
 deterioration of our asset quality; 
 risks associated with widespread inflation or deflation; 
 the risks of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to continue to identify acquisition or merger targets and successfully acquire and integrate desirable financial institutions; 
 changes in the value of collateral securing our loans; 
 our ability to anticipate interest rate changes and manage interest rate risk; 
 the effectiveness of our risk management framework and quantitative models; 
 the impact of fraud or misconduct by internal or external parties (including Origin employees), which we may not be able to prevent, detect or mitigate; 
 our inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary and to service debt, pay dividends to our common stockholders, repurchase our shares of common stock and satisfy obligations as they become due; 
 changes in our operation or expansion strategy or our ability to prudently manage our growth and execute our strategy; 
 changes in management personnel; 
 our ability to maintain important deposit customer relationships, our reputation or otherwise avoid liquidity risks; 
 increasing costs as we grow and compete for deposits; 
 operational risks associated with our business; 
 increased competition in the financial services industry, particularly from regional and national institutions, as well as fintech companies, may accelerate due to the current economic environment; 
 our level of nonperforming assets and the costs associated with resolving any problem loans, including litigation and other costs; 
 potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation, regulatory proceedings or enforcement actions; 
 risks related to environmental, social and governance ESG strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, associate, customer and third-party affiliations; 
 changes in the utility of our non-GAAP measurements and their underlying assumptions or estimates; 

5 

Table of Contents 

 changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or policies relating to financial institutions, as well as tax, trade, monetary and fiscal matters; 
 periodic changes to the extensive body of accounting rules and best practices, may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability; 
 further government intervention in the U.S. financial system; 
 results of upcoming local and national elections; 
 compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters; 
 a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and the federal budget; 
 the risk that the regulatory environment may not be conducive to, or may prohibit the consummation of, future mergers and/or business combinations, may increase the length of time and amount of resources required to consummate such transactions, and the potential to reduce anticipated benefits from such mergers or combinations; and 
 our ability to manage the risks involved in the foregoing. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

interest general partner, who has the power and authority to make decisions that impact economic performance of the project and is required to oversee and manage the project. Due to the lack of any voting, economic, or managerial control, and due to the contractual reduction in the investment, the Company accounts for its investment by amortizing the investment, beginning at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy of the project, over the compliance period, as management believes any potential residual value in the real estate will have limited value. Amortization is included as a component of income tax expense and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was and million, respectively.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had individual securities that were in an unrealized loss position. Management evaluates available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than the cost, and (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. 
 Management does not currently intend to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, management believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions.

 Collateral-dependent loans consist primarily of residential real estate, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. These loans are individually evaluated when foreclosure is probable or when the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral. In the case of commercial and industrial loans secured by equipment, the fair value of the collateral is estimated by third-party valuation experts. Loan balances are charged down to the underlying collateral value when they are deemed uncollectible. Note that the Company did not elect to use the collateral maintenance agreement practical expedient available under the current expected credit loss CECL guidance.

 All interest formerly accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
 interest income was recorded on nonaccrual loans while they were considered nonaccrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Company elects the fair value option for recording residential mortgage loans held for sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company had nonaccrual mortgage loans held for sale that were recorded using the fair value option election at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 During December 2023 and January 2024, the Company solicited non-binding indications of interest with respect to the proposed sale of substantially all of the Company s MSR asset. The Company subsequently sold its MSR asset and recorded a gain on the sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were MSR assets recognized or recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and the carrying value of the MSR is at September 30, 2024.

to basis points at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The Company believes the fair value approximates an exit price. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 Fair values for loans held for sale are established using anticipated sale prices for loans allocated to a sale commitment, and those unallocated to a commitment are valued based on the interest rate and term for similar loans allocated. The Company believes the fair value approximates an exit price. 
 Fair Value of Assets Recorded on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Non-marketable equity securities held in other financial institutions 
 The majority of the Company s non-marketable equity securities held in other financial institutions are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and qualify for the practical expedient allowed for equity securities without a readily determinable fair values, such that the Company has elected to carry these securities at cost adjusted for any observable transactions during the period, less any impairment. Non-marketable equity securities held in other financial institutions totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. To date, impairment has been recorded on the Company's investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company observed a price change in multiple orderly transactions for identical equity securities in one of the Company s equity securities and adjusted the Company s basis upwards by million. 
 Individually Evaluated Loans with Credit Losses 
 Loans for which it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest due according to contractual terms are measured to determine if any credit loss exists. Allowable methods for determining the amount of credit loss include estimating the fair value using the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans and a discounted cash flow methodology for other evaluated loans that are not collateral dependent. If the loan is identified as collateral-dependent, the fair value method of measuring the amount of credit loss is utilized. Evaluating the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor to the value. If the loan is not collateral-dependent, the discounted cash flow method is utilized, which involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds, collateral values and discount rate. Loans that have experienced a credit loss with specific allocated losses are within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when the credit loss is determined using the fair value method. The fair value of collateral-dependent loans that have specific allocated reserves was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Non-Financial Assets

 During December 2023 and January 2024, the Company solicited non-binding indications of interest with respect to the proposed sale of substantially all of the Company s MSR asset. The Company subsequently sold its MSR asset and recorded a gain on the sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were MSR assets recognized or recorded during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the Company is no longer retaining servicing on sold loans. 
 During the second half of 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its GNMA MSR portfolio, which met all final sale conditions in early 2023. The Company sold million in GNMA MSR, with no significant gain or loss realized, and derecognized the related GNMA repurchase asset and offsetting liability during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. 
 Prior to the sale of the Company s MSR, the Company received annual servicing fee income approximating of the outstanding balance of the underlying loans. In connection with the Company's activities as a servicer of mortgage loans, the investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company s assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. 
 The Company is potentially subject to losses on loans previously sold due to loan foreclosures. The Company has obligations to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold violated representations or warranties made by the Company and/or the borrower at the time of the sale, which the Company refers to as mortgage loan putback expenses. Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation and/or loans obtained through fraud by borrowers or other third parties. Putback claims may be made until the loan is paid in full. When a putback claim is received, the Company evaluates the claim and takes appropriate actions based on the nature of the claim. The Company is required by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to provide a response to putback claims within 60 days of the date of receipt. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the reserve for mortgage loan putback expenses totaled and , respectively. There is inherent uncertainty in reasonably estimating the requirement for reserves against future mortgage loan putback expenses. Future putback expenses depend on many subjective factors, including the review procedures of the purchasers and the potential refinance activity on loans sold with servicing released and the subsequent consequences under the representations and warranties.

 (1) Includes million and million of unconditionally cancellable commitments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company held unfunded letters of credit from the FHLB totaling million, with expiration dates ranging from October 16, 2024, to September 22, 2027. At December 31, 2023, the Company held unfunded letters of credit from the FHLB totaling million, with expiration dates ranging from January 14, 2024, to September 22, 2027. 
 Management establishes an asset-specific allowance for certain lending-related commitments and computes a formula-based allowance for performing consumer and commercial lending-related commitments. These are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the commercial loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown. The reserve for lending-related commitments was million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 Loss Contingencies 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company discovered certain questioned activity involving a former banker. The activity involved the banker, who has since been terminated, facilitating advances in and among certain customer loans and accounts that, in one or more instances, may not have been appropriately documented. The Company has notified its insurance providers of anticipated claims resulting from this activity, but there is no consideration in the Company s financial results of any potential insurance recoveries. The Company s investigation into the questioned activity and impact on its financial statements remains ongoing. 
 As a result of these specific activities, the Company recorded a provision for loan credit losses of million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Also, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, several of the relationships impacted by the activity were placed on non-accrual and we recorded an additional million provision for loan credit losses in conjunction with these loan relationships. additional provision for loan credit losses, or release of provision, has been made related to this activity during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, we have total loan loss reserves related to the questioned/impacted activity of million at September 30, 2024. 
 Also, as a result of the questioned activity and during the second and third quarters ended June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, the Company recorded additional expenses totaling million, which consisted of a loss contingency and interest expense accrual of million and legal and professional fees of million, recorded in noninterest expense. 
 The Company continues to work with a third-party forensic accounting team to confirm the Bank s identification and reconciliation of the activity, and also assist in evaluating any additional impact from the questioned activity. There is at least a reasonable possibility that an additional loss may have been incurred in excess of the amount accrued above and that a change in the estimate will occur in the near term. As of the date of this report, management has assessed that an estimate for this additional loss cannot be made. At this time, we believe that any ultimate loss arising from the situation will not be material to our financial position.

To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A.

 General 
 We are a financial holding company headquartered in Ruston, Louisiana. Origin s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Origin Bank, was founded in 1912 in Choudrant, Louisiana. Deeply rooted in Origin s history is a culture committed to providing personalized relationship banking to businesses, municipalities, and personal clients to enrich the lives of the people in the communities it serves. Origin provides a broad range of financial services and currently operates more than 60 locations in Dallas/Fort Worth, East Texas, Houston, North Louisiana, Mississippi, South Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. As a financial holding company operating through one segment, we generate the majority of our revenue from interest earned on loans and investments, service charges and fees on deposit accounts. 
 We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize the income generated from interest-earning assets and minimize expense of our liabilities through our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, securities and interest-bearing cash, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Changes in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as in the volume and types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.

 Results of Operations 
 Our net income decreased 5.7 million, or 23.5 , to 18.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 24.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a diluted EPS basis, we reported 0.60 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.79 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income decreased 8.2 million, or 11.6 , to 62.2 million, from 70.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We reported 2.00 diluted EPS per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was impacted by certain questioned activity involving a former banker which was explained in detail in Part I, Item 1, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies under Loss Contingencies. These items negatively impacted our diluted EPS by 0.02 and 0.27 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 74.8 million, an increase of 674,000, or 0.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an 8.8 million increase in total interest income, partially offset by an 8.1 million increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income earned on LHFI increased by 11.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, with 6.3 million of the increase attributed to higher yields and 5.6 million due to higher average LHFI balances. Interest income earned on LHFI during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased in substantially all loan categories, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income earned on real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit contributed 6.9 million, 2.5 million and 2.5 million, respectively, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in interest rates drove 4.2 million and 1.6 million of the increase in interest income earned on real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, and increases in average loan balances drove 2.8 million and 2.0 million of the increase in interest income earned on real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit for the comparable periods, respectively. The increase in interest income earned on LHFI was partially offset by a 2.0 million decrease in interest income earned on investment securities, primarily due to our strategic decision to sell available for sale investment securities to pay down FHLB advances during the intervening period. 
 Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 11.5 million, with 9.3 million of the increase driven by higher interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease of 2.7 million due to lower average FHLB advances and other borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the federal funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the loan and deposit rates offered by financial institutions. The federal funds target rate range was reduced by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024, to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 , the first rate reduction since early 2020. Prior to this movement, the fed funds rate was at a 23-year high. 
 The NIM-FTE was 3.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a four-basis point increase from 3.14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase was a change in the mix of interest-earning assets with higher yielding average LHFI balances increasing to 84.1 of total interest-earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80.1 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting this increase was continued decrease in the net interest spread reflected by a 45-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.04 from 3.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, with only a 40-basis point increase in the yield earned on interest-earning assets to 6.09 from 5.69 for the same period.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. The change in interest attributable to rate changes has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier period to the change in average balances outstanding between periods. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated, including the difference in day count, have been allocated to rate.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses, which includes the provisions for loan credit losses, off-balance sheet commitments credit losses and security credit losses, is based on management s assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses ACL for loans, securities, and our reserve for off-balance-sheet lending commitments. Factors impacting the provision include inherent risk characteristics in our loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, both current and historic, local economic and credit conditions, the direction of the change in collateral values, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the funding probability on unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain our ACL, which reflects management s best estimate of the life of loan credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, and our reserve for off-balance-sheet lending commitments, which reflects management s best estimate of losses inherent in our legally binding lending-related commitments. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan credit losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.

Table of Contents 

 Total provision expense increased by 1.1 million, to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an 1.1 million increase in provision expense for loan credit losses. The net increase in the provision expense for loan credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to increases in provision for loans individually evaluated. 
 Net charge-offs increased to 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to charge-offs on three commercial and industrial relationships totaling 10.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in recoveries. The allowance for loan credit losses ALCL to nonperforming LHFI was 149.35 at September 30, 2024, compared to 301.12 at September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of 32.7 million in our nonperforming LHFI compared to September 30, 2023, with 32.8 million of the increase primarily driven by five loan relationships, related to or impacted by, the questioned loan activity described in Part I, Item 1, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies under Loss Contingencies . Net charge-offs to total average LHFI (annualized) increased to 0.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are insurance commission and fee income, service charges and fees, other fee income, and mortgage banking revenue. 
 The table below presents the various components of and changes in our noninterest income for the periods indicated. 
 (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Noninterest income: 2024 2023 Change Change Insurance commission and fee income 6,928 6,443 485 7.5 Service charges and fees 4,664 4,621 43 0.9 Other fee income 2,114 2,006 108 5.4 Mortgage banking revenue 1,153 892 261 29.3 Swap fee income 106 366 (260) (71.0) Gain (loss) on sales of securities, net 221 (7,173) 7,394 103.1 Change in fair value of equity investments 10,096 (10,096) (100.0) Other income 803 868 (65) (7.5) Total noninterest income 15,989 18,119 (2,130) (11.8) 
 Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 2.1 million, or 11.8 , to 16.0 million, compared to 18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 10.1 million in the change in fair value of equity investments partially offset by an increase of 7.4 million in gain (loss) on sales of securities, net. 
 Change in fair value of equity investments. The 10.1 million decrease in change in fair value of equity investments was primarily due to a 10.1 million positive valuation adjustment on a non-marketable equity security that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable amount realized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain (loss) on sales of securities, net. The 7.4 million increase in gain (loss) on sales of securities, net was due to the sale of available for sale investment securities with a book value of 181.9 million, which realized a loss on sale of 7.2 million during three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable loss realized during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The 3.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses was primarily driven by increases of 1.5 million, 783,000, 751,000 and 606,000 in salary expense, share-based compensation, medical insurance expense and incentive compensation bonus, respectively. The increase in salary expense was mainly attributed to raises given as a result of our annual salary reviews in March 2024, combined with an increase of 12 full-time equivalent employees to 1,049 at September 30, 2024, from 1,037 at September 30, 2023. The increase in share-based compensation was primarily due to quarterly evaluation adjustments on performance stock units to align with payout expectations based on company performance. Medical insurance expense increased as a result of higher insurance premiums combined with higher self-insurance claims during the current period. The increase in incentive compensation bonuses can be attributed primarily to elevated anticipated payouts, driven by a greater focus on meeting deposit objectives. This is evidenced by a larger sum of incentives linked to these deposit goals, alongside an increase in accruals associated with financial targets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, leading to an increase in bonus expense. 
 Data Processing. The 695,000 increase in data processing expense was primarily due to an increase of 437,000 in software expenses, primarily driven by new services and increased fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Professional Services. The 603,000 increase in professional services was primarily due to 848,000 legal and audit fees that were incurred during the current quarter related to the questioned activity mentioned previously. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 5.1 million, compared to 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.4 and 19.1 , respectively.

 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 222.0 million, a decrease of 4.6 million, or 2.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily due to an increase in our total interest expense of 41.4 million, while total interest income increased by 36.8 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 58.7 million, with 45.0 million of the increase driven by higher interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease of 15.4 million due to lower average FHLB advances and other borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a strategic decision to sell available for sale securities to pay down borrowings and fund loan growth during the intervening period. 
 Interest income earned on LHFI during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased in substantially all loan categories when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income earned on real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit contributed 31.3 million, 9.0 million and 6.9 million, respectively, of the 47.1 million total increase in interest income earned on LHFI when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in interest rates drove 17.2 million, 5.8 million and 3.1 million of the increase in interest income earned on real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and mortgage warehouse lines of credit, and increases in average loan balances drove 14.1 million, 3.9 million and 3.2 million of the increase in interest income earned on real estate loans, mortgage warehouse lines of credit and commercial and industrial loans for the comparable periods, respectively. 
 The increase in interest income earned on LHFI was partially offset by lower average balances in investment securities and interest-bearing deposits in banks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decline led to a decrease of 11.0 million in interest income and was a result of our strategic decision to sell available for sale securities to pay down borrowings, fund loan growth, and to hold excess cash for contingency liquidity purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The NIM-FTE was 3.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a six basis point decrease from 3.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no impact to the NIM-FTE as a result of purchase accounting accretion income due to the BTH merger for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to three basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of this margin compression was a 72-basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to 3.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.24 for nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to just a 54-basis point increase in the yield earned on interest-earning assets to 6.04 from 5.50 . 
 As discussed previously in the Part I, Item 1, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies under Loss Contingencies, the reversal of 1.2 million of accrued interest associated with the impact of the questioned activity drove a two-basis point decline in the NIM-FTE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Had we not experienced the reversal of the accrued interest, our NIM-FTE would have been 3.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a four basis point decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following tables present the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. The change in interest attributable to rate changes has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier period to the change in average balances outstanding between periods. For purposes of the below table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated, including the difference in day count, have been allocated to rate.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 We recorded a provision expense of 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 1.2 million decrease from 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 1.4 million decrease in provision for off-balance sheet items, primarily due to lower loan commitment balances at September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, as discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies under Loss Contingencies, we experienced a combined 7.3 million provision increase associated with the questioned activity recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net charge-offs were 15.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 8.9 million increase in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans. The increase was primarily due to charge-offs on three relationships totaling 10.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by recoveries on one relationship totaling 2.8 million.

 Noninterest Income 
 The table below presents the various components of and changes in our noninterest income for the periods indicated.

 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 5.6 million, or 11.1 , to 55.7 million, compared to 50.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of 6.8 million, 1.7 million and 1.4 million in (loss) gain on sales of securities, net, insurance commission and fee income and mortgage banking revenue, respectively. These increases were offset by decreases of 4.9 million and 874,000 in change in fair value of equity investments and swap fee income, respectively. 
 (Loss) gain on sales of securities, net. The 6.8 million increase in (loss) gain on sales of securities, net was mainly due to sale of available for sale investment securities with a book value of 181.9 million, which realized a loss on sale of 7.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable amount realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Insurance commission and fee income. The 1.7 million increase in insurance commission and fee income was mainly due to increases in both direct bill commission and contingency income. The increase in direct bill commission was mainly driven by higher commissions from property and casualty insurance. The increase in contingency income was mainly due to new commercial accounts combined with lower claims for catastrophic events experienced by our insurance agency counterparties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Mortgage banking revenue. The 1.4 million increase in mortgage banking revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 1.5 million increase in gain on sale of loans held for sale combined with the 410,000 gain on sale of MSR, partially offset by a 549,000 decrease in servicing revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of equity investments. The decrease in change in fair value of equity investments was primarily due to a 5.2 million positive valuation adjustment on a non-marketable equity security during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was more than offset by a 10.1 million positive valuation adjustment on a non-marketable equity security that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Swap fee income. The 874,000 decrease in swap fee income was primarily due to a lower amount of swaps executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was largely due to the expectation throughout nine months ended September 30, 2024, that the Federal Reserve would cut rates.

 Noninterest Expense 
 The following table presents the significant components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 
 (Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, Noninterest expense: 2024 2023 Change Change Salaries and employee benefits 112,418 102,888 9,530 9.3 Occupancy and equipment, net 19,952 19,871 81 0.4 Data processing 10,083 8,528 1,555 18.2 Office and operations 8,558 7,887 671 8.5 Intangible asset amortization 6,179 7,369 (1,190) (16.1) Regulatory assessments 5,367 4,596 771 16.8 Advertising and marketing 4,221 4,296 (75) (1.7) Professional services 4,546 4,491 55 1.2 Loan-related expenses 2,733 3,941 (1,208) (30.7) Electronic banking 3,785 3,609 176 4.9 Franchise tax expense 2,013 2,392 (379) (15.8) Other expense 5,761 4,442 1,319 29.7 Total noninterest expense 185,616 174,310 11,306 6.5 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 11.3 million, or 6.5 , to 185.6 million, compared to 174.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of 9.5 million, 1.6 million and 1.3 million in salaries and employee benefits, data processing and other expense, respectively. These increases were offset by decreases of 1.2 million in both loan-related expenses and intangible asset amortization, respectively 
 Salaries and employee benefits. The 9.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses was primarily driven by increases of 5.3 million, 2.0 million, and 1.3 million and 1.1 million in salary expense, share-based compensation, medical insurance expenses and incentive compensation bonus, respectively. The increase in salary expense was mainly attributed to raises given as a result of our annual salary reviews in March 2024 and March 2023, combined with an increase of 12 full-time equivalent employees to 1,049 at September 30, 2024, from 1,037 at September 30, 2023. The increase in share-based compensation was primarily due to quarterly evaluation adjustments on performance stock units to align with payout expectations based on company performance. Medical insurance expense increased as a result of higher insurance premiums combined with higher self-insurance claims during the current period. The increase in incentive compensation bonuses can be attributed primarily to elevated anticipated payouts, driven by a greater focus on meeting deposit objectives. This is evidenced by a larger sum of incentives linked to these deposit goals, alongside an increase in accruals associated with financial targets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Data Processing. The 1.6 million increase in data processing expense was primarily due to an increase of 969,000 in software expenses, primarily driven by new services and increased fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also, contributing a combined increase of 563,000 were increased expenses associated with core services, compliance systems and finance and accounting data processing costs. 
 Other expense. The increase in other expense resulted from recognizing a contingent liability associated with certain questioned activity involving a single banker in one of our East Texas markets totaling approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loan-related expenses. The 1.2 million decrease in loan-related expenses was primarily due to decreases of 397,000 and 395,000 in loan related legal fees and servicing costs, respectively. 
 Intangible asset amortization. The 1.2 million decrease in intangible asset amortization is primarily due to the accelerated amortization method used to measure the amortization expense of the assets.

 Income Tax Expense 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 17.0 million, compared to 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 21.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 
 General 
 Total assets increased by 243.4 million, or 2.5 , to 9.97 billion at September 30, 2024, from 9.72 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets is primarily due to increases of 295.8 million and 40.8 million in our LHFI and cash and cash equivalents, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 92.7 million in available for sale securities. LHFI were 7.96 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.9 , compared to 7.66 billion at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased to 321.2 million, an increase of 14.5 , at September 30, 2024, compared to 280.4 million at December 31, 2023. Available for sale securities declined to 1.16 billion, reflecting a 7.4 decrease, at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.25 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Total deposits increased by 235.4 million, or 2.9 , to 8.49 billion at September 30, 2024, from 8.25 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases of 201.6 million and 55.4 million in money market and time deposits, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 25.9 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The increase in total deposits was partially offset by decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank advances, repurchase agreements and other borrowings of 53.2 million, or 63.6 , to 30.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 83.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Our loan portfolio is our largest category of interest-earning assets, and interest income earned on our loan portfolio is our primary source of income. At September 30, 2024, 76.5 of the loan portfolio held for investment was comprised of commercial and industrial loans, including mortgage warehouse lines of credit, commercial real estate and construction/land/land development loans, which were primarily originated within our legacy market areas of Texas, North Louisiana, and Mississippi, compared to 77.1 at December 31, 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, total LHFI were 7.96 billion, an increase of 295.8 million, or 3.9 , compared to 7.66 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by loan growth of 165.2 million, 113.4 million and 82.0 million in mortgage warehouse lines of credit loans, residential real estate, and CRE, respectively. These increases were offset by a decrease of 78.7 million in construction/land/land development loans. Total LHFI at September 30, 2024, excluding mortgage warehouse lines of credit, were 7.46 billion, reflecting an increase of 130.6 million, or 1.8 , compared to December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 A significant portion, 31.7 , of our LHFI portfolio at September 30, 2024, consisted of CRE loans secured by real estate properties. Such loans can involve high principal loan amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on a borrower s ongoing business operations or on income generated from the properties that are leased to third parties.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming/nonaccrual loans and property acquired through foreclosures or repossession, as well as bank-owned property not in use and listed for sale. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions, and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status even if the contractual payments are not past due if information becomes available that causes substantial doubt about the borrower s ability to meet the contractual obligations of the loan. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, but payments received are usually applied to principal. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, regardless of size, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the ALCL. 
 Purchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans. The Company evaluates acquired loans for deterioration in credit quality based on any of, but not limited to, the following: (1) nonaccrual status; (2) borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty which results in modification to the loan terms; (3) risk ratings of special mention, substandard or doubtful; (4) watchlist credits; and (5) delinquency status, including loans that are current on merger/acquisition date, but had previously been 60 days delinquent twice. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other individually evaluated loans. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses. We held approximately 25.0 million of unpaid principal balance PCD loans at September 30, 2024, and 34.8 million of unpaid principal balance PCD loans at December 31, 2023. 
 We manage the quality of our lending portfolio in part through a disciplined underwriting policy and through continual monitoring of loan performance and borrowers financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to losses due to declines in economic conditions or deterioration in the financial condition of our borrowers.

 As discussed in our June 30, 2024, Origin Bancorp, Inc. Form 10-Q, and explained in detail in Part I, Item 1, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies under Loss Contingencies, our credit metrics were negatively impacted by certain questioned activity involving a single banker, who has since been terminated, in our East Texas market. Our investigation of this activity remains ongoing and is not final. We continue to work with an outside forensic accounting firm to confirm the Bank s identification and reconciliation of the activity, targeting a conclusion of this analysis by the end of this year. At this time, we believe that any ultimate loss arising from the situation will not be material to our financial position. 
 Nonperforming LHFI increased 34.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, and nonperforming LHFI to LHFI increased to 0.81 compared to 0.39 . The 34.2 million increase in non-performing loans was primarily driven by 32.8 million, or five loan relationships, related to, or impacted by, the questioned loan activity mentioned above. Please see Note 4 Loans to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on nonperforming loans. 
 
 Potential Problem Loans 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans using risk grades which fall into one of five categories: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. We review the ratings on loans and adjust them to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is felt to be inherent or expected in each loan. The methodology is structured, so that reserve allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). Loans rated special mention reflect borrowers who exhibit credit weaknesses or downward trends deserving close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank s credit position at some future date. While potentially weak, no loss of principal or interest is envisioned, and these borrowers currently do not pose sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Loans rated substandard are those borrowers with deteriorating trends and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt. A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any, and where normal repayment from the borrower might be in jeopardy. 
 Loans rated as doubtful have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable, and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loans classified as loss are charged-off, and we have no expectation of the recovery of any payments with respect to loans rated as loss. Information regarding the internal risk ratings of our loans at September 30, 2024, is included in Note 4 Loans to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 Allowance for Loan Credit Losses 
 The ALCL represents the estimated losses for loans accounted for on an amortized cost basis. Expected losses are calculated using relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. We evaluate LHFI on a pool basis with pools of loans characterized by loan type, collateral, industry, internal credit risk rating and FICO score. We apply a probability of default, loss given default loss methodology, to the loan pools at September 30, 2024. Historical loss rates for each pool are calculated based on charge-off and recovery data beginning with the second quarter of 2012. These loss rates are adjusted for the effects of certain economic variables forecast over a one-year period, particularly for differences between current period conditions and the conditions existing during the historical loss period. Subsequent to the forecast effects, historical loss rates are used to estimate losses over the estimated remaining lives of the loans. The estimated remaining lives consist of the contractual lives, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Loans that exhibit characteristics different from their pool characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Certain of these loans are considered to be collateral dependent, with the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. For these loans, the fair value of collateral practical expedient is elected whereby the allowance is calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell (if applicable). Those individual loans that are not collateral dependent are evaluated based on a discounted cash flow methodology.

Table of Contents 

 The amount of the ALCL is affected by loan charge-offs, which decrease the allowance, recoveries on loans previously charged off, which increase the allowance, as well as the provision for loan credit losses charged to income, which increases the allowance. In determining the provision for loan credit losses, management monitors fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge-offs and recoveries and periodically reviews the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. If actual losses exceed the amount of the ALCL, it would materially and adversely affect our earnings. 
 Acquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans . We account for our mergers/acquisitions under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, we record a discount or premium, and also an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements . The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. 
 Purchased loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are PCD loans. An ALCL is determined using the same methodology as other individually evaluated loans. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the ALCL are recorded through the provision for credit losses. 
 As a general rule, when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected, or at 90 days past due, we will reflect that loan as nonperforming. It will remain nonperforming until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we will collect principal and accrued interest in full. When the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been confirmed, a charge-off will be taken in the period it is determined. 
 We establish general allocations for each major loan category and credit quality. The general allocation is based, in part, on historical charge-off experience and loss given default methodology, derived from our internal risk rating process. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. We give consideration to trends, changes in loan mix, delinquencies, prior losses, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other related information. 
 In connection with the review of our loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include: 
 for commercial real estate loans, the debt service coverage ratio, operating results of the owner in the case of owner-occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type; 
 for construction, land and land development loans, the perceived feasibility of the project, including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio; 
 for residential mortgage loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; 
 for commercial and industrial loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the business in excess of operating expenses compared to loan repayment requirements), the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral; and 
 for mortgage warehouse loans, the borrower s adherence to agency or investor underwriting guidelines, while the risk associated with the underlying consumer mortgage loan repayments, similar to other consumer loans, depends on the borrower s financial stability and are more likely than commercial loans to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships.

 Securities 
 Our securities portfolio totaled 1.18 billion at September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 93.5 million, or 7.3 , from 1.27 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to sales, maturities and calls, as well as normal principal paydowns during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our available for sale portfolio totaled 1.16 billion at September 30, 2024, and represented 98.5 of our total security portfolio and is comprised of 49.6 mortgage-backed, 24.9 municipal, 14.7 collateralized mortgage obligations, 6.9 corporate and 3.9 treasury/agency securities. Our available for sale portfolio totaled 1.25 billion at December 31, 2023, and represented 98.6 of our total security portfolio and is comprised of 47.8 mortgage-backed, 22.5 municipal, 13.2 collateralized mortgage obligations, 10.1 corporate/asset-backed and 6.4 treasury/agency securities. 
 All of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored entities. We do not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, Alt-A, or second lien elements in our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio did not contain any securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.

 Deposits 
 Deposits are the primary funding source used to fund our loans, investments and operating needs. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain both consumer and commercial deposit customers. These products consist of noninterest and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings deposits, money market accounts and time deposits. Deposits are primarily gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. We also obtain deposits from local municipalities and state agencies. 
 Total deposits increased at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases of 201.6 million, 55.4 million and 20.5 million in money market, time and savings deposits, respectively, and partially offset by a decrease of 25.9 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Typically, higher interest rates and sustained inflation will cause customers to move liquid asset balances into higher interest-earning vehicles such as money market funds. 
 The following table presents our deposit mix at the dates indicated:

 We manage our interest expense on deposits through specific deposit product pricing that is based on competitive pricing, economic conditions and current and anticipated funding needs. We may use interest rates as a mechanism to attract or deter additional deposits based on our anticipated funding needs and liquidity position. We also consider potential interest rate risk caused by extended maturities of time deposits when setting the interest rates in periods of future economic uncertainty.

 (1) Average brokered deposits include average brokered time deposits and average brokered interest-bearing demand of 510.4 million and 61.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average brokered deposits included average brokered time deposits of 431.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our average deposit balance was 8.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 257.0 million, or 3.1 , from 8.24 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average annualized rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.94 , compared to 3.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in the average cost of our deposits was primarily the result of the rapidly rising interest rate environment experienced since March 2022, when the Federal Reserve Board started a series of eleven federal funds target range rate increases cumulating in a 525-basis point increase to a target range of 5.25 to 5.50 . More recently, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve Board cut the federal funds target range rate 50 basis points from a 23-year high of 5.25 to 5.50 to 4.75 to 5.00 . 
 Average noninterest-bearing deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 1.87 billion, compared to 2.21 billion at September 30, 2023, a decrease of 335.5 million, or 15.2 , and represented 22.0 and 26.8 of average total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits have been impacted by the higher interest rate environment, as customers have been moving out of noninterest-bearing deposit balances into higher interest-earning investments, however, this trend has been slowing as rates begin to stabilize.

 At December 31, 2023, the Company had 34.7 million in subordinated promissory notes that were assumed in the merger with BTH BTH Notes with origination dates ranging from June 2015 to June 2021. After the five-year anniversary of issuance, the Company had the right to redeem the BTH Notes in part or in full at the Company s discretion and, if applicable, subject to receipt of any required regulatory approvals. Primarily due to the declining Tier 2 capital contribution of the BTH Notes, the Company elected to redeem all but 1.1 million of the BTH Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were eligible to borrow an additional 2.11 billion and 2.01 billion, respectively, from the FHLB. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Management oversees our liquidity position to ensure adequate cash and liquid assets are available to support our operations and satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loan funding and deposit withdrawals. Management continually monitors, forecasts and tests our liquidity and non-core dependency ratios to ensure compliance with targets established by our Asset-Liability Management Committee and approved by our board of directors. 
 Management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet sources of, and demands for, funds on a daily and weekly basis. 
 The Company, which is a separate legal entity apart from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity, including payment of any dividends that may be declared for its common stockholders and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities incurred by the Company. The cash held at the holding Company is available for general corporate purposes described above, as well as providing capital support to the Bank. In addition, at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had a line of credit under the terms of which the loan amount shall not exceed an aggregate principal balance of 100 million, consisting of an initial 50 million extension of credit and any one or more potential incremental revolving loan amounts that the lender may make in its sole discretion, up to an aggregate principal of 50 million, upon the request of the Company. 
 The table below shows the liquidity measures for the Company at the dates indicated:

 There are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends under federal and state laws, regulations and policies; please see Note 11 Capital and Regulatory Matters in the condensed notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the availability of Bank dividends. 
 Liquidity Sources 
 In addition to cash generated from operations, we utilize a number of funding sources to manage our liquidity, including core deposits, investment securities, cash and cash equivalents, loan repayments, federal funds lines of credit available from other financial institutions, as well as advances from the FHLB. We also have access to the Federal Reserve discount window as a source of short-term funding. 
 Core deposits, which are total deposits excluding time deposits greater than 250,000 and brokered deposits, are a major source of funds used to meet our cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring our liquidity. 
 Our investment portfolio is another source for meeting our liquidity needs. Monthly payments on mortgage-backed securities are used for short-term liquidity, and our investments are generally traded in active markets that offer a readily available source of cash liquidity through sales, if needed. Securities in our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types, such as deposits from state and local municipalities, and can be pledged as collateral for other borrowing sources.

 Other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include long- and short-term advances from the FHLB and unsecured federal funds lines of credit. Long-term funds obtained from the FHLB are primarily used as an alternative source to fund long-term growth of the balance sheet by supporting growth in loans and other long-term interest-earning assets. We typically rely on such funding when the cost of such borrowings compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay for other funding sources, including certain deposits. 
 We also had unsecured federal funds lines of credit available to us, with no amounts outstanding at either September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. These lines of credit primarily provide short-term liquidity and, in order to ensure the availability of these funds, we test these lines of credit at least annually. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. 
 Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow 1.40 billion from the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas FRB ), with 1.61 billion in commercial and industrial loans pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings against this line at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. 
 In the normal course of business as a financial services provider, we enter into financial instruments, such as certain contractual obligations and commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments involve elements of credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Some instruments may not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until they are funded, and a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn, although they expose us to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans. Please see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the condensed notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our off-balance sheet commitments. 
 Stockholders Equity 
 Stockholders equity provides a source of permanent funding, allows for future growth and provides a degree of protection to withstand unforeseen adverse developments. Changes in stockholders equity is reflected below:

 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 Together with the Bank, we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators that, if enforced, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations of the Federal Reserve. As we deploy capital and continue to grow operations, regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on the level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control growth in order to remain well capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines and in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital standards. While we are currently classified as well capitalized, an extended economic recession could adversely impact our reported and regulatory capital ratios.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 SEC guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting estimates. The SEC defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. 
 Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. We have identified certain significant accounting policies which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Please see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our financial management policy provides management with guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring the net interest rate sensitivity position. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short-term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the consolidated balance sheets to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the consolidated balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We may utilize derivative financial instruments as part of an ongoing effort to mitigate interest rate risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations and facilitate the needs of our customers. For more information about our derivative financial instruments, see Note 8 Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Based on the nature of operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank s Asset-Liability Management Committee in accordance with policies approved by the Bank s board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. 
 The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. We employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which includes an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Our interest rate risk modeling incorporates a number of assumptions, including the repricing sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities, asset prepayment speeds, and the expected average life of non-maturity deposits. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain, and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 On a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models, including a static balance sheet and a dynamic growth balance sheet. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously, and ramped rates change over a twelve-month and twenty-four-month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Additionally, we run a non-parallel simulation involving analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Internal policy regarding interest rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10.0 for a 100-basis point shift, 15.0 for a 200-basis point shift, 20.0 for a 300-basis point shift, and 25.0 for a 400-basis point shift. We continue to monitor our asset sensitivity and evaluate strategies to prevent being significantly impacted by future changes in interest rates.

 The following table summarizes the impact of an instantaneous, sustained simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon at the date indicated.

 Change in Net Interest Income 
 Change in Fair Value of Equity 
 +400 12.8 (13.1) +300 9.7 (9.8) +200 6.6 (6.3) +100 3.3 (3.0) Base 
 -100 (3.9) 3.0 -200 (6.0) 6.1 -300 (7.6) 9.5 -400 (7.9) 14.2 
 We have found that, historically, interest rates on deposits do not change completely in tandem with the changes in the discount and federal funds rates. Overall, interest rates on deposits typically experience a lower degree of rate change than changes in market interest rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis, meaning that process by which we measure the gap between interest rate sensitive assets versus interest rate sensitive liabilities. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies. 
 The Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the federal funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the loan and deposit rates offered by financial institutions and the fair value of our available for sale securities. The federal funds target rate range has increased 525 basis points starting with the Federal Reserve Board s first rate increase in March 2022, and in order to remain competitive as market interest rates increased, we increased interest rates paid on our deposits. During September 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target rate range 50 basis points from a 23-year high of 5.25 to 5.50 to 4.75 to 5.00 . 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which presently requires us to measure the majority of our financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. 
 Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the general level of inflation. However, inflation affects financial institutions by increasing their cost of goods and services purchased, as well as the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders equity. In management s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we continually evaluate and seek to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting, and, in this regard, we have recently made certain enhancements designed to identify and mitigate events like the questioned activity by the former banker in East Texas previously discussed in this report. 
 The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
