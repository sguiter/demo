Additionally, as of December 31, 2023 , the Company held cash of and cash equivalents of . 
 and , respec tively, of long-term receivables related to private funds advisory capital raising engagements, which are generally paid in installments over a period of three to . Long-term receivables generated interest income of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that, in management s opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred. For purposes of determining appropriate allowances, the Company stratifies its population of accounts receivable into two categories, one for short-term receivables and a second for private funds advisory receivables. Each population is separately evaluated using an aging method that results in a percentage reserve based on the age of the receivable, in addition to considerations of historical charge-offs and current economic conditions. After concluding that a reserved accounts receivable is no longer collectible, the Company will charge-off the receivable. This has the effect of reducing both the gross receivable and the allowance for credit losses. If a reserved accounts receivable is subsequently collected, such recoveries reduce the gross receivable and the allowance for credit losses and is a reduction of bad debt expense, which is recorded within other expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The combination of recoveries and the provision for credit losses of a reported period comprise the Company s bad debt expense.

, respectively. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated amortization, which is determined using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred. Assets that are in development and have not yet been placed in service are generally classified as Construction in Progress and are reclassified to the appropriate category when the associated assets are placed in service. Equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment when an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If this occurs, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the assets. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and any gain or loss is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to exchanges by its eligible Managing Directors and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of this tax receivable agreement. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining of cash savings, if any, in income tax that it realizes and record any such estimated tax benefits as an increase to additional paid-in-capital. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the Company s actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that it would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Group LP as a result of the exchanges and had it not entered into the tax receivable agreement. The term of the tax receivable agreement commenced upon consummation of the IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on an agreed value of payments remaining to be made under the agreement. The Company has recorded the estimated tax benefits related to the increase in tax basis and imputed interest as a result of the initial purchase and subsequent exchanges described above as a deferred tax asset in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount due to its

Any such awards will continue to vest on their applicable vesting schedule, subject to noncompetition and other terms. Over time a greater number of employees may become retirement eligible and the related requisite service period over which we will expense these awards will be shorter than the stated vesting period. Unvested RSUs and certain stock-based awards are eligible to receive dividends in kind; however, the right to dividends in kind will be forfeited if the underlying award does not vest. 
 unrecognized tax benefit was recorded. To the extent that the Company s assessment of the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions changes as a result of the evaluation of new information, such change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. The Company reports income tax-related interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , such amounts were recorded. The Company recognizes excess tax benefits and deficiencies as income tax benefits or expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. These are reflected in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

We have not included the impact of Class B common stock because these shares are entitled to an insignificant amount of economic participation. (a) Class A partnership units may be exchanged for Moelis Company Class A common stock on a -for-one basis, subject to applicable exchange restrictions. If all Class A partnership units were to be exchanged for Class A common stock, fully diluted Class A common stock outstanding would be shares and shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In computing the dilutive effect, if any, that the aforementioned exchange would have on net income (loss) per share, net income (loss) available to holders of Class A common stock would be adjusted due to the elimination of the noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities associated with the Group LP Class A partnership units (including any tax impact). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such exchange is not reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share as the assumed exchange is not dilutive. (b) Certain RSUs assumed to be issued as Class A common stock pursuant to the treasury stock method were antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to Moelis Company for certain periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were RSUs and RSUs that would have been included in the treasury stock method calculation if the effect were dilutive, respectively, and and RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (c) The Company incurred a loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and as a result the assumed issuance of any Class A common stock pursuant to the treasury stock method is antidilutive.

The Company also issues partnership units that are intended to qualify as "profits interest" for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("Partnership Units") that, subject to certain terms and conditions, are exchangeable into shares of Moelis Company Class A common stock on a -for-one basis. These Partnership Units are recorded as noncontrolling interests in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Partnership Units generally vest over a service life of two to , however in certain arrangements the Partnership Units are granted without a service requirement, but do not have exchange rights until the second through fifth anniversaries of the grant-date. The expense for Partnership Units is recognized over the service period and reflects the fair value determined at grant-date, which may factor in other attributes, such as post-vesting restrictions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company granted and Partnership Units with grant-date fair values of and , respectively. Certain Partnership Units and RSUs vest upon the achievement of both market conditions and service requirements that are generally over three to ("Performance Units"). These units accrue distributions in kind, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying Performance Units. The expense for Performance Units is recognized over the service period and reflects the fair value determined at grant-date, which factors in the probability of the market conditions being achieved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted target Performance Units with a grant-date fair value of . In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted target Performance Units with a grant-date fair value of .

shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO and reorganization.

Contractual Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide indemnification for specified losses, including certain indemnification of certain officers, directors and employees. Legal In the ordinary course of business, from time to time the Company and its affiliates are involved in judicial or regulatory proceedings, arbitration or mediation concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its businesses, including contractual and employment matters. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations conduct periodic examinations, investigations and initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company s business, including, among other matters, compliance, accounting, recordkeeping and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or its directors, officers or employees. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company often cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. For matters where the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of a probable loss, or range of loss, the Company will accrue a loss for such matters in accordance with the U.S. GAAP for the aggregate of the estimated amount or the minimum amount of the range, if no amount within the range is a better estimate. The Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that it is not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company. During 2023, West Palm Beach Firefighters Pension Fund, a putative Class A stockholder of the Company, filed a class action lawsuit, on behalf of itself and other similarly-situated Class A stockholders, in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company seeking declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement between the Company and Partner Holdings are invalid and unenforceable as a matter of Delaware law. On March 4, 2024, the Court of Chancery issued an interlocutory order, presently in effect, that certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, including the provisions relating to approval rights and director vacancies, are facially invalid, void, and unenforceable under Delaware law. On July 18, 2024, the Court of Chancery issued an order awarding plaintiff s counsel in fees and expenses, to be paid by the Company. The Company has filed an appeal of the Court of Chancery orders.

The Company's provisions for income taxes were an expense of and a benefit of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The income taxes for the aforementioned periods primarily reflects the Company s allocable share of operating results from Group LP at the prevailing U.S. federal, state, and local corporate income tax rates and the effect of certain non-tax-deductible items, offset by the effect of the excess tax benefit recognized in connection with the delivery of equity-based compensation at an appreciated price above the grant date price for such equity. The excess tax benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were exchanges of Class A partnership units for Class A common stock in February and July 2024 that resulted in an increase to our deferred tax asset related to a step-up in the tax basis in Group LP assets. Approximately of the increase to this deferred tax asset is attributable to exchanges by certain partners of Group LP who are party to the tax receivable agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, (or of the tax benefits associated with this portion of the deferred tax asset are payable to such exchanging partners over the next years and recorded as amount due pursuant to tax receivable agreement in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The remaining tax benefit is allocable to the Company and is recorded in additional paid-in-capital. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Group LP was selected for examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended December 31, 2020. The Company s tax years for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. Tax examinations are monitored on an ongoing basis and adjustments to tax liabilities are made as appropriate.

Executive Overview Moelis Company is a leading global independent investment bank that provides innovative strategic advice and solutions to a diverse client base, including corporations, governments, and financial sponsors. We assist our clients in achieving their strategic goals by offering comprehensive integrated financial advisory services across all major industry sectors. With over 20 locations in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, we advise clients on their most critical decisions, including mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations and restructurings, capital markets transactions and other corporate finance matters. Our ability to provide confidential, independent advisory services to our clients across sectors and regions and through all phases of the business cycle has led to long-term client relationships and a diversified revenue base. As of September 30, 2024, we served our clients globally with 926 advisory bankers. We generate revenues primarily from providing advisory services on transactions that are subject to individually negotiated engagement letters which set forth our fees. We generally generate fees at key transaction milestones, such as closing, the timing of which is outside of our control. As a result, revenues and net income in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. The performance of our business depends on the ability of our professionals to build relationships with clients over many years by providing trusted advice and exceptional transaction execution. Business Environment and Outlook Economic and global financial conditions can materially affect our operational and financial performance. See Risk Factors in Part II. Other Information of this Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the factors that can affect our performance. The M A market data for announced and completed transactions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, referenced throughout this Form 10-Q was obtained from LSEG - Financial Technology Data (formerly known as Refinitiv) as of October 4, 2024 and October 4, 2023, respectively. For the first nine months of 2024, we earned GAAP revenues of 755.8 million compared with 639.9 million earned during the same period in 2023. This represents an increase of 18 compared to a 5 decline in the number of global completed M A transactions greater than 100 million in the same period. The M A market has been gradually improving throughout 2024 and with the Federal Reserve starting to cut interest rates, we expect to see continued improvement. We are seeing improved client dialogue and engagement as corporate boards continue to seek to use M A and the capital markets as a tool to realize long-term strategic priorities. Additionally, the near record levels of capital accumulated by financial sponsors combined with unsold portfolio companies and a dearth of exits in recent years should provide for increased financial sponsor-related M A over time. Our out-of-court liability management and in-court 

 27 

restructuring mandates remain elevated as a result of higher borrowing costs. We anticipate a prolonged restructuring cycle centered around liability management exercises due to a large amount of non-investment grade debt maturing over the next few years. Improving macroeconomic and investor sentiment has led to better capital raising and financing conditions and our capital markets business continues to provide the full suite of capital raising solutions to our clients across all sectors. Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Revenues We operate in a highly competitive environment. Each revenue-generating engagement is separately solicited, awarded and negotiated, and there are usually no long-term contracted sources of revenue. As a consequence, our fee-paying client engagements are not predictable, and high levels of revenues in one period are not necessarily predictive of continued high levels of revenues in future periods. To develop new business, our professionals maintain an active dialogue with a large number of existing and potential clients. We add new clients each year as our bankers continue to expand their relationships, as we hire senior bankers who bring their client relationships and as we receive introductions from our relationship network of senior executives, board members, attorneys and other third parties. We also lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of clients, changes in clients senior management, competition from other financial services firms and other causes. We earn substantially all of our revenues from advisory engagements, and, in many cases, we are not paid until the completion of an underlying transaction. The vast majority of our advisory revenues are recognized over time, although the recognition of our transaction fees are constrained until the engagement is substantially complete. Complications that may terminate or delay a transaction include failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to obtain required regulatory consents, failure to obtain board or stockholder approvals, failure to secure financing, adverse market conditions or unexpected operating or financial problems related to either party to the transaction. In these circumstances, we often do not receive advisory fees that would have been received if the transaction had been completed, despite the fact that we may have devoted considerable time and resources to the transaction. Barriers to the completion of a restructuring transaction may include a lack of anticipated bidders for the assets of our client, or the inability of our client to restructure its operations, or indebtedness due to a failure to reach agreement with its creditors. In these circumstances, our fees are generally limited to monthly retainer fees and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. We do not allocate our revenue by the type of advice we provide because of the complexity of the transactions on which we may earn revenue and our holistic approach to client service. For example, a restructuring engagement may evolve to require a sale of all or a portion of the client, M A assignments can develop from relationships established on prior restructuring engagements, and capital markets expertise can be instrumental on both M A and restructuring assignments. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 Revenues were 273.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 272.2 million for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 1 . 

 28 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned revenues from 163 clients and 139 clients, respectively, and more importantly, the number of clients that paid fees equal to or greater than 1 million was 67 clients and 48 clients, respectively. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 Revenues were 755.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 639.9 million for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 18 . The increase in revenues was driven by an increase in the number of completed transactions as compared to the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned revenues from 314 clients and 248 clients, respectively, and more importantly, the number of clients that paid fees equal to or greater than 1 million was 177 clients and 129 clients, respectively.

Our operating expenses are classified as compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses account for the majority of our operating expenses. Non-compensation expenses, which include the costs of professional fees, travel and related expenses, communication, technology and information services, occupancy, depreciation and other expenses, generally have been less significant in comparison with compensation and benefits expenses. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 Operating expenses were 258.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and represented 94 of revenues, compared with 292.2 million for the same period in 2023 which represented 107 of revenues. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense associated with a lower target compensation as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 Operating expenses were 714.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and represented 95 of revenues, compared with 670.9 million for the same period in 2023 which represented 105 of revenues. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits expense associated with higher revenues compared to the prior year period. Compensation and Benefits Expenses Our compensation and benefits expenses are determined by management based on revenues earned, the mark-to-market impact on investments where our employees and the Moelis advisory platform contributed meaningfully to the acquisition of the asset, the competitiveness of the prevailing labor market and anticipated compensation requirements for our employees, the level of recruitment of new Managing Directors and other bankers, the amount of compensation expenses amortized related to equity awards and other relevant factors. As a result, our compensation expenses may fluctuate materially in any particular period. Accordingly, the amount of compensation expenses recognized in any particular period may not be consistent with prior periods or indicative of future periods. Our compensation expenses consist of base salary and benefits, annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards, including certain amounts subject to clawback and contingent upon a required period of service contingent cash 

 29 

awards and amortization of equity-based compensation awards. Base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year. Equity awards are amortized into compensation expenses on a graded basis (based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant) during the service period (adjusted for retirement eligibility) over which the award vests, which is typically four or five years. The awards are recorded within equity as they are expensed. Contingent cash awards are amortized into compensation expenses over the required service period. Incentive compensation, which is accrued throughout the year, is discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors including the performance of the Company and is generally awarded and paid during the first two months subsequent to the performance year. The number of equity units granted as a component of the annual incentive award is determined with reference to the Company s grant date fair value. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compensation related expenses of 210.7 million represented 77 of revenues, compared with 242.2 million which represented 89 of revenues in the prior year period. The decrease in compensation expenses was primarily attributable to a lower target compensation as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation related expenses of 573.0 million represented 76 of revenues, compared with 536.3 million which represented 84 of revenues in the prior year period. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily attributable to increased headcount as compared to the prior year period. Non-Compensation Expenses Our non-compensation expenses include the costs of occupancy, professional fees, communication, technology and information services, travel and related expenses, depreciation and other expenses. Historically, our non-compensation expenses have increased as we have increased headcount which results from growing our business. This trend of growth in non-compensation expense may continue as we expand into new sectors, geographies and products to serve our clients growing needs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non compensation expenses of 47.5 million represented 17 of revenues, compared with 50.0 million which represented 18 of revenues in the prior year period. The decrease in non-compensation expenses is primarily due to a decrease in professional fees directly connected to specific transactions, partially offset by increased expenses related to greater headcount as compared to the prior year period. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non compensation expenses of 141.4 million represented 19 of revenues, compared with 134.6 million which represented 21 of revenues in the prior year period. The increase in non-compensation expenses is primarily due to greater headcount as compared to the prior year period. Other Income and Expenses Other income and expenses consists of earnings from equity method investments, gains and losses on investments, interest income and expense, and other infrequent gains or losses. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income and expenses was income of 11.1 million, primarily related to a 7.0 million gain on the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our investment in MA Financial Group Limited ("MA Financial") and 3.9 million in interest and gains on financial assets measured at fair value. For the prior year period, other income and expenses was income of 9.9 million, primarily related to net gains of 7.1 million on financial assets measured at fair market value and 1.4 million in earnings related to the Company's investment in MA Financial. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income and expenses was income of 17.0 million, primarily related to 7.0 million gain on the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our investment in MA Financial and 6.2 million in interest and gains on financial assets measured at fair value and. This compares to income of 6.1 million in the prior year period primarily related to net gains of 9.0 million on financial assets measured at fair market value, 3.5 million in interest and dividends on cash equivalents and investments and income of 3.0 million from the Company's share of earnings in MA Financial, partially offset by the 10.0 million SEC fine. Provision for Income Taxes The Company s operations are comprised of entities that are organized as limited liability companies and limited partnerships. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, taxes related to income earned by these entities represent obligations of their interest holders, except for certain foreign, state and local income taxes (for example, the New York City unincorporated business tax UBT )). The Company is subject to U.S. corporate, federal, state, and local income tax on its allocable share of results of operations from Group LP. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 The Company s provision for income taxes was an expense of 7.4 million against a pre-tax income of 26.7 million and a benefit of 1.3 million against pre-tax loss of 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax provisions for the aforementioned periods primarily reflect the Company s allocable share of operating results from Group LP at the prevailing U.S. federal, state, and local corporate income tax rate, and the effect of certain non-tax-deductible items. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 The Company s provisions for income taxes were a benefit of 6.8 million against a pre-tax income of 58.5 million and a benefit of 3.9 million against a pre-tax loss of 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax provisions for the aforementioned periods primarily reflect the Company s allocable share of operating results from Group LP at the prevailing U.S. federal, state, and local corporate income tax rate, and the effect of certain non-tax-deductible items, offset by the impact of the excess tax benefit recognized in connection with equity-based compensation delivered at a price above the grant date price. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our current assets have historically been comprised of cash, short term liquid investments and receivables related to fees earned from providing advisory services. Our current liabilities are primarily comprised of accrued expenses, including accrued employee compensation. We pay a significant portion of incentive compensation during the first two months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results. We also distribute estimated partner tax payments primarily in the first quarter of each year with respect to the prior year s operating results. Therefore, levels of cash generally decline during the first quarter of each year after incentive compensation has been paid to our employees and estimated tax payments have been distributed to partners. Cash before dividends and share buybacks then typically builds over the remainder of the year. We evaluate our cash needs on a regular basis in light of current market conditions. Cash and cash equivalents include all short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash equivalents of 100.2 million and 137.4 million, respectively, invested primarily in U.S. and U.K. sovereign debt securities, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of 45.1 million and 49.1 million, respectively, maintained in U.S. and non U.S. bank accounts, of which most bank account balances exceeded the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS coverage limits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we hold sovereign debt securities and certificates of deposit that are classified as investments on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as they have original maturities of three months or more from the date of purchase. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held 152.3 million and 162.9 million of sovereign debt securities and certificates of deposit classified as investments, respectively. Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients which generally requires the successful completion of transactions. The timing of receivable collections typically occurs within 60 days of billing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 accounts receivable were 57.8 million and 51.2 million, respectively, net of allowances of 2.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively. 

 31 

To provide for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes, we maintain two revolving credit facilities with aggregate base credit commitments of 50.0 million. The facility for corporate purposes has a base credit commitment of 5.0 million, and we can request a temporary increase of the credit amount by up to 45.0 million additional credit, not to exceed the capacity available under the FINRA credit line discussed below. This option may be exercised up to two times per year during the twelve-month term of the credit line. Unless the lender issues a notice of termination prior to the maturity date of May 24, 2025, this facility will automatically extend to June 30, 2026. The Company incurs a 0.25 per annum fee on the amount of the unused commitment. Advances on the facility bear interest at the greater of a fixed rate of 3.50 per annum or at the Company s option of (i) SOFR plus 1.3 or (ii) Prime minus 1.50 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings under the 5.0 million credit facility and the Company s available credit was 4.4 million as a result of the issuance of an aggregate amount of 0.6 million of various standby letters of credit, which were required in connection with certain office leases and other agreements. In addition, Moelis Company LLC ("U.S. Broker Dealer") maintains a 45.0 million revolving credit facility agreement pre-approved by FINRA to provide additional regulatory capital as necessary. Under the facility, U.S. Broker Dealer may borrow capital until May 23, 2025, the end of the credit period, and must repay aggregate principal balances by the maturity date of May 24, 2026. The Company incurs a 0.25 per annum fee on the amount of the unused commitment. Borrowings on the facility bear interest equal to the Prime rate, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September, and December of each calendar year. U.S. Broker Dealer had no borrowing under the credit facility and the available credit under this facility was 45.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The Board of Directors of Moelis Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0.60 per share. The 0.60 per share will be paid on December 2, 2024 to Class A common stockholders of record on November 4, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company paid aggregate dividends of 1.80 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 181,718 and 1,078,130 shares, respectively, from its employees for the purpose of settling tax liabilities incurred upon delivery of equity-based compensation awards. In July 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of shares of Class A common stock and/or Class A partnership units of Group LP with no expiration date. The dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program was 62.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Regulatory Capital We actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity. This requires, among other things, that we comply with certain minimum capital requirements, record keeping, reporting procedures, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 10 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. These regulations differ in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and other countries in which we operate a registered broker dealer. The license under which we operate in each such country is meant to be appropriate to conduct an advisory business. We believe that we provide each of our subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity, consistent with their business and regulatory requirements. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with the IPO in April 2014, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with our eligible Managing Directors that provides for the payment to eligible Managing Directors of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or franchise tax that we realize as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to exchanges by our eligible Managing Directors and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of this tax receivable agreement. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15 of income tax cash savings, if any, that we realize. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, income tax cash savings will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Group LP as a result of the exchanges and had we not entered into the tax receivable agreement. The term of the tax receivable agreement commenced upon consummation of the IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on an agreed value of payments remaining to be made under the agreement. 

 32 

Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 225 days of the filing of our tax returns. Because we generally expect to receive the tax savings prior to making the cash payments to the eligible selling holders of Group LP partnership units, we do not expect the cash payments to have a material impact on our liquidity. In addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a merger, asset sale, or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, our (or our successor s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control or early termination) will be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, and, in the case of an early termination election, that any units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the Class A common stock at the time of termination. Consequently, it is possible, in these circumstances, that the actual cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments. Cash Flows Our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the amount and timing of receipt of advisory fees, which are generally collected within 60 days of billing, and the payment of operating expenses, including payments of incentive compensation to our employees. We pay a significant portion of incentive compensation during the first two months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results. Our investing and financing cash flows are primarily influenced by activities to fund investments and payments of dividends and estimated partner taxes. A summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows is as follows:

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 146.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 41.1 million from 187.2 million at December 31, 2023. Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of 112.1 million primarily attributable to cash collected from clients, net of cash operating outflows, including bonuses paid during the period. Investing activities resulted in a net inflow of 13.4 million primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of investments. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of 168.1 million primarily related to the payment of dividends and tax distributions. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 148.2 million at September 30, 2023, a decrease of 59.3 million from 207.5 million at December 31, 2022. Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of 59.1 million primarily attributable to cash collected from clients, net of cash operating outflows, including bonuses paid during the period. Investing activities resulted in a net inflow of 64.0 million primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of investments. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of 183.0 million primarily related to the payment of dividends and tax distributions and treasury stock purchases. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a total payable of 290.6 million due pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the condensed consolidated financial statements. There is no payment due in less than one year. These amounts represent management s best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 225 days of the filing of our tax returns. We 

 33 

generally expect to receive the tax savings prior to making the cash payments to the eligible selling holders of Group LP partnership units. The Company made a payment of 20.3 million pursuant to the tax receivable agreement during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, the Company has contractual obligations related to its leases for corporate office space and an aircraft. See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details regarding when these obligations are due. Market Risk and Credit Risk Our business is not capital-intensive and we do not invest in derivative instruments or, generally, borrow through issuing debt. As a result, we are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk) or credit risk. Risks Related to Cash and Short-Term Investments Our cash and cash equivalents include all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. We invest most of our cash in U.S. and U.K. sovereign debt securities and money market securities. Cash is maintained in U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts. Most U.S. and U.K. account balances exceed the FDIC and FSCS coverage limits. Nearly all of our cash balance is held at institutions or at subsidiaries of institutions labeled as global systemically important banks by the Financial Stability Board. Despite the importance of these institutions, there can be no assurance of governmental or regulatory intervention to guarantee our uninsured deposits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we hold sovereign debt securities that are classified as investments on our condensed consolidated statement of financial condition as they have original maturities of three months or more (but less than twelve months) from the date of purchase. We believe our cash and short-term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk. Credit Risk We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay such amounts owed to the Company. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Exchange Rate Risk The Company is exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may have an adverse effect on the reported value of the Company s non U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Non functional currency related transaction gains and losses are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the reported amounts of our revenues and other income from investments may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the pound sterling, euro, Brazilian real, Hong Kong dollar, Israeli shekel, rupee, Australian dollar, Saudi riyal and the U.S. dollar, in which our financial statements are denominated. The net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in other comprehensive income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income were gains of 2.3 million and losses of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and gains of 2.0 million and losses of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates included below represent those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgment. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period for which they are determined to be necessary. 

 34 

Revenue and Expense Recognition We earn substantially all of our revenues by providing advisory services on mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations and restructurings, capital markets transactions, private fund raisings and secondary transactions, and other corporate finance matters. The Company also acts as an underwriter of certain securities offerings. We provide our advisory services on an ongoing basis which, for example, may include evaluating and selecting one of multiple strategies. In many cases, we are not paid until the completion of an underlying transaction. The Company recognizes the vast majority of its advisory services revenue over time, including reimbursements for certain out-of-pocket expenses, when or as our performance obligations are fulfilled and collection is reasonably assured. The determination of whether revenues are recognized over time or at a point in time depends upon the type of service being provided and the related performance obligations. We identify the performance obligations in our engagement letters and determine which services are distinct (i.e. separately identifiable and the client could benefit from such service on its own). We allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations by estimating the amount of consideration we expect in exchange for providing each service. Both the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of transaction price to the respective performance obligations requires significant judgment. During such advisory engagements, our clients are continuously benefitting from our advice and the over time recognition matches the transfer of such benefits. However, the recognition of transaction fees, which are variable in nature, is constrained until substantially all services have been provided, specified conditions have been met (e.g. transaction closing) and it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in a future period. Upfront fees and retainers specified in our engagement letters that meet the over time criteria will be recognized on a systematic basis over the estimated period where the related services are performed. With respect to fairness opinions, fees are fixed and delivering the opinion is a separate performance obligation from other advisory services that may be promised under the same engagement letter; as such these revenues are recognized at a point in time when the engagement is formally completed and the client can obtain substantially all of the benefits from the service. Similarly, underwriting engagements are typically a single performance obligation and fees are generally recognized as revenue when the offering has been deemed to be completed by the lead manager of the underwriting group. In these instances, point in time recognition appropriately matches the transfer and consumption of our services. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred since such costs are generally not recoverable and the typical duration of our advisory contracts is less than one year. Costs to fulfill contracts consist of out-of-pocket expenses that are part of performing our advisory services and are typically expensed as incurred, except where the transfer and consumption of our services occurs at a point in time. For engagements recognized at a point in time, out-of-pocket expenses are capitalized and subsequently expensed in the condensed consolidated statement of operations upon completion of the engagement. The Company records deferred revenues when it receives fees from clients that have not yet been earned (e.g. an upfront fee) or when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration before all performance obligations are complete (e.g. upon satisfying conditions to earn an announcement fee, but before the transaction is consummated). Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition present accounts receivable balances net of allowance for credit losses based on the Company s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that, in management s opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover its current expectation of future losses as of the reporting date. For purposes of determining appropriate allowances, the Company stratifies its population of accounts receivable into two categories, one for short-term receivables and a second for private funds advisory receivables. Each population is separately evaluated using an aging method that results in a percentage reserve based on the age of the receivable, in addition to considerations of historical charge-offs and current economic conditions. After concluding that a reserved accounts receivable is no longer collectible, the Company will charge-off the receivable. This has the effect of reducing both the gross receivable and the allowance for credit losses. If a reserved accounts receivable is subsequently collected, such recoveries reduce the gross receivable and the allowance for credit losses and is a reduction of bad debt expense, which is recorded within other expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The combination of recoveries and the provision for credit losses of a reported period comprise the Company s bad debt expense. 

 35 

Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities by applying the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Such net tax effects on temporary differences are reflected on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC 740 prescribes a two-step approach for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with the positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company has reviewed and will continue to review the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions, which may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no unrecognized tax benefit was recorded. To the extent that the Company s assessment of the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions changes as a result of the evaluation of new information, such change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. The Company reports income tax related interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no such amounts were recorded. Recent Accounting Developments For a discussion of recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth above in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk and Credit Risk. Item 4. Control s and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Controls No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, from time to time the Company and its affiliates are involved in judicial or regulatory proceedings, arbitration or mediation concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its businesses, including contractual and employment matters. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations conduct periodic examinations, investigations and initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company s business, including, among other matters, compliance, accounting, recordkeeping and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or its directors, officers or employees. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company often cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. For matters where the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of a probable loss, or range of loss, the Company will accrue a loss for such matters in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the aggregate of the estimated amount or the minimum amount of the range, if no amount within the range is a better estimate. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that it is not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company. During 2023, West Palm Beach Firefighters Pension Fund, a putative Class A stockholder of the Company, filed a class action lawsuit, on behalf of itself and other similarly-situated Class A stockholders, in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company seeking declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement between the Company and Partner Holdings are invalid and unenforceable as a matter of Delaware law. On March 4, 2024, the Court of Chancery issued an interlocutory order, presently in effect, that certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, including the provisions relating to approval rights and director vacancies, are facially invalid, void, and unenforceable under Delaware law. On July 18, 2024, the Court of Chancery issued an order awarding plaintiff s counsel 6,000 in fees and expenses, to be paid by the Company. The Company has filed an appeal of the Court of Chancery orders. On May 17, 2024, two putative stockholders of Archer Aviation, Inc. Archer (and formerly, Atlas Crest Investment Corp. Atlas Crest )) filed a class action lawsuit, on behalf of themselves and other similarly-situated stockholders, in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the directors and officers of Atlas Crest, Archer, the Archer co-founders, Moelis Company Group LP and Moelis Company LLC. The complaint asserts claims against the defendants for breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties, and unjust enrichment, in connection with the merger between Atlas Crest and Archer, including claims against the foregoing Moelis entities for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs request damages in an amount to be determined at trial, as well as attorneys and experts fees. Relatedly, on June 19, 2024, another putative stockholder of Archer filed a class action lawsuit, on behalf of himself and other similarly-situated stockholders, in the Delaware Court of Chancery asserting similar claims as the aforementioned May 17, 2024 complaint against the same defendants named in that May complaint. The Company anticipates that these related class actions in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be consolidated into a single consolidated class action. Item 1A. Ri sk Factors There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. Item 2.
