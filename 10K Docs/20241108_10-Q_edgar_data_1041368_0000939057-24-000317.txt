Allowance for Credit Losses ACL on Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Each reporting period, the Company assesses each available for sale debt security that is in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis results from a credit loss or other factors. The Company did not record an ACL on available for sale debt securities at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company considered the unrealized losses across the classes of major security-type to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and not reflective of a deterioration in credit value. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings. If the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security, the

 The Company considers its loan portfolio to have very little exposure to sub-prime mortgage loans since the Company has not historically engaged in this type of lending. At September 30, 2024, loans carried at million were pledged as collateral to the FHLB of Des Moines and FRB pursuant to borrowing agreements. Substantially all the Company s business activity is with customers located in the states of Washington and Oregon. Loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to one borrower are generally limited by federal regulation to of the Bank s shareholders equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Bank had loans to any one borrower in excess of the regulatory limit. Troubled Loan Modifications TLM Occasionally, the Company offers modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions or any combination of these. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of the forgiveness is charged-off against the ACL for loans. Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the ACL for loans is adjusted by the same amount. The ACL on modified loans is measured using the same credit loss estimation methods used to determine the ACL for all other loans held for investment. These methods incorporate the post-modification loan terms, as well as defaults and charge-offs associated with historical modified loans. There were loans modified related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were loans past due at September 30, 2024 that had been modified in the previous 12 months. Credit quality indicators : The Company monitors credit risk in its loan portfolio using a risk rating system (on a scale of one to nine) for all commercial (non-consumer) loans. The risk rating system is a measure of the credit risk of the borrower based on their historical, current and anticipated future financial characteristics. The Company assigns a risk rating to each commercial loan at origination and subsequently updates these ratings, as necessary, so that the risk rating continues to reflect the appropriate risk characteristics of the loan. Application of appropriate risk ratings is key to management of loan portfolio risk. In determining the appropriate risk rating, the Company considers the following factors: delinquency, payment history, quality of management, liquidity, leverage, earnings trends, alternative funding sources, geographic risk, industry risk, cash flow adequacy, account practices, asset protection and extraordinary risks. Consumer loans, including custom construction loans, are not assigned a risk rating but rather are grouped into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics. When a consumer loan is delinquent 90 days, it is placed on non-accrual status and assigned a substandard risk rating. Loss factors are assigned to each risk rating and homogeneous pool based on historical loss experience for similar loans. This historical loss experience is adjusted for qualitative factors that are likely to cause the estimated credit losses to differ from the Company s historical loss experience. The Company uses these loss factors to estimate the general component of its allowance for credit losses. Pass These loans have a risk rating between 1 and 4 and are to borrowers that meet normal credit standards. Any deficiencies in satisfactory asset quality, liquidity, debt servicing capacity and coverage are offset by strengths in other areas. The borrower currently has the capacity to perform according to the loan terms. Any concerns about risk factors such as stability of margins, stability of cash flows, liquidity, dependence on a single product/supplier/customer, depth of management, etc. are offset by strengths in other areas. Typically, these loans are secured by the operating assets of the borrower and/or real estate. The borrower s management is considered competent. The borrower has the ability to repay the debt in the normal course of business. Watch These loans have a risk rating of 5 and are included in the pass rating. However, there would typically be some reason for additional management oversight, such as the borrower s recent financial setbacks and/or deteriorating financial position, industry concerns and failure to perform on other borrowing obligations. Loans with this rating are monitored closely in an effort to correct deficiencies.

The ACL for loans is evaluated and calculated on a collective basis for those loans which share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the expected credit losses over the loans contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments. The ACL for loans is calculated for loan segments utilizing loan level information and relevant information from internal and external sources related to past events and current conditions. In addition, the Company incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast. For loans that are individually evaluated, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value (less estimated selling costs, if applicable) of the loan is lower than its carrying value.

Included in the 30-89 days past due loans at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 are million and million, respectively, of fully guaranteed SBA or United States Department of Agriculture USDA loans. These government guaranteed loans are classified as pass rated loans and are not considered to be either nonaccrual or classified loans because based on the guarantee, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and there are no well-defined weaknesses or risk of loss. As a result, these loans were omitted from the required calculation of the ACL for loans.

 reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All the Company s goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performed an impairment assessment as of October 31, 2023 and determined that impairment of goodwill exists. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, the Company would be required to progress to the second step. In the second step, the Company calculates the implied fair value of goodwill and compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. If the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination. The results of the Company s step one test indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was greater than its carrying value, and, therefore, a step two analysis was not required; however, no assurance can be given that the Company s goodwill will not be written down in future periods. The Company completed a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Bank (the reporting unit), exceeds its carrying value at that date.

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments above: Investment securities are included within Level 1 of the hierarchy when quoted prices in an active market for identical assets are available. The Company uses a third-party pricing service to assist the Company in determining the fair value of its Level 2 securities, which incorporates pricing models and/or quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics. Investment securities are included within Level 3 of the hierarchy when there are significant unobservable inputs. For Level 2 securities, the independent pricing service provides pricing information by utilizing evaluated pricing models supported with market data information. Standard inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data from market research publications. The Company s third-party pricing service has established processes for the Company to submit inquiries regarding the estimated fair value. In such cases, the Company s third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of any new market data presented by the Company. The Company s third-party pricing service may then affirm the original estimated fair value or may update the evaluation on a go-forward basis. Management reviews the pricing information received from the third-party pricing service through a combination of procedures that include an evaluation of methodologies used by the pricing service, analytical reviews and performance analysis of the prices against statistics and trends. Based on this review, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted. As necessary, management compares prices received from the pricing service to discounted cash flow models or by performing independent valuations of inputs and assumptions similar to those used by the pricing service in order to help ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. There were assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis at both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024.

 million, which substantially represents the unpaid principal balance of the Company s loans serviced for the FHLMC. The Company believes that the potential for loss under these arrangements is remote. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an ACL for FHLMC loans of . The Bank is a public depository and, accordingly, accepts deposit and other public funds belonging to, or held for the benefit of, Washington and Oregon states, political subdivisions thereof, and municipal corporations. In accordance with applicable state law, in the event of default of a participating bank, all other participating banks in the state collectively assure that no loss of funds are suffered by any public depositor. Generally, in the event of default by a public depository, the assessment attributable to all public depositories is allocated on a pro rata basis in proportion to the maximum liability of each depository as it existed on the date of loss. The Company did not incur any losses related to public depository funds for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees, which provide for contingent payments subject to future events. Litigation The Company is periodically involved in litigation arising from the ordinary course of business, some of which may involve claims for substantial or uncertain amounts. At least quarterly, we assess liabilities and contingencies related to all outstanding or new legal matters based on the most recent information available. If a loss is not probable, or the amount cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. When a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated, an accrual for the loss is established and adjusted as necessary to reflect any subsequent developments. Estimating the amount of loss is inherently difficult and there may be cases where a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Actual losses may exceed any established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss and management s estimates may change over time. Determining the future resolution of legal matters involves significant judgment and uncertainty, and it is usually difficult to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is remote, reasonably likely, or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss, until relatively late in the process. The Company was involved in litigation with a former business client concerning real estate investments offered by a business owned by that client. In May 2023, the parties participated in mediation, after which a stay of proceedings was issued to facilitate continued settlement discussions. As of March 31, 2024, based on available information, including the likelihood of a proposed global settlement, management determined that a loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated. Consequently, the Company recorded a million expense in other non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This amount reflected the Company s estimate of litigation costs exceeding its insurance coverage. The settlement was subsequently approved by all relevant courts in July 2024 and the final settlement payment of million was made in August 2024, fully releasing the Company from all claims related to the litigation. In September 2024, the Company received approximately in legal expense recovery related to the settled litigation matter of which approximately was recorded in non-interest income and was recorded as a recovery of legal expenses through the line item of professional fees in non-interest expense.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This report contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). These measures include net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company s performance. The tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis, and accordingly believes that providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison purposes. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Executive Overview As a progressive, community-oriented financial services business, the Company emphasizes local, personal service to residents of its primary market area. The Company considers Clark, Klickitat and Skamania counties of Washington, and Multnomah, Washington and Marion counties of Oregon as its primary market area. The Company is engaged predominantly in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds in its primary market area to originate commercial business, commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, land, real estate construction, residential real estate and other consumer loans. Additionally, the Company, from time to time, will purchase commercial business loans as a way to supplement loan originations and diversify the commercial loan portfolio. These loans are originated by a third-party located outside the Company s primary market area. The Company also purchases the guaranteed portion of SBA loans to help loan portfolio diversification, supplement loan originations and generate a higher yield than overnight cash investments or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside the Company s primary market area and are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. The Company s loans receivable, net, totaled 1.05 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.01 billion at March 31, 2024. The Bank's subsidiary, Riverview Trust Company (the Trust Company ), is a trust and financial services company with one office located in downtown Vancouver, Washington and one office in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The Trust Company provides full-service brokerage activities, trust and asset management services. The Bank s Business and Professional Banking Division, with two lending offices in Vancouver and one in Portland, offers commercial and business banking services. The Company s strategic plan includes targeting the commercial banking customer base in its primary market area for loan originations and deposit growth, specifically small and medium size businesses, professionals and wealth building individuals. In pursuit of these goals, the Company will seek to increase the loan portfolio consistent with its strategic plan and asset/liability and regulatory capital objectives, which includes maintaining a significant amount of commercial business and commercial real estate loans in its loan portfolio which typically carry adjustable rates, higher yields and shorter terms, as well as higher credit risk compared to traditional fixed-rate consumer real estate one-to-four family loans.

 The strategic plan also stresses increased emphasis on non-interest income, including increased fees for asset management services through the Trust Company and deposit service charges. The strategic plan is designed to enhance earnings, reduce interest rate risk and provide a more complete range of financial services to customers and the local communities the Company serves. We believe we are well positioned to attract new customers and to increase our market share through our 17 branches, including, among others, ten in Clark County, three in the Portland metropolitan area and three lending centers. Vancouver is located in Clark County, Washington, which is just north of Portland, Oregon. Many businesses are located in the Vancouver area because of the favorable tax structure and lower energy costs in Washington as compared to Oregon. Companies located in the Vancouver area include: Sharp Microelectronics, Hewlett Packard, Georgia Pacific, Underwriters Laboratory, WaferTech, Barrett Business Services, PeaceHealth and Banfield Pet Hospitals, as well as several support industries. In addition to this industry base, the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area and the Portland metropolitan area are sources of tourism. Operating Strategy Fiscal year 2025 marks the 101 st anniversary since the Bank began operations in 1923. The primary business strategy of the Company is to provide comprehensive banking and related financial services within its primary market area focusing on commercial and real estate construction lending. At September 30, 2024, commercial and real estate construction loans represented 89.3 of total loans compared to 90.4 at March 31, 2024. Commercial lending, including commercial real estate loans, typically has higher credit risk, greater interest margins and shorter terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio's profitability. The Company s goal is to deliver returns to shareholders by increasing higher-yielding assets (in particular, commercial real estate and commercial business loans), increasing core deposit balances, managing problem assets, reducing expenses, hiring experienced employees with a commercial lending focus and exploring expansion opportunities. The Company seeks to achieve these results by focusing on the following objectives. Execution of our Business Plan . The Company is focused on increasing its loan portfolio, especially higher yielding commercial and real estate construction loans, and its core deposits by expanding its customer base throughout its primary market areas. By emphasizing total relationship banking, the Company intends to deepen the relationships with its customers and increase individual customer profitability through cross-marketing programs, which allows the Company to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers. To build its core deposit base, the Company will continue to utilize additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. The Company will also continue to seek to expand its franchise through de novo branches, the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and whole bank transactions that meet its investment and market objectives. In fiscal year 2021, the Company ceased originating residential real estate loans; however, it will from time to time purchase these loans consistent with asset/liability objectives. Maintaining Strong Asset Quality . The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The Company has actively managed delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts, marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, and through work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. The Company s approach to credit management uses well defined policies and procedures and disciplined underwriting criteria resulting in our strong asset quality and credit metrics. Although the Company intends to prudently increase the percentage of its assets consisting of higher-yielding commercial real estate, real estate construction and commercial business loans, which offer higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the Company intends to manage credit exposure using experienced bankers in these areas and a conservative approach to its lending.

 Introduction of New Products and Services . The Company continuously reviews new products and services to provide its customers with more financial options. All new technology and services are generally reviewed for business development and cost saving purposes. The Company continues to experience growth in customer use of its online banking services, where the Bank provides a full array of traditional cash management products as well as online banking products including mobile banking, mobile deposit, bill pay, e-statements, and text banking. The products are tailored to meet the needs of small to medium size businesses and households in the markets we serve. The Company intends to selectively add other products to further diversify revenue sources and to capture more of each customer s banking relationship by cross selling loan and deposit products and additional services, including services provided through the Trust Company to increase its fee income. Assets under management by the Trust Company totaled 871.6 million and 961.8 million at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Attracting Core Deposits and Other Deposit Products . The Company offers personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less likely to be withdrawn when interest rates fluctuate. To build its core deposit base, the Company has sought to reduce its dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost core deposits to fund loan growth and decrease its reliance on other wholesale funding sources, including FHLB and FRB advances. The Company believes that its continued focus on building customer relationships will help to increase the level of core deposits and locally-based retail certificates of deposit. In addition, the Company intends to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet its target business customers needs. The Company maintains technology-based products, such as personal financial management and business remote deposit products, to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits which enable it to meet its customers cash management needs and compete effectively with banks of all sizes. Recruiting and Retaining Highly Competent Personnel with a Focus on Commercial Lending . The Company s ability to continue to attract and retain banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of its markets will be a key to its success. The Company believes that it enhances its market position and adds profitable growth opportunities by focusing on hiring and retaining experienced bankers focused on owner occupied commercial real estate and commercial lending, and the deposit balances that accompany these relationships. The Company emphasizes to its employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking opportunities to build further relationships with its customers. The goal is to compete with other financial service providers by relying on the strength of the Company s customer service and relationship banking approach. The Company believes that one of its strengths is that its employees are also shareholders through the Company s employee stock ownership ESOP and 401(k) plans.

The Company s cash balances typically fluctuate based upon funding needs, deposit activity and investment securities activity. Based on the Company s asset/liability management program and liquidity objectives, the Company may deploy excess cash to purchase investment securities depending on the rate environment and other considerations. As a part of this strategy, the Company may choose to invest in short-term certificates of deposit held for investment, all of which are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). Investment securities totaled 354.9 million and 372.7 million at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The decrease was due to normal pay downs, calls and maturities of investment securities. The Company had no sales of investment securities during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s investment securities primarily consist of a combination of securities backed by government agencies (FHLMC, FNMA, SBA or GNMA). At September 30, 2024, the Company determined that none of its investment securities required an allowance for credit losses ACL ).

 Loans receivable, net, totaled 1.05 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.01 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of 36.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in real estate construction loans of 15.0 million, other installment loans of 14.5 million, multi-family loans of 7.9 million and commercial business loans of 7.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loans of 10.0 million. The Company no longer originates one-to-four family mortgage loans; however, will from time to time purchase these loans consistent with its asset/liability objectives. Additionally, the Company will purchase commercial business loans and consumer loans to supplement loan originations and diversify the loan portfolio. Purchased loans are originated by a third-party located outside the Company s primary market area. Commercial business loans purchased at September 30, 2024 totaled 24.7 million compared to 27.2 million at March 31, 2024. Consumer loans purchased at September 30, 2024 totaled 14.6 million compared to none at March 31, 2024. The Company also purchases the guaranteed portion of SBA loans to help loan portfolio diversification, supplement loan originations and generate a higher yield than overnight cash investments or short-term investments. These SBA loans are originated through another financial institution located outside the Company s primary market area and are purchased with servicing retained by the seller. At September 30, 2024, the Company s purchased SBA loan portfolio was 50.0 million compared to 51.0 million at March 31, 2024. Deposits increased 5.8 million to 1.24 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.23 billion at March 31, 2024 due to a concentrated effort by the Company to retain and increase deposits in light of the strong competition for deposits in its market area. Certificates of deposit and money market accounts increased 38.2 and 18.3 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 22.6 million in interest bearing accounts, 20.2 million in regular savings accounts and 8.0 million in non-interest-bearing accounts. The Company had no wholesale-brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. Core branch deposits accounted for 98.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 98.0 at March 31, 2024. The Company plans to continue its focus on core deposits and on building customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased 1.6 million to 17.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 16.2 million at March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an outstanding balance in Trust sweep funds of 4.7 million at September 30, 2024 that were subsequently disbursed the following business day. This increase was partially offset by decreases of 1.5 million in other accrued expenses and 845,000 in dividends payable. FHLB advances increased 14.0 million to 102.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 88.3 million at March 31, 2024. FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 were comprised of overnight advances and short-term borrowings of 77.3 million and 25.0 million, respectively. FHLB advances at March 31, 2024 were comprised of overnight advances. FHLB advances were utilized to fund new loan originations. Shareholders' equity increased 5.2 million to 160.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 155.6 million at March 31, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to net income of 2.5 million and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the change in unrealized holding losses on securities available for sale, net of tax, of 3.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling 843,000. Capital Resources The Bank is a state-chartered, federally insured institution subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banks. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Table of Contents 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, core capital to total assets and tangible capital to tangible assets (set forth in the table below). Management believes the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the FDIC s regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The Bank s actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios were as follows at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): 

Well Capitalized For Capital Under Prompt Actual Adequacy Purposes Corrective Action Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio September 30, 2024 Total Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 176,525 16.13 87,525 8.0 109,406 10.0 Tier 1 Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 162,824 14.88 65,644 6.0 87,525 8.0 Common equity tier 1 Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 162,824 14.88 49,233 4.5 71,114 6.5 Tier 1 Capital (Leverage): (To Average Tangible Assets) 162,824 10.72 60,750 4.0 75,937 5.0 March 31, 2024 Total Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 173,521 16.32 85,080 8.0 106,350 10.0 Tier 1 Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 160,197 15.06 63,810 6.0 85,080 8.0 Common equity tier 1 Capital: (To Risk-Weighted Assets) 160,197 15.06 47,857 4.5 69,127 6.5 Tier 1 Capital (Leverage): (To Average Tangible Assets) 160,197 10.29 62,296 4.0 77,870 5.0 In addition to the minimum common equity tier 1 CET1 ), Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The capital conservation buffer is required to be an amount greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s CET1 capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer at an amount greater than 2.5 . For a bank holding company, such as the Company, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis. The Federal Reserve expects the holding company s subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies at September 30, 2024, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. At periodic intervals, the Company s banking regulators routinely examine the Company s financial condition and risk management processes as part of their legally prescribed oversight. Based on their examinations, these regulators can direct that the Company s consolidated financial statements be adjusted in accordance with their findings. A future examination could include a review of certain transactions or other amounts reported in the Company s fiscal 2025 consolidated financial statements. Liquidity Liquidity is essential to our business. The objectives of the Bank s liquidity management are to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals, to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers, and to fund ongoing operations. Core relationship deposits are the primary source of the Bank s liquidity. As such, the Bank focuses on deposit relationships with local consumer and business clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the Bank.

Table of Contents 
 Liquidity management is both a short and long-term responsibility of the Company's management. The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management's assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected loan sales, (iii) expected deposit flows, (iv) yields available on interest-bearing deposits and (v) its asset/liability management program objectives. Excess liquidity is invested generally in interest-bearing overnight deposits and other short-term government and agency obligations. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has additional diversified and reliable sources of funds with the FHLB, the FRB and other wholesale facilities. These sources of funds may be used on a long or short-term basis to compensate for a reduction in other sources of funds or on a long-term basis to support lending activities. The Company's primary sources of funds are customer deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, maturing securities, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Management believes that its focus on core relationship deposits coupled with access to borrowings through reliable counterparties provides reasonable and prudent assurance that ample liquidity is available. However, depositor or counterparty behavior could change in response to competition, economic or market situations or other unforeseen circumstances, which could have liquidity implications that may require different strategic or operational actions. The Company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for loan originations, deposit withdrawals, continuing operations, satisfaction other financial commitments, and to take advantage of investment opportunities. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities totaled 164.0 million, or 10.6 of total assets. Management believes that the Company s security portfolio is of high quality and its securities would therefore be marketable. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Company s operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and short-term investments to meet short-term liquidity needs; however, its primary liquidity management practice is to manage short-term borrowings, consistent with its asset/liability objectives. In addition to these primary sources of funds, the Bank has several secondary borrowing sources available to meet potential funding requirements, including FRB borrowings and FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no advances from the FRB and maintains a credit facility with the FRB with an available borrowing capacity of 299.5 million, subject to sufficient collateral. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had advances totaling 102.3 million from the FHLB and had an additional borrowing capacity of 167.5 million with the FHLB, subject to sufficient collateral and stock investment. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had sufficient unpledged collateral to allow it to utilize its available borrowing capacity from the FRB and the FHLB. Borrowing capacity may, however, fluctuate based on acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion. An additional source of wholesale funding includes brokered certificates of deposit. While the Company has utilized brokered deposits from time to time, historically it has not extensively relied on brokered deposits to fund its operations. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Bank had no wholesale brokered deposits. The Bank also participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS deposit products, which allow the Company to accept deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit for depositors while obtaining pass-through insurance for total deposits. The Bank s CDARS and ICS balances were 37.4 million, or 3.0 of total deposits, and 39.6 million, or 3.2 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The combination of all the Bank s funding sources gives the Bank available liquidity of 820.8 million, or 53.0 of total assets at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total commitments of 128.8 million, which includes commitments to extend credit of 14.9 million, unused lines of credit totaling 82.1 million, undisbursed real estate construction loans totaling 30.3 million, and standby letters of credit totaling 1.6 million. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 220.1 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature. Offsetting these cash outflows are scheduled loan and investment securities maturities of less than one year totaling 41.4 million and 24.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024.

 The Company incurs capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during the remainder of fiscal 2025 we expect cash expenditures of approximately 339,000 for capital investment in premises and equipment. For further information regarding the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations, see Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Riverview Bancorp, Inc., as a separate legal entity from the Bank, must provide for its own liquidity. Sources of capital and liquidity for Riverview Bancorp, Inc. include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory notice. Management currently expects to continue the Company s current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on its common stock subject to the Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. The current quarterly common stock dividend rate is 0.02 per share, as approved by the Board of Directors, which management believes is a dividend rate per share that will enable the Company to balance multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a substantial portion of the Company s cash to its shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal 2025 at this rate of 0.02 per share, average total dividends paid each quarter would be approximately 422,000 based on the number of the Company s outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, Riverview Bancorp, Inc. had 8.1 million in cash to meet its liquidity needs. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were 450,000 or 0.03 of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 178,000 or 0.01 of total assets at March 31, 2024. At September 30, 2024, SBA and United States Department of Agriculture USDA government guaranteed loans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest included in nonperforming assets totaled 301,000 compared to 5,000 at March 31, 2024. The Company expects to receive all principal and interest since the Company purchased the guaranteed portion of these loans which is backed by government guaranteed interest certificates. The Company had no other real estate owned or foreclosed assets at September 30, 2024 or March 31, 2024. The following table sets forth information regarding the Company s nonperforming loans, consisting of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent, at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 100,000 compared to none for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The coverage ratio of the ACL for loans to nonperforming loans was 3436.89 at September 30, 2024 compared to 8631.46 at March 31, 2024. The Company s general valuation allowance to pooled or collectively evaluated loans was 1.46 at September 30, 2024 and 1.50 at March 31, 2024.

 Management considers the ACL for loans and unfunded loan commitments to be adequate at September 30, 2024 based on an evaluation of various factors affecting the loan portfolio. The Company believes it has established its current ACL in accordance with GAAP, however, a material increase in the ACL may be required if there is a deterioration in national or local economic conditions (including those driven by inflation or recession), results of regulatory examinations, or other relevant factors. Such an increase could negatively impact the Company s future financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since future events affecting borrowers and collateral values cannot be predicted with certainty, there is no guarantee that the current ACL will remain adequate. Significant increases in the ACL may be necessary if the quality of loans decline or if collateral values decrease, as discussed elsewhere in this document. For further information regarding the Company s individually evaluated loans and ACL for loans and unfunded loan commitments, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

The increase in loans delinquent 30-89 days was primarily attributable to one commercial real estate loan totaling 3.6 million which is due to a circumstance where the loan is in the probate process. A plan is in place to bring the loan current once the probate process is completed, and no loss is expected. At September 30, 2024, CRE loans represented the largest portion of the loan portfolio at 54.05 of total loans and commercial business represented 22.33 of total loans. Goodwill Valuation Goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units, the Bank and the Trust Company, for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment. All the Company s goodwill has been allocated to the Bank reporting unit. The Company performs an annual review in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and additional analysis must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the Company would allocate the fair value to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2023. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach, the income approach, the whole bank transaction approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The results of the Company s step one test indicated that the reporting unit s fair value was greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists. The Company also completed a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Bank (the reporting unit), exceeds its carrying value at that date. Even though the Company determined that there was no goodwill impairment, a sustained decline in the value of its stock price as well as values of other financial institutions, declines in revenue for the Company beyond our current forecasts, significant adverse changes in the operating environment for the financial industry or an increase in the value of our assets without an increase in the value of the reporting unit may result in a future impairment charge.

Table of Contents 
 It is also possible that changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management s judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill, could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill. If the Company recorded an impairment charge, its financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected; however, such an impairment charge would have no impact on our liquidity, operations or regulatory capital. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Income. Net income was 1.6 million, or 0.07 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.5 million, or 0.12 per diluted share for the same period in the prior year. Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.5 million, or 0.12 per diluted share, and 5.3 million, or 0.25 per diluted share, respectively. The Company s net income decreased during both the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due primarily to increased interest paid on deposits. In addition, net income was also impacted, to a lesser extent, by an increase in non-interest expense of 612,000 and 1.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of 434,000 and 516,000 for the same periods, respectively. Net Interest Income. The Company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income it receives on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. When the rate earned on interest-earning assets equals or exceeds the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, this positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. The Company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government legislation and regulation, and monetary and fiscal policies. Net interest income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million and 17.8 million, representing a decrease of 909,000 and 2.4 million, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease during both the three and six month periods was primarily due to increased interest expense on deposits. Net interest margin for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.46 , compared to 2.63 and 2.71 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily attributed to the increase in interest expense and the decrease in total average interest earning assets. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.9 million and 29.3 million, respectively, compared to 14.0 million and 28.0 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in interest income on loans receivable of 1.3 million and 2.1 million, respectively, when compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted from an increase in the average yield earned on loans and, to a lesser extent, the overall increase in the average balance of net loans. Interest and fees earned on net loans increased by 1.3 million and 2.1 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the overall increases in the average balance and yield earned on mortgage loans. The average yield on loans increased to 4.80 and 4.75 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.51 for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on mortgage related loans increased to 4.78 and 4.75 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.47 and 4.48 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The average balance of net loans increased to 1.05 billion and 1.04 billion for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 1.01 billion and 1.00 billion for the comparable periods in the prior year, respectively. The average balance of mortgage loans increased 34.2 million and 27.7 million to 783.8 million and 778.4 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 749.6 million and 750.7 million for the same periods in the prior year.

 Interest earned on investment securities decreased 387,000 and 750,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the average balance of investment securities of 87.6 million and 86.2 million to 378.4 million and 384.8 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 466.0 million and 471.0 million for the same periods in the prior year. During the last quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company restructured a portion of its balance sheet by selling approximately 46.2 million of its lower-yielding available for sale investment securities. The remaining decrease is attributable to normal paydown activities. The average yield on investment securities was 2.05 and 2.08 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.00 and 2.02 for the same periods in the prior year. The increase in yield is related to the sales of lower-yielding securities as previously discussed. Interest Expense. Interest expense totaled 6.0 million and 11.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 million and 7.8 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense on deposits increased 2.0 million and 4.1 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average rates paid on certificates of deposits, interest checking accounts and money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, the average balance of certificates of deposit and interest checking accounts. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased 120 basis points and 126 basis points to 3.89 and 3.78 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods for the prior year. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased 64.4 million and 63.3 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The average rate paid on interest checking accounts increased 107 basis points and 106 basis points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The average balance of interest checking accounts increased 23.9 million and 23.0 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The average rate paid on money market accounts increased 62 basis points and 69 basis points for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a 31.7 million and 27.2 million decrease in the average balance of money market accounts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Interest expense on borrowings decreased 207,000 and 301,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances. The average balance of FHLB advances was 114.5 million and 113.1 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 131.1 million and 130.5 million for the same periods in the prior year. The average rate paid on FHLB advances was 5.44 and 5.52 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 5.39 and 5.31 for the same periods in the prior year.

 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income of the Company for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. Variances that were insignificant have been allocated based upon the percentage relationship of changes in volume and changes in rate to the total net change (in thousands).

 Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 100,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023.The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the overall increase in the loan portfolio. The lack of provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 reflects assumptions related to our forecast concerning the economic environment as a result of local, national and global events. In addition, expected loss estimates consider various factors, including customer-specific information, changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies, and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers' ability to repay. Net recoveries totaled 2,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This compares to net recoveries of 3,000 and net charge-offs of 5,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Annualized net charge-offs/recoveries were insignificant for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. A further decline in national and local economic conditions, as a result of the effects of inflation, and a potential recession or slowed economic growth, among other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for credit losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for credit losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Nonperforming loans were 450,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 178,000 at March 31, 2024. Included in the 450,000 of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, were 301,000 of SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans. The Company expects to receive all principal and interest on these SBA and USDA loans since the Company purchased the guaranteed portion of the loans which is backed by government guaranteed interest certificates. The ratio of the ACL for loans to nonperforming loans was 3436.89 at September 30, 2024 compared to 8631.46 at March 31, 2024. See Asset Quality above for additional information related to asset quality that management considers in determining the appropriate level of the ACL. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 434,000 and 516,000 to 3.8 million and 7.2 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3.4 million and 6.7 million for the same periods in the prior year. The increase for both periods were primarily due to approximately 500,000 in other non-interest income related to a legal expense recovery related to the settled litigation matter from the prior year. In addition, asset management fees income increased by 160,000 and 337,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to new client relationships and a strong equity market performance during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. Other changes in non-interest income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year included a decrease of 214,000 and 274,000 in fees and service charges. The decrease in fees and service charges for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a 167,000 decrease in employee retention credit income and a decrease in interchange income of 45,000 and 68,000, respectively. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 612,000 and 1.6 million to 10.7 million and 21.7 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 10.1 million and 20.1 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits increased 632,000 and 977,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increases in compensation expense and bonus expense. Occupancy and depreciation expense increased by 272,000 and 584,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to increases in computer software, depreciation, repair and maintenance expenses as the Company continues to update and modernize branch locations, and a one-time lease termination fee incurred in September 2024 as a result of the Company purchasing the Orchards location. Other changes in non-interest expense was an increase of 186,000 in professional fees for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in consulting expense. Offsetting these fluctuations was a decrease in other non-interest expense of 318,000 and 201,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to excess accrued expenses related to litigation that was recognized in the prior year and an increase in fraud recoveries, partially offset by additional accruals for business and occupation taxes. For further information regarding the litigation, see Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies . Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes was 425,000 and 678,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 697,000 and 1.5 million for the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to lower pre-tax income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was 21.4 and 21.2 , respectively, compared to 22.0 and 22.2 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is due to lower pretax income. At September 30, 2024, management deemed that a valuation allowance related to the Company s deferred tax asset was not necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of 8.7 million compared to 9.8 million at March 31, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in the 2024 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) and several other members of the Company s senior management. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as in effect on September 30, 2024 were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not make any changes in its internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these controls. While the Company believes the present design of its disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements attributable to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
