 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements generally are identified
by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, 
 intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will
be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which
could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to:
changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted
accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance
should not be placed on such statements. 

Company Overview 

We
have not yet commenced any material operations. The Company plans to build a 14 MW Bitcoin mining facility in Georgia U.S. specifically
designed for hosting cryptocurrency mining equipment and mining Bitcoin for our own account. Cryptocurrency
mining (e.g. bitcoin mining) entails running ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) servers or other specialized servers which
solve a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to a blockchain and thereby confirm digital asset
transactions. A party which is successful in adding a block to the blockchain is awarded a fixed number of digital assets in return. 

At
this time, we own no real estate. Since our inception, June 30, 2021, we have not generated any revenues. 

In
order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of 200,000 in funding. At present,
we plan to to acquire the aforementioned funding from the sale of our common stock pursuant to a Tier II Regulation A Offering we seek
to conduct in the near future. At present, the Offering Statement pursuant to the Tier II Regulation Offering remains in review by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not yet qualified. The Offering Circular and related documentation was filed on April 29, 2024.
At this time, we cannot accurately forecast when the Offering may be qualified and or subsequently conducted. 

The
number of computers that we may purchase or lease for mining bitcoin will depend on how quickly we are able to raise funds through the
aforementioned Offering and the amounts that we are ultimately able to raise. We expect the proceeds from the Offering will be sufficient
for us to implement our business plan and that no additional funding will be needed to implement our business plan, however there is no
guarantee that this may be the case. We may be unsuccessful in raising any capital from the Offering, and thus we may need to seek out
alternate sources of financing. The scalability of our business plan also depends entirely on our ability to secure funds for future operations
and the amount of funds at our disposal. At this time we do not have the needed funding to implement our business plan in any capacity. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash balance is 0 as of September 30, 2024, and
 0 as of June 30, 2024. 

We rely upon our sole officer and director, Levi
Jacobson, for funding. Mr. Jacobson has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the
company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we will require further funding. Being a
start-up stage company, we have very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but
currently do not have any arrangements for such financing. 

On July 5, 2023, we filed a Regulation A Tier
II Offering, which is not yet qualified with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whereas we are seeking to raise capital from the
sale of our Common Stock. There is no guarantee however, that we will raise any monies from the offering. 

If we need additional cash and cannot raise
it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations entirely. 

The Company s sole officer and director, Levi Jacobson, paid expenses on behalf of the Company totaling 7,754 during the period
ended September 30, 2024. These payments are considered as a loan to the Company which is noninterest-bearing, unsecured and payable on
demand. 

As of September 30, 2024, the related party loan
to the Company totaled 68,968. The Company s sole officer and director, Levi Jacobson, paid expenses on behalf of the company
totaling 30,050 during the period ended June 30, 2024. These payments are considered as a loan to the Company which is
noninterest-bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. 

As of June 30, 2024, the related party loan to the
Company totaled 61,214. 

 Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 7,784 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 9,550 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net loss for both periods was
comprised entirely of general and administrative expenses. 

Going Concern 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these financial
statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, no revenue, operating loss, working capital deficiency, and
other adverse key financial ratios. 

The Company has not established a source of revenue
to cover its operating costs. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and our chief financial officer, Levi Jacobson, (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal
financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, who also serves as our chief financial
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our sole officer concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to material
weaknesses identified below. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination
of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief
Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into
the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
