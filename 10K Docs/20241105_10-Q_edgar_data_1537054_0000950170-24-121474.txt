As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Facilities was million and million, respectively. On April 30, 2021, Gogo, GIH, and each direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of GIH (Gogo and such subsidiaries collectively, the Guarantors entered into a guarantee agreement (the Guarantee Agreement in favor of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral agent (the Collateral Agent ), whereby GIH and the Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Guarantee Agreement, and GIH and the Guarantors entered into a collateral agreement (the Collateral Agreement ), in favor of the Collateral Agent, whereby GIH and the Guarantors grant a security interest in substantially all of their respective tangible and intangible assets (including the equity interests in each direct material wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary owned by GIH or any Guarantor, and 65 of the equity interests in any non-U.S. subsidiary held directly by GIH or any Guarantor), subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Collateral Agreement. 

 million for million. The cost of the interest rate caps will be amortized to interest expense using the caplet method, from the effective date through termination date. The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps. 

We record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense in the event the hedges are no longer considered effective, in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . gains or losses of our cash flow hedges

 million in net unrealized losses from our cash flow hedges were considered to be ineffective and reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings. The unrealized loss was offset with an unrealized gain from the previous quarter for a net impact for nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The ineffective portion was the result of a voluntary partial de-designation of the hedge relationship related to a prepayment of our existing variable-rate debt discussed in Note 8, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities. We estimate that approximately million currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. We assess the effectiveness of the hedges on an ongoing basis, and the remaining outstanding caps are still considered to be highly effective, and remain designated as a cash flow hedge. Cash flows from interest rate caps are classified in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as investing activities. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a decrease in fair value on the interest rate caps of million, net of tax of million, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a decrease in fair value on the interest rate caps of million, net of tax of million. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a decrease in fair value on the interest rate caps of million, net of tax of million and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 , we recorded a decrease in fair value on the interest rate caps of million, net of tax of million . Increases and decreases in fair value on interest rate caps above exclude amortization of the purchase price paid for the interest rate caps. When derivatives are used, we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties; however, non-performance is not anticipated. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of the interest rate derivatives are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from commercial banks (based on significant observable inputs - Level 2 inputs).

 Other non-current assets 

Fair Value Measurement Our derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of interest rate caps, which are carried at fair value based on significant observable inputs (Level 2 inputs). Derivatives entered into by us are typically executed over-the-counter and are valued using discounted cash flows along with fair value models that primarily use market observable inputs. These models take into account a variety of factors including, where applicable, maturity, interest rate yield curves, and counterparty credit risks.

million in a convertible note offering Investment in Convertible Note ). The Investment in Convertible Note accrues interest at per annum, payable upon maturity of the note or upon conversion, and matures two years after the date of issuance. We have elected to measure our Investment in Convertible Note using the fair value option and record changes in fair value, including accrued interest, in Other (income) expense, net on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company elected the fair value option for the Investment in Convertible Note to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models. The fair value of the Investment in Convertible Note is measured using Level 3 (unobservable) inputs. The Company, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, determined the fair value using a binomial lattice model. The significant assumptions used in the model include the yield, equity volatility, outstanding principal, remaining term, stated interest rate, risk-free interest rate and the current publicly available stock price. The yield is estimated using similar security yields for companies with similar credit ratings. Equity volatility is estimated based on observed equity volatility for similar companies. The outstanding principal, remaining term and stated interest rate are all determined based on contractually defined terms and the risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the remaining time to maturity.

Long-Term Debt: As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our only financial asset and liability disclosed but not measured at fair value is the Term Loan Facility, which is reflected on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since it is based on quoted market prices of our instrument in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Facility by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume this obligation. The upfront cash payment used in the calcula tion of fair value on our September 30, 2024 Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding any issuance costs, is the amount that a market participant would be willing to lend at such date to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and that would allow such an entity to achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the Term Loan Facility.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to deferred tax adjustments and tax benefits related to domestic research and development tax credits, partially offset by state income taxes. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , our effective income tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and stock-based compensation partially offset by tax benefits related to domestic research and development tax credits and deferred tax adjustments. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of due to a partial release of the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets, partially offset by state income taxes. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. In our assessments, the Company considers recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of our net operating losses, future taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, and tax planning strategies. The remaining valuation allowance is still required for deferred tax assets related to certain state credits, foreign net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards as it is more likely than not as of September 30, 2024 that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and many states, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

 , SmartSky Networks, LLC brought suit against Gogo Inc. and its subsidiary Gogo Business Aviation LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Court alleging that Gogo 5G infringes four patents owned by the plaintiff. On February 21, 2023, the plaintiff amended its complaint to allege that Gogo 5G infringes two additional patents recently issued to the plaintiff. The suit seeks compensatory damages as well as treble damages for alleged willful infringement and reimbursement of plaintiff's costs, disbursements and attorneys' fees. On May 29, 2024, Gogo Inc. and its subsidiary Gogo Business Aviation LLC amended its answer and counterclaims in the same suit, alleging that three of the six patents asserted by SmartSky are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent Office. A trial date has been scheduled for April 14, 2025. Claim construction proceedings, fact discovery and expert discovery are completed. Dispositive motions are expected to follow in advance of the trial date. We continue to vigorously defend our position in the infringement suit. The outcome of the underlying litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. On March 5, 2024, Gogo Inc. and its subsidiary Gogo Business Aviation LLC filed counterclaims in the same suit, alleging that SmartSky s ATG network, Flagship equipment, and LITE ATG equipment infringe three patents owned by Gogo. Gogo s counterclaim suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages as well as reimbursement of Gogo's costs and attorneys' fees. On April 10, 2024, the Court held that Gogo's counterclaims would proceed under a separate schedule and would be tried separately from SmartSky's claims. At this time, no schedule has been adopted for Gogo's counterclaims.

 Company Overview 
 Gogo is a leading provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 25 years. Our mission is to enrich the lives of passengers and the efficiency of operators with the world s best business aviation in-flight connectivity and customer support. We have always sought to provide the best connectivity for the business aviation market regardless of technology, and we have a successful history of doing so. Until recently, we focused primarily on business aviation aircraft in North America, which comprise approximately 63 of the worldwide business aviation fleet, and we are the leading provider of in-flight connectivity in that market. Gogo started in analogue air-to-ground ATG technology in the late 1990s, then, as analogue cellular backhaul disappeared, migrated to narrowband satellite connectivity in the early 2000s, then back to ATG with our digital broadband 3G and 4G networks beginning in 2010. We are currently developing our fourth ATG network Gogo 5G that we expect to commercially launch late in the second quarter of 2025. Simultaneous with the development of Gogo 5G, we are actively working with a subset of AVANCE customers and customers utilizing our legacy Gogo Biz ATG airborne system operating on our ground 3G and 4G networks to upgrade to an AVANCE system compatible with a new LTE network. We anticipate this subset of customers will see improved performance because of this network transition, which is expected to occur in early 2026. The cost for the transition to the new LTE network is partially being reimbursed through our participation in the Federal Communications Commission FCC Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (the FCC Reimbursement Program ). 
 We also continue to provide narrowband satellite services to customers in North America and internationally through distribution agreements with satellite providers. In May 2022, in order to further serve our existing customers and expand our target market, we announced plans to expand our broadband offerings beyond ATG by launching the first global broadband service designed for all models of business aircraft Gogo Galileo ). The service will use electronically steered antennas ESAs ), specifically designed to address a broad range of business aviation aircraft, operating on a low earth orbit LEO satellite network. The half duplex HDX antenna is designed to fit on any size business aircraft and is targeted for commercial launch in the fourth quarter of 2024. The full duplex FDX antenna is designed for larger aircraft and is targeted for commercial launch in the second quarter of 2025. We believe that Gogo Galileo, in combination with, or as an alternative to, our ATG systems will allow us to increase our penetration of the North American market and provide an upgrade path for our existing ATG customer base. In addition, we believe that Gogo Galileo will allow us to penetrate the business aviation market outside of North America, where only approximately 6 of business aviation aircraft are installed with in-flight connectivity systems. 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As we do not have multiple segments, we do not present segment information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the business aviation industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: 
 costs associated with the implementation of, and our ability to implement on a timely basis, our technology roadmap, including upgrades to and installation of the ATG technologies we currently offer, Gogo 5G, Gogo Galileo, LTE and any other next generation or other new technology or technology that we acquire; 

25 

our ability to manage issues and related costs that may arise in connection with the implementation of our technology roadmap, including technological issues and related remediation efforts and failures or delays on the part of antenna, chipset, and other equipment developers and providers or satellite network providers, some of which are single-source; 

our ability to license additional spectrum and make other improvements to our network and operations as technology and user expectations change; 

the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidations or changes in fleet size by one or more of our large-fleet customers; 

the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure aviation travel; 

disruptions to supply chains in the aviation industry and installations of our equipment driven by, among other things, labor shortages; 

the extent of our customers adoption of our products and services, which is affected by, among other things, willingness to pay for the services that we provide, the quality and reliability of our products and services, changes in technology and competition from current competitors and new market entrants; 

our ability to engage suppliers of equipment components and network services on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; 

our ability to fully utilize portions of our deferred income tax assets; 

changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services globally, including those affecting our ability to maintain our licenses for ATG spectrum in the United States, obtain sufficient rights to use additional ATG spectrum and/or other sources of broadband connectivity to deliver our services, including Gogo Galileo, expand our service offerings and manage our network; and 

changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting our business or the business of our customers and suppliers globally, including changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment. 

Key Business Metrics 
 Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections.

Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations 
 There have been no material changes to our key components of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A in our 2023 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 
 We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets have the greatest potential impact on and are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates described in the MD A in our 2023 10-K.

2.4 

Total revenue increased to 100.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 97.9 million for the prior-year period, due to an increase in service revenue. Total revenue increased to 306.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 299.8 million for the prior-year period due to an increase in service revenue, partially offset by a decrease in equipment revenue. 
 Service revenue increased to 81.9 million and 245.5 million, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 79.5 million and 237.1 million, respectively, for the prior-year periods, due to increases in ARPU. 
 Equipment revenue increased to 18.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 18.4 million for the prior-year period, due to an increase in the number of ATG units sold, with 214 units sold during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 192 units sold during the prior-year period. Equipment revenue decreased to 61.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 62.7 million for the prior-year period due to a decrease in equipment repair revenue. 
 We expect service revenue to decline in the near term as a result of expected decline in ATG services sold to Intelsat for commercial aviation and increase in the future as additional aircraft come online after the launch of Gogo 5G and Gogo Galileo. We expect equipment revenue to increase in the future driven by growth in sales of ATG units including Gogo 5G, and Gogo Galileo units. 
 Cost of Revenue:

 We expect cost of service revenue to increase over time, due to service revenue growth and increasing network costs, including those for Gogo 5G, Gogo Galileo, and our data center. 
 Cost of equipment revenue increased 23 to 15.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 12.3 million for the prior-year period, due to a 1.6 million increase related to the FCC Reimbursement Program for certain expense reductions in the prior year and 1.2 million due to an increase in ATG units sold. Cost of equipment revenue decreased 1 to 47.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 48.0 million for the prior-year period due to lower inventory reserves. 
 We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will increase with growth in units sold, including Gogo 5G and Gogo Galileo units, following the launch of those products. 
 29 

Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: 
 Engineering, design and development expenses increased 7 and 12 to 9.8 million and 29.3 million, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 9.2 million and 26.3 million, respectively, for the prior-year periods due to personnel costs. 
 We expect engineering, design and development expenses as a percentage of service revenue to increase in 2024, driven by Gogo Galileo development costs and Gogo 5G program spend, and decrease thereafter as these developmental projects are completed and the level of investment decreases and revenue from these product roll-outs increases. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses: 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 22 and 19 to 8.6 million and 25.9 million, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 7.0 million and 21.7 million, respectively, for the prior-year periods due to personnel costs. 
 We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of service revenue to remain relatively flat in the future. 
 General and Administrative Expenses: 
 General and administrative expenses increased 87 and 51 to 24.9 million and 61.4 million, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 13.3 million and 40.7 million, respectively, for the prior-year periods due to increased legal and acquisition-related expenses. 
 We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue to decrease over time. 
 Depreciation and Amortization: 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 14 and 2 to 4.0 million and 11.7 million, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 4.7 million and 12.0 million, respectively, for the prior-year periods. 
 We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future as we launch our Gogo 5G network. 
 Other (Income) Expense: 
 Other expense (income) and percent change for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) :

Total other expense increased to 6.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 5.7 million for the prior-year period, due to interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest income. Total other expense increased to 20.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 20.8 million for the prior-year period, due to the unrealized holding loss on the Investment in Convertible Note in the current-year period as compared with an unrealized holding gain on investment in an equity investment in the prior-year period and increased interest expense, partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt in the prior year and an increase in interest income. 
 We expect our interest expense to fluctuate in the future based on changes in the variable rates associated with the Facilities, partially offset by the impact of the interest rate caps. We expect these fluctuations to be impacted by the decrease in the hedge benefit as our hedge notional amount decreases and the strike rate increases. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 30 

Income Taxes: 
 The effective income tax rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 12.5 and 23.1 , respectively, as compared to 24.3 and (67.1) , respectively, for the prior-year periods. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision was 1.5 million and 12.6 million, respectively, due to pre-tax income. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, our income tax provision was 6.7 million due to pre-tax income and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our income tax benefit of 52.7 million was primarily due to a partial release of the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets, partially offset by pre-tax income. See Note 13, Income Tax, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 We expect our income tax provision to increase in the long term as we continue to generate positive pre-tax income. We expect cash tax payments to be immaterial for an extended period of time, subject to the availability of our net operating loss carryforward amounts. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In our discussion below, we discuss EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as defined below, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measures may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized measurements under GAAP; when analyzing our performance with EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Free Cash Flow, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net income attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results and (iii) use Free Cash Flow in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated net cash provided by operating activities when evaluating our liquidity. 
 Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA represents net income attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) acquisition-related costs, (iii) change in fair value of Investment in Convertible Note and equity investment and (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that management believes have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. 
 We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business and is appropriate given that grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. 
 Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs, such as due diligence and advisory fees. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude acquisition-related costs from Adjusted EBITDA because they are infrequent and do not reflect our operating performance. 
 We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the changes in fair value of Investment in Convertible Note and an equity investment because this activity is not related to our operating performance. 
 We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt from Adjusted EBITDA because of the infrequently occurring nature of this activity. 
 31 

We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our consolidated financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. 
 Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, plus the proceeds received from the FCC Reimbursement Program and the interest rate caps, less purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides meaningful information regarding our liquidity. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company s ongoing business operations and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis of making capital allocation decisions.

Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures 
 Although EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Some of these limitations include: 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income or expense; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for our income taxes; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of capital expenditures needed to maintain our business; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash components of employee compensation; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect unrealized holding gains or losses on equity investments and investments in convertible notes; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on extinguishment of debt; 

Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period; and 

since other companies in our or related industries may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, their usefulness as comparative measures may be limited.

We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, debt and cash from operating activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. Our capital management activities include the assessment of opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets, utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. 
 Liquidity: 
 Based on our current plans, we expect our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the Revolving Facility and capital markets will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our business, including the acquisition of Satcom Direct, capital expenditure requirements, debt maturities and share repurchases, if any, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
 On September 5, 2023, we announced a share repurchase program that grants the Company authority to repurchase up to 50 million of shares of the Company s common stock. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to purchase any shares of our common stock. The timing and total amount of stock repurchases will depend upon business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. We do not expect to incur debt to fund the share repurchase program. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate 3.6 million shares of our common stock for 30.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount available to be repurchased under the program was 14.5 million. 
 As detailed in Note 8, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, on April 30, 2021, GIH entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement with Gogo, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5 , and the Revolving Facility, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. 
 On February 2, 2023, Gogo and GIH entered into an amendment to the Original 2021 Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which replaced all references in the Original 2021 Credit Agreement to LIBOR in respect of the applicable interest rates for the Facilities with an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. 
 The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to 1 of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity on April 30, 2028. There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026. 
 The Term Loan Facility bears annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.75 plus an applicable margin of 3.75 and a credit spread adjustment recommended by the 
 34 

Alternative Reference Rates Committee of 0.11 , 0.26 or 0.43 per annum based on 1-month, 3-month or 6-month term SOFR, respectively or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 . 
 Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.00 plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.25 to 3.75 per annum depending on GIH s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio and a credit spread adjustment recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of 0.11 , 0.26 or 0.43 per annum based on 1-month, 3-month or 6-month term SOFR, respectively or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25 to 2.75 per annum depending on GIH s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. Additionally, unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a fee ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 per annum depending on GIH s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the fee for unused commitments under the Revolving Facility was 0.25 and the applicable margin was 3.25 . 
 The Facilities may be prepaid at GIH s option at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs), subject to minimum principal payment amount requirements. On May 3, 2023, the Company prepaid 100 million of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility. 
 Subject to certain exceptions and de minimis thresholds, the Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to: (i) 100 of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance recovery and condemnation events, subject to reduction to 50 and 0 if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met; (ii) 100 of the net cash proceeds of certain debt offerings; and (iii) 50 of annual excess cash flow (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement), subject to reduction to 25 and 0 if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met. 
 The Revolving Facility includes a financial covenant set at a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio of 7.50:1.00, which will apply if the outstanding amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit drawings thereunder at the end of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35 of the aggregate of all commitments thereunder. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, which, if any of them occurred, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the Facilities to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the Revolving Facility to be terminated. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance the growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of equity, permitted incurrences of debt (by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries), or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. 
 The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem in full and pay the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premiums and to pay fees associated with the termination of the ABL Credit Agreement (together with the redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the Refinancing ), and (ii) to pay the other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing and the Facilities. The Revolving Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes of GIH and its subsidiaries and was undrawn as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 For additional information on the 2021 Credit Agreement, see Note 8, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In May 2021, we purchased interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 650.0 million for 8.6 million. We receive payments in the amount calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the daily compounded SOFR rate plus a credit spread adjustment recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committees of 0.26 increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps with the latest reduction of 175.0 million having occurred on July 31, 2024. The aggregate notional amount of the interest rate caps as of September 30, 2024 is 350.0 million. While the interest rate caps are intended to limit our interest rate exposure under our variable rate indebtedness, which includes the Facilities, if our variable rate indebtedness does not decrease in proportion to the periodic decreases in the notional amount hedged under the interest rate caps, then the portion of such indebtedness that will be effectively hedged against possible increases in interest rates will decrease. In addition, the strike prices periodically increase over the life of the caps. As a result, the extent to which the interest rate caps will limit our interest rate exposure will decrease in the future. 
 For additional information on the interest rate caps, see Note 9, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash flows provided by Operating Activities: 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 

2023 

Net income 

41,959

Changes in operating assets and liabilities 

(6,201) 

(58,141) 

Net cash provided by operating activities

52,818 

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 79.7 million as compared with 52.8 million in the prior-year period. The principal contributors to the year-over-year change in operating cash flows were: 
 A 25.0 million decrease in net income and non-cash charges and credits, as noted above under Results of Operations. 

A 51.9 million improvement in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities resulting from: 

o An increase in cash flows due to the following: 

Changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to the FCC Reimbursement Program; 

Changes in accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments related to personnel costs; 

Changes in accrued interest due to the change in timing of payments; and 

Changes in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. 

o Partially offset by a decrease in cash flows resulting from changes in contract assets due to additional promotional sales programs in the current year as compared to the prior year. 

Cash flows used in Investing Activities: 
 Cash used in investing activities was 3.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to 18.9 million of capital expenditures noted below and a 5.0 million convertible note investment, partially offset by 19.5 million of proceeds from interest rate caps and 1.2 million of proceeds received from the FCC Reimbursement Program associated with the reimbursement of capital expenditures. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 3.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, due to 18.7 million of capital expenditures noted below and a 5.0 million equity investment, partially offset by 20.2 million of proceeds from interest rate caps. 
 Cash flows used in Financing Activities: 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 38.9 million due to share repurchases, principal payments on the Term Loan Facility and stock-based compensation activities. 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was 113.9 million, due to principal payments on the Term Loan Facility and stock-based compensation activities. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our operations require capital expenditures associated with our ATG network, data centers and regulatory licenses. We capitalize software development costs related to network technology solutions. We also capitalize costs related to the build out of our office locations. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 18.9 million and 18.7 million, respectively. 
 We expect that our capital expenditures will increase in the near term due to Gogo 5G and the build out of the LTE network related to the FCC Reimbursement Program. This increase may be partially offset by reimbursements from the FCC. We expect that our capital expenditures will decrease starting in 2026 as these programs are completed. 
 36 

Other 
 Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase hardware components and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the hardware components or as development services are provided. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 14, Leases, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts, U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds with U.S. Government and U.S. Treasury securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while limiting concentration and counterparty risk. 
 The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. 
 Interest Rate Risk: We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness, which includes borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility (if any). We assess our market risks based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings and cash flows based on a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate movements of our variable rate debt and to manage our interest expense. Currently, we receive payments in the amounts calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the daily compounded SOFR rate plus a credit spread adjustment recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of 0.26 increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. Over the life of the interest rate caps, the notional amounts of the caps periodically decrease, while the applicable strike prices increase. 
 The notional amount of outstanding debt associated with interest rate cap agreements as of September 30, 2024 was 350.0 million. Based on our September 30, 2024 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately 2.7 million for the next twelve-month period, which includes the impact of our interest rate caps at a strike rate of 1.25 and the 100 million reduction in the notional amount and an increase of the strike rate to 2.25 that will occur on July 31, 2025. Excluding the impact of our interest rate caps, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately 6.0 million for the next twelve-month period. 
 Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk as a 10 decrease in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by immaterial amounts. 
 Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to lawsuits arising out of the conduct of our business. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of litigation matters. 
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. 

ITEM 1A. 
 Risk Fa ctors 

Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our 2023 10-K. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 10-K. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 As we expand geographically and otherwise, we may experience difficulties in maintaining our corporate culture, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We believe that our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success, and have invested substantial time and resources in building this culture. As we further expand our business and grow internationally, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. For instance, we recently signed an agreement to acquire Satcom Direct s business and, to the extent it is consummated, we will be required to make certain changes to integrate it into our larger business. For more information, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation Acquisition of Satcom Direct, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the pending acquisition. Any failure to manage organizational changes from our expansion, including in our management or employee base, in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture could be detrimental to our future success, including by limiting our ability to recruit and retain personnel and to effectively pursue our corporate objectives. For example, we are dedicated to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive culture and to having every employee feel like they have a home at our company, and our expansion may hinder these efforts. This, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, expansion could lead to our organizational structure becoming more complex, and could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers (both existing customers of the Company and, to the extent the acquisition of Satcom Direct is consummated, new customers acquired as a result of Satcom Direct s business). If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See When we expand our business outside the United States with Gogo Galileo, we will be exposed to a variety of risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business. in our 2023 10-K. 
 We may be unsuccessful at evaluating and pursuing strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, as well as integrating them into our business, which could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Our Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. 
 In addition, to the extent we consummate acquisitions or other related transactions, these completed acquisitions may entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; increased regulatory compliance relating to the acquired business; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses, their personnel and their financial reporting systems, which would prevent the expected benefits from the transaction from being realized within the anticipated timeframe; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and loss of key employees of the acquired businesses or our business. In addition, any future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, or the issuance of additional equity, which could dilute our shareholders interests. 
 39 

Finally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate any acquisition successfully, and once negotiated, receive the required approvals for any acquisition or otherwise conclude any acquisition successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. For more information, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation Acquisition of Satcom Direct, to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our pending acquisition, including the conditions in the Purchase Agreement to consummating the acquisition. We cannot provide any assurance that the pending Satcom Direct acquisition will be completed, and to the extent it is completed, we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully integrate or achieve the anticipated synergies of Satcom Direct s technology, personnel, geographical reach, financial condition or business generally. Additionally, we cannot reasonably predict the impact that Satcom Direct s key operating results or business, or investors perception of its future value, would have on the market s perception of our Company s overall value. There are also risks associated with the incurrence of an additional 275 million of incremental term loans under Intermediate s existing credit facility to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of the acquisition. For more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. in our 2023 10-K. Overall, if our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company s profitability, business and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property 
 We are currently delayed in deploying Gogo 5G, and may be unsuccessful or further delayed in developing and deploying this or other next generation technologies. 
 We are currently developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology, unlicensed spectrum, and licensed spectrum. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrum and supporting different next generation technologies. As previously disclosed, we are delayed in our commercial, nationwide launch of Gogo 5G due to a design error in a non-5G component of our chip, which was designed by a third-party subcontractor of our 5G solution provider. We currently expect the launch of Gogo 5G to occur late in the second quarter of 2025, and are working with our vendors to finalize the schedule. 
 There can be no assurance that, during the current delay of our 5G launch, our customers will not seek alternative technologies of competitors. The launch of 5G may, depending on the impact of delays, launch closely in time or shortly after the launch of Gogo Galileo service, which could impede our marketing and sales efforts with respect to either offering, due to possible customer confusion among the offerings or lack of sufficient customer focus on either one during launch. Additionally, while we expect to launch Gogo 5G late in the second quarter of 2025, we cannot assure you that the 5G launch or our launch of other next generation technologies will in fact occur in sufficient time to meet growing user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience and to effectively compete in the business aviation market. The ongoing delay and any future delays could also decrease customer confidence, including from current or prospective customers, in our offerings, and negatively impact our financial position. 
 If Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology fails to perform as expected, our ability to meet users expectations regarding our systems' performance and to effectively compete in our market may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Factors heightening the risk of future delays in our 5G network or other next generation technologies, or a failure of such technologies to perform once commercialized, include: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers and their ability to continue as a going concern with adequate access to capital for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers.

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity S ecurities and Use of Proceeds 
 a) Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None. 
 b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock 

Not applicable. 
 c) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 

On September 5, 2023, we announced a share repurchase program that grants the Company authority to repurchase up to 50 million of shares of the Company s common stock. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions, including Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to purchase any shares of our common stock. The timing and total amount of stock repurchases will depend upon business, economic and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations.

 ONEWEB DISTRIBUTION PARTNER AGREEMENT 
 This Distribution Partner Agreement (this Agreement is entered into effective as of 19 th May 2022 (the Effective Date by and between Gogo Business Aviation, LLC Distribution Partner ), a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, USA], with its principal place of business at 105 Edgeview Dr, Ste 300, Broomfield, CO 80021 United States, and Network Access Associates Limited OneWeb ), a company incorporated under the laws of England, with its principal place of business at West Works Building , 195 Wood Lane , London , W12 7FQ , United Kingdom .

 Example Plans: 
 [ ] 
 The OneWeb Services fall into the following categories (as described herein): 
 Site Connectivity Access Types; 

Network Slice; and 

Interconnect Service Type. 

A. Site Connectivity Access Types. 

(1) Description of Site Connectivity Access Types : 

i IP Access provides an End User with a single Best Effort (as defined below) quality of service with no/equal traffic prioritization. 

ii Business Access provides the following two (2) levels of priority: (a) high priority connectivity of EF for e.g., Voice Over IP (VOIP) services; and (b) Best Effort connectivity for all other data traffic. 

3 

Certain information identified by [ ] has been excluded from this exhibit because it is both not material and is the type that Gogo Inc. treats as private or confidential. 

 iii IPVPN (a) enables End Users to connect remote business sites easily and cost effectively where multiple business critical applications and services require specific support; and (b) ensures committed quality of service with two (2) levels of priority traffic (as discussed below) in addition to Best Effort connectivity for all other data traffic. 

The following are other key terms with respect to each of the Site Connectivity Access Types: 
 Each Site Connectivity Access Type must be assigned to a Network Slice; and 

Multiple Site Connectivity Access Types may be assigned independently to multiple Network Slices. 

(2) Traffic Prioritization : The OneWeb Network shall support the following three (3) classes of traffic prioritization, which will vary as supported per Site Connectivity Access Type as indicated in the table below:

4. SERVICE LEVELS 

This Section outlines the Service Levels that OneWeb provides for the OneWeb Services purchased through Distribution Partner as further described in Exhibit 1 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding 
 anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, OneWeb s deviation from the Services Levels (and/or other service issues or incidents) shall not constitute a breach or default of this Agreement, and Distribution Partner s sole and exclusive remedy, if any, for such deviation shall be limited to those Service SLA Credits and termination rights for Chronic Performance Problems expressly provided for in this Section below. 
 A. Service SLA and Service Credits. 

Service SLA : Where CIR is defined for a given OneWeb Service plan in Exhibit 1 of this Agreement, OneWeb commits to provide the minimum CIR per CoS as further described below in this Section. 

Service SLA Interval Measurement for each CoS : 

[ ] 
 Service SLA Credit: OneWeb will provide those service credits on the Service SLA as follows (the Service SLA Credit ): [ ] credit on the Site Connectivity MRC for each [ ] degradation when totaling all interval measurements across all applicable CoS intervals, per Specific Site and the Service SLA was not met pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit 2 with any such Service SLA Credit rounded down to the nearest integer; provided that (i) the maximum Service SLA Credit shall not exceed the Service SLA Credit Cap and (ii) the Service SLA Credit shall only apply to the effected and active OneWeb Approved Equipment that is transmitting and/or receiving mobility or fixed service-related data communications through the OneWeb Network at the time of the Service SLA deviation. 

Examples of Service SLA Credit Calculations: The following are illustrative examples of the Service SLA Credit for each Site Connectivity Access Type with a monthly Service SLA Credit Cap of [ ] per month of the applicable Site Connectivity MRC: 

(1) IP Access Example : The following shows an example at a Specific Site of a Site Connectivity Access Type of IP Access with an MIR of [ ]Mbps and a CIR for BE traffic

 B. Network Performance Metrics . OneWeb provides the following OneWeb Network metrics (collectively, the Network Performance Metrics ): 

(1) Link Availability : OneWeb shall maintain a minimum monthly average Link Availability of at least [ ] . Link Availability is the global average percentage of time that a full or half duplex communication link (packets going back and forth) between input to the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment and the OneWeb POP hand-off point is available, which is a product of the system availability and location specific effects. 

(2) Latency : OneWeb shall maintain a Target Average Network Latency of [ ] one-way for the global average of all transmissions as measured and reported by OneWeb between the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment and the OneWeb PoP hand-off point during the measured month. The Forward Link FL one-way latency is measured as the delay between the OneWeb PoP and the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment. The Return Link RL one-way latency is measured as the delay between the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment and the OneWeb PoP. The End-to-End latency for a given Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment is defined as the sum of the FL one-way latency and the RL one-way latency as defined above. 

(3) Packet Error Loss Rate : OneWeb shall maintain a Target Packet/Delivery Loss of successful packet delivery of [ ] as measured and reported by OneWeb between the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment and the OneWeb PoP hand-off point during the measured month. The Packet Error Loss Rate PELR definition shall be based on the definitions in IETF RFC 7680 (or similar). Specifically, it shall measure IP packet loss between the Reference OneWeb Approved Equipment and the OneWeb PoP hand-off point. It shall be measured independently for both the FL and the RL. The PELR metric shall be based on standardized UDP and TCP traffic profiles. The measurement protocol shall follow the applicable definitions/recommendations found in IETF RFC 4656 and IETF RFC 5357 (or similar).

If OneWeb receives a valid claim for Service SLA Credit in accordance with the foregoing process, OneWeb will provide the applicable Service SLA Credit by deducting those Service SLA Credits from amounts due under an invoice within two (2) billing cycles of the final determination date of the claim being validated by OneWeb. Where the Service SLA Credit is due after expiration and/or termination of this Agreement and no further invoices are due to be issued by OneWeb, OneWeb will refund the Service SLA Credit to Distribution Partner in a reasonable period of time. 
 The failure of Distribution Partner to submit a claim for (y) the Service SLA Credit and/or (z) deviation from any of the SLAs in accordance with the foregoing process will constitute a waiver of any remedy that would have otherwise resulted from such claim.

This Exhibit 3 contains the following two (2) parts: Part I , Distribution Partner s general obligations to its Sub-Distributors and End Users; and Part II , providing Distribution Partner (and its Sub-Distributors, as applicable) with the specific flow-down provisions required in all Service Contracts and which apply where Distribution Partner is itself an End User. Unless otherwise specified herein, capitalized terms used in Exhibit 3 will have the meanings attributed to them in this Agreement. 
 
 Part I - General Obligations of Distribution Partner to Sub-Distributors and End Users. 

(a) For all Sub-Distributors and/or End Users, Distribution Partner shall (1) enter into Service Contracts (and/or cause its Sub-Distributors to do the same with respect to End Users and Sub-Distributors as applicable); (2) ensure Sub-Distributor and/or End User abide by the terms and conditions of its applicable Service Contract; and (3) provide only the OneWeb Approved Equipment to be used solely with the OneWeb Service. Additionally, and where Distribution Partner is itself an End User, (A) Part II(b) of this Exhibit 3 shall apply to Distribution Partner and Distribution Partner shall abide by all such terms and conditions contained therein as an End User; and (B) no separate Service Contract shall be required. 

(b) Distribution Partner may use its own template for any Service Contracts so long as each Service Contract meets the following requirements: 

(1)	contains, at a minimum: (A) when a Service Contract is with a Sub-Distributor, or terms that are consistent with and no less restrictive than those required Sub-Distributor flow-down provisions provided below in Part II (a); and (B) when a Service Contract is with an End User, or terms that are consistent with and no less restrictive than those required End User flow-down provisions provided below in Part II (b) (the End User Flow-down Provisions ); and 
 (2)	does not contain any terms or conditions that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, this Exhibit 3). 
 (c) Additionally, and with respect to all Service Contracts, Distribution Partner shall be solely responsible (at its expense) for the following: 

(1)	any acts or omissions by each Sub-Distributor and/or End User in violation of its applicable Service Contract; 
 (2)	performing all obligations set forth in any Service Contract including, without limitation, performing and providing all necessary (A) credit risk / know your customer analysis related thereto, (B) accounting, billing, and collections activities related thereto and (C) support to resolve all technical and non-technical issues in connection with Sub-Distributors distribution of the OneWeb Services and/or End User s access and use of the OneWeb Services; and 
 (3)	enforcing any provisions of a Service Contract against the applicable Sub-Distributor and/or End User when requested to do so by OneWeb. 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, all of Distribution Partner s obligations to OneWeb in this Agreement (including, without limitation, its indemnification and

Prior to Sub-Distributor committing to provide the OneWeb Services to an End User, each End User shall enter into a Service Contract with Sub-Distributor that contains - at a minimum - the End User Flow-down Provisions (with changes made to the language below to account for Sub-Distributor being in privity of contract with End User rather than Distribution Partner) and does not contain any terms or conditions that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, those terms and conditions contained in this Exhibit 3).

 ATTACHMENT 1 TO PART II - OF EXHIBIT 3 ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY 
 (i)	 Fair Access Policy . To ensure that all of OneWeb s partners, customers and End Users have equitable access to the OneWeb Network and to avoid unfair and disruptive use of the OneWeb Network, OneWeb has implemented a Fair Access Policy FAP ), which is a part of the AUP and establishes an equitable balance in accessing and using the capacity of the OneWeb Network. OneWeb has the right to (A) measure and monitor the OneWeb Network for upload and download activity; (B) restrict applications that cause disruption of data transfer rates and poor performance of the OneWeb Service or the OneWeb Network; and (C) use other traffic management, shaping and prioritization at its discretion. OneWeb may reduce data speeds at any time if any of the OneWeb Approved Equipment data usage exceeds an identified threshold with such data usage calculated based on a combination of all inbound and outbound data from the OneWeb Approved Equipment. If any End User or the OneWeb Approved Equipment engages in excessive upload and download data activity and contributes to any disruption of the OneWeb Service or the OneWeb Network, OneWeb is authorized to temporarily restrict the transfer rate at which such OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User can send and receive data over the OneWeb Network without liability. In most cases, the restriction on the OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User transfer rate will last until the end of the then-current data allowance period for the OneWeb Services. If the OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User again engages in excessive upload and download data activity following the restoration of normal transfer rate after commencement of a new data allowance period, OneWeb may further temporarily restrict such transfer rate. Excessive use shall be determined by OneWeb in its sole discretion, based on the limits associated with the OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or the OneWeb Services and pro-rata allocation of network capacity across all of OneWeb s sub-distributors and each of OneWeb s (and its sub-distributor s) end users simultaneously using the OneWeb Network at any point in time. Excessive use includes, without limitation, the use of web cameras, voice or VoIP services, peer to peer file sharing or gaming software applications, streaming media and excessively large file downloads or uploads. Restriction of the transfer rate permitted to a particular OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User as described above will reduce the speed at which such OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User can upload and download data, but will not altogether prevent the use of the OneWeb Service and the OneWeb Network by such OneWeb Approved Equipment and/or End User. 
 (ii)	 Content and Security . End User acknowledges and agrees that (A) access to the Internet and all messages/content through the OneWeb Services and/or the OneWeb Network is done so at End User s sole risk and End User assumes all responsibility, risk and liability for any claims, liability or damages with respect to the OneWeb Services and/or the OneWeb Network (1) for the security, confidentiality and integrity of such messages/content, (2) for the application of security policies designed to prevent unwanted or unauthorized activity or access thereto and/or (3) arising from any use of and/or access to the Internet through its account by any person (even if such use was unauthorized) and, with respect to the foregoing subsections (1)-(3), End User shall take responsibility for the implementation of suitable data archiving or other housekeeping activities which could minimize the effect of any of the foregoing; (B) the reliability, availability, legality, performance and other aspects of resources and content accessed through the Internet are beyond OneWeb s reasonable control and are not in any way warranted, endorsed or supported by OneWeb and accordingly OneWeb is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from sites or resources available through the OneWeb Network and OneWeb Services, including, without limitation, the absence of bugs, errors or viruses, accuracy or reliability of any material or claims contained therein; (C) safeguards related to copyright, ownership, appropriateness, reliability, legality and integrity of content may be unsuitable, insufficient or entirely absent with respect to the Internet and content accessible through it; (D) the Internet is an inherently insecure medium and understands that OneWeb does not represent, warrant, covenant and/or guarantee the security or integrity of any communications made or received using the OneWeb Services or OneWeb Network; and (E) it will ensure that it has the legal authority (based on copyright, trademark, contract, or other body of law) for the

 transmission and duplication of any programming, content, or other materials that it transmits-directly or indirectly - over the OneWeb Service and/or the OneWeb Network. 
 (iii)	 Prohibited Activities . As determined by OneWeb (in its sole discretion), and in addition to the foregoing subsections (i) and (ii) above, End User shall not undertake, or attempt to undertake any use of the OneWeb Network and/or the OneWeb Services in a manner that is (A) inconsistent with the rights of other users of the OneWeb Network and/or this [name of Service Contract]; and/or (B) unethical, unlawful, abusive, excessive, fraudulent or otherwise an unacceptable use, including, without limitation, the following: 
 (1)	posting, disseminating, spamming, storing or transmitting unsolicited messages or unsolicited email (commercial or otherwise); 
 (2)	posting, uploading, disseminating, storing or transmitting material of any kind or nature that, to a reasonable person, may be abusive, obscene, harmful, hateful, pornographic, defamatory, harassing, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another s privacy, grossly offensive, vulgar, threatening, malicious, a nuisance, racially or ethnically offensive or otherwise objectionable; 
 (3)	hacking into, breaching, scanning vulnerability of /or unauthorized access to data, systems or networks; 
 (4)	unauthorized monitoring of data or traffic on any network system; 
 (5)	transmitting viruses and/or interfering or disrupting service to any other user, host or network; 
 (6)	forging of any TCP-IP packet header or any part of the header information in an email or newsgroup posting; 
 (7)	relaying mail via another site s mail server without express permission of that site; 
 (8)	impersonating any person or entity, including any OneWeb employee or representative; 
 (9)	disclosing passwords or other means for accessing the OneWeb Service, operating and provisioning platforms, APIs or OneWeb Network to any third party, or otherwise facilitating unauthorized access thereto; 
 (10)	using the OneWeb Services or the OneWeb Network in any jurisdiction where they are not licensed or authorized; 
 (11)	avoiding fees or charges for the OneWeb Services; 
 (12)	using any VoIP service for forwarding US toll-free numbers internationally; and/or 
 (13)	duplicating, using before or after the valid viewing dates, or otherwise violating the copyright and distribution agreements for content available through the OneWeb Services and/or the OneWeb Network.

At OneWeb s request, Distribution Partner shall provide to OneWeb descriptions of such use and representative samples of Promotional Materials. If OneWeb reasonably determines that such use of the OneWeb Marks and/or the Promotional Materials are of a type or quality that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Guidelines), or is likely to affect the image, reputation, or goodwill associated with the OneWeb Marks, then Distribution Partner shall improve such use of the OneWeb Marks and/or such Promotional Materials to a quality that is consistent with the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Guidelines), and that does not adversely affect the image, reputation, or goodwill associated with the OneWeb Marks, as reasonably determined by OneWeb.
