Evolve limits reproduction of male and female rats beginning with the first breeding cycle following consumption. Evolve is considered a minimum risk pesticide under the EPA Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act FIFRA ), Section 25(b). We must obtain registration from the various state regulatory agencies that do not accept the federal exemption. To date, we are authorized to sell Evolve in states, and major U.S. territories, Puerto Rico and The U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 In May 2024, we launched our latest product Evolve Mouse, a modified version of our soft bait technology containing the active ingredient cottonseed oil. Evolve Mouse limits reproduction of male and female mice after one to two breeding cycles following consumption. Evolve Mouse is also considered a minimum risk pesticide under the EPA s FIFRA, Section 25(b). We must obtain registration from the various state regulatory agencies that do not accept the federal exemption. To date, we are authorized to sell Evolve Mouse in states, with an additional state authorized effective January 1, 2025. 
 Going Concern 
 Our condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue as a going concern. The reports of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 contain a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically, we have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. These prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If we encounter continued issues or delays in the commercialization of fertility control products, our expected future losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and negatively impact our ability to fund continued operations, obtain additional financing in the future and continue as a going concern. There are no assurances that such financing, if necessary, will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through additional financings, sales of our products, licensing fees, royalty payments or from other sources or transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have sustained significant operating losses in the course of our research and development and commercialization activities and expect such losses to continue for the near future. We have generated limited revenue to date from product sales, research grants and licensing fees received under a former license agreement. We have primarily funded our operations to date through the sale of equity securities, including convertible preferred stock, common stock and warrants to purchase common stock.

Table of Contents 

 million and cash and cash equivalents of million. 
 Our ultimate success depends upon the outcome of a combination of factors, including the following: (i) successful commercialization of fertility control products and maintaining and obtaining regulatory approval of our products and product candidates; (ii) market acceptance, commercial viability and profitability of fertility control products and other products; (iii) the ability to market our products and establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure to generate significant revenue; (iv) the success of our research and development; (v) the ability to retain and attract key personnel to develop, operate and grow our business; and (vi) our ability to meet our working capital needs. 
 Based upon our current operating plan, we expect that cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, in combination with anticipated revenue and any additional sales of our equity securities, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next four months. 
 While we have evaluated and continue to evaluate our operating expenses and concentrate our resources toward the successful commercialization of fertility control products in the United States, additional financing will be needed before achieving anticipated revenue targets and margin targets. If we are unable to raise necessary capital through the sale of our securities, we may be required to take other measures that could impair our ability to be successful and operate as a going concern. In any event, additional capital is needed in order to fund our operating losses and research and development activities before we become profitable. We may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise capital through equity or debt financing. If such equity or debt financing is not available at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, limit or terminate commercialization and development efforts or discontinue operations. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On July 23, 2024, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The accompanying financial statements and notes thereto give retrospective effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. All issued and outstanding common stock, options and warrants exercisable for common stock and per share amounts contained in our financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted. 
 The accompanying financial information as of December 31, 2023 is derived from audited financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.

 per share based on the following assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model: 
 Expected volatility Expected dividend yield Expected term (in years) Risk-free interest rate 
 The expected volatility assumption is based on the calculated volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on historical prices over the most recent period commensurate with the term of the award. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expected dividend payouts: we have not, and do not expect to, pay dividends. The expected term assumption is the contractual term of the options for non-employees. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the U.S. treasury yields for bonds with a maturity commensurate with the term of the award.

 In August 2024, we issued shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants. Certain warrant holders were induced to exercise warrants by reducing the exercise price to the then current market price of our common stock (the Warrant Inducement ). The original warrants consisted of shares issued August 24, 2023 with an exercise price of per share and a weighted average remaining life of years (the August 2023 Original Warrants and shares issued November 29, 2023 with an exercise price of per share and a weighted average remaining life of years (the November 2023 Original Warrants (collectively, the Original Warrants ).

 per share for gross proceeds of million, before deducting of issuance costs. Of the shares issued, shares were held in abeyance as of September 30, 2024 and not considered outstanding until certain conditions are met, at which time such shares will become outstanding. The balance of the shares in abeyance will be held in abeyance until notice from the stockholder that the balance, or portion thereof, may be issued in compliance with a beneficial ownership limitation provision in the warrants. Such shares were released from abeyance in October. 
 In connection with the Warrant Inducement transaction, new warrants to purchase shares of our common stock were issued, which are discussed in Note 7. 
 In June 2024, we entered into an at-the-market offering arrangement with a sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to ATM Facility ). The offer and sale of shares will be made pursuant to a previously filed shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration no. 333-261227), originally filed with the SEC on November 19, 2021 and amended on May 4, 2022, and declared effective by the SEC on May 6, 2022, and the related prospectus supplement related to the offering of shares dated June 20, 2024, and filed with the SEC on such date pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.

 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and related notes.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained or incorporated herein by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future operating results, future financial position, business strategy, objectives, goals, plans, prospects, markets, and plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, suggests, targets, contemplates, projects, predicts, may, might, plan, would, should, could, can, potential, continue, objective, or the negative of those terms, or similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Specific forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements regarding: 
 our belief that Evolve and Evolve Mouse are considered a minimum risk pesticides under the United States Environmental Protection Agency s (the EPA s Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act FIFRA ), Section 25(b); 
 our expectation that we will continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future;

 our ability to achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows; 
 our expectation that we will incur substantial and increased expenses; 
 our belief that if we encounter continued issues or delays in the commercialization of fertility control products, our expected future losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and negatively impact our ability to fund continued operations, obtain additional financing in the future and continue as a going concern;

 our ability to explore into strategic partnerships to enable us to penetrate additional target markets and geographical locations; 
 our ability to manage the infrastructure for sales, marketing and distribution of fertility control products and any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;

Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or expressed in such statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Item 1A- Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.

 the successful commercialization of our products; 
 market acceptance of our products; 
 our financial performance, including our ability to fund operations; 
 our ability to maintain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements;

 other factors and risks identified from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Overview 
 Since our inception, we have sustained significant operating losses in the course of our research and development and commercialization activities and expect such losses to continue for the near future. Although sales of our product have increased over the last three years, 17 in 2023, 77 in 2022 and 123 in 2021, we are not yet able to fund operations by product sales alone. We have primarily funded our operations to date through the sale of equity securities, including convertible preferred stock, common stock and warrants to purchase common stock. We have also generated limited revenue from research grants and licensing fees received under former license agreements. 
 Through September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 103.8 million from our sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrant exercises and issuance of convertible and other promissory notes, an aggregate of 1.7 million from licensing fees and an aggregate of 5.0 million in net product sales. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 134.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of 2.5 million. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses every year since our inception, with a net loss of 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and generate operating losses for at least the next six months. 
 Our ultimate success depends upon the outcome of a combination of factors, including the following: (i) successful commercialization of fertility control products and maintaining and obtaining regulatory approval of our products and product candidates; (ii) market acceptance, commercial viability and profitability of fertility control products and other products; (iii) the ability to market our products and establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure to generate significant revenue; (iv) the success of our research and development; (v) the ability to retain and attract key personnel to develop, operate and grow our business; and (vi) our ability to meet our working capital needs. 
 Based upon our current operating plan, we expect that cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, in combination with anticipated revenue and any additional sales of our equity securities, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next four months. 
 While we have evaluated and continue to evaluate our operating expenses and concentrate our resources toward the successful commercialization of fertility control products in the United States and internationally, additional financing will be needed before achieving anticipated revenue targets and margin targets. If we are unable to raise necessary capital through the sale of our securities, we may be required to take other measures that could impair our ability to be successful and operate as a going concern. In any event, additional capital is needed in order to fund our operating losses and research and development activities before we become profitable. We may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise capital through equity or debt financing. If such equity or debt financing is not available at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, limit or terminate commercialization and development efforts or discontinue operations.

 Revenues 
 Sales, net of sales discounts and promotions, were 482,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 360,000 for the third quarter of 2023. The 122,000 increase was driven by the launch of our latest Evolve product offerings, partially offset by a decrease in the number of units sold of our existing ContraPest product offerings. Launched in January 2024, and expanded during 2024 with variations in product offerings, Evolve is a soft bait containing the active ingredient cottonseed oil and represented approximately 68 , or 330,000, of revenues for the third quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this increase, was a decline in revenue related to our ContraPest product offerings in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. Limited erosion of demand for ContraPest products is expected as Evolve products are accepted in the marketplace. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales were 1,356,000, compared to 898,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 458,000 increase was driven by our latest Evolve product offerings through 2024, which represented approximately 63 , or 849,000, of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was offset by a decrease related to a lower number of units sold of our existing ContraPest product offering the Elevate Bait System in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales consists of costs related to products sold, including scrap and reserves for obsolescence, as well as shipping costs when charged to the customer. Cost of sales was 167,000, or 34.6 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 184,000, or 51.2 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2023. The lower cost of net sales is largely due to a shift in the mix of products sold, and declined largely driven by our latest product offering, Evolve, which launched in January 2024. Shipping costs, which impacts gross profit margin, was 13 and 12 of cost of sales in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales was 657,000, or 48.5 of net sales, compared to 488,000, or 54.4 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales in 2024 was impacted during the first few months of 2024 from the higher cost of a key ingredient for our new Evolve product as we transitioned from development-stage raw materials pricing to production-level raw materials pricing. Cost of sales in 2023 was impacted by the scrapping of defective trays no longer used in our products in the first quarter of 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 315,000, for a gross profit margin of 65.4 , compared to a gross profit of 176,000, or a gross profit margin of 48.8 , for the third quarter of 2023. Higher gross profit margin was driven by a shift 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 in the mix of products sold, and increased due to our latest product offering Evolve, which launched in January 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower gross profit margin related to a shift in the mix of sales through our sales channels, with higher sales to distributors in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 699,000, for a gross profit margin of 51.5 , compared to 410,000, gross profit margin of 45.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin in 2024 was impacted by both the higher-than-expected cost of a key ingredient in our new Evolve product during the first quarter, combined with an increased proportion of our sales coming from distributors, who are offered a lower price due to the quantities purchased. The gross profit margin in 2023 was impacted by the higher cost of sales related to the scrapping of defective tanks no longer used in our products. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Personnel (including stock-based compensation) 282 231 51 810 687 123 Facility-related 47 28 19 124 79 45 Depreciation 34 28 6 94 84 10 Supplies and maintenance 12 34 (22) 72 81 (9) Professional fees 32 34 (2) 66 112 (46) Stability studies, materials and testing 33 1 32 67 55 12 Other 11 23 (12) 55 49 6 Total 451 379 72 1,288 1,147 141 
 Research and development expenses were 451,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 379,000 for the third quarter of 2023. The 72,000 increase was primarily due to the realignment of the focus of our field development personnel to research and development activities, lower overhead allocation, and increased costs related to the expansion of facilities and supplies and maintenance related to research and development efforts. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting and legal fees required for research and development purposes, combined with lower expenses overall related to field and product improvement studies in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were 1,288,000, compared to 1,147,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 141,000 increase was primarily due to the realignment of the focus of our field development personnel to research and development activities, lower overhead allocation, and increased costs related to the expansion of facilities and supplies and maintenance related to research and development efforts. These increases were partially offset by lower consulting and legal fees required for research and development purposes, combined with lower expenses overall related to field and product improvement studies in 2024 when compared with 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 1.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease of 337,000 was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses resulting from both lower headcount and stock-based compensation, combined with lower professional fees and insurance costs. Consulting fees related to marketing efforts are lower in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023 due to changes in our overall marketing program, combined with lower legal fees. Additionally, our insurance cost is lower resulting from both policy and rate changes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were 4.4 million, compared to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 856,000 decrease was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses resulting from both lower headcount and stock-based compensation, combined with lower professional fees and insurance costs. Consulting fees related to marketing efforts are lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to changes in our overall marketing program, combined with lower legal fees. Additionally, our insurance cost is lower resulting from both policy and rate changes. In the second quarter of 2023, personnel costs includes severance costs of 119,000 related to the termination of our former Chief Revenue Officer. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net for the third quarter of 2024 consisted of miscellaneous income of 29,000 and interest income of 11,000, partially offset by interest expense of 6,000. Other income consisted of interest income of 4,000 for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we realized a gain of 28,000 on the sale of equipment, which is included in miscellaneous income. Interest income was higher due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by declining interest rates during the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 relates to the notes payable entered into beginning in late 2023 for the purchase of certain equipment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income, net, consisted of interest income of 48,000 and miscellaneous income of 30,000, partially offset by interest expense of 15,000, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of interest income of 19,000. The higher interest income was due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by declining interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, miscellaneous income largely consisted of a gain realized on the sale of equipment, while interest expense relates to the notes payable entered into beginning in late 2023 for purchases of certain equipment.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have sustained significant operating losses in the course of our research and development activities and commercialization efforts and expect such losses to continue for the near future. We have generated limited revenue to date from product sales, research grants and licensing fees received under a former license. We have primarily funded our operations to date through the sale of equity securities, including convertible preferred stock, common stock and warrants to purchase common stock, and debt financing, consisting primarily of convertible notes. 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have received net proceeds of 103.8 million from our sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrant exercises and issuance of convertible and other promissory notes, an aggregate of 5.0 million in net product sales and an aggregate of 1.7 million from licensing fees. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 134.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of 2.5 million. 
 Our ultimate success depends upon the outcome of a combination of factors, including the following: (i) successful commercialization of our fertility control products and maintaining and obtaining regulatory approval of our products and product candidates; (ii) market acceptance, commercial viability and profitability of our fertility control products and any other products; (iii) the ability to market our products and establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure to generate significant revenue; (iv) the success of our research and development activities; (v) the ability to retain and attract key personnel to develop, operate and grow our business; and (vi) our ability to meet our working capital needs. 
 Based upon our current operating plan, we expect that cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, in combination with anticipated revenue and any additional sales of our equity securities, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next four months. We have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our operating expenses and will concentrate our resources toward the successful commercialization of our fertility control products in the United States and internationally. However, if anticipated revenue targets and margin targets are not achieved or expenses are more than we have budgeted, we may need to raise additional financing before that time. If we need more financing, including within the next six months, and we are unable to raise the necessary capital through the sale of our securities, we may be required to take other measures that could impair our ability to be successful and operate as a going concern. In any event, we may require additional capital in order to fund our operating losses and research and development activities before we become profitable and may opportunistically raise capital. We may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise capital through equity or debt financing. If such equity or debt financing is not available at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, limit or terminate commercialization and development efforts or discontinue operations. 
 Additional Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to continue or increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we focus on marketing and sales of fertility control products. In addition, we will continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 In particular, we expect to incur substantial and increased expenses as we: 
 work to maximize market acceptance for, and generate sales of, our products, including by conducting field demonstrations for potential lead customers; 
 explore strategic partnerships to enable us to penetrate additional target markets and geographical locations; 
 manage the infrastructure for sales, marketing and distribution of fertility control products and any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; 
 seek additional regulatory approvals for fertility control products, including to more fully expand the market and use for fertility control products and, if we believe there is commercial viability, for our other product candidates; 
 further develop our manufacturing processes to contain costs while being able to scale to meet future demand of fertility control products and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 continue product development of fertility control products and advance our research and development activities and, as our operating budget permits, advance the research and development programs for other product candidates; 
 maintain and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 
 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company. 
 We will need additional financing to fund these continuing and additional expenses. 
 Capital Resources

Our net loss was driven by costs related to our selling, general and administrative activities resulting from our continued efforts to commercialize our products, combined with research and development costs related to our continued efforts on formulations of new products and improvements to existing products. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of increases in accounts receivable of 121,000, inventory of 85,000, prepaid expenses of 28,000, and deposits of 41,000, combined with a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 4,000.
