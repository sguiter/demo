 Liquidity, Going Concern and Management's Plans 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of obligations in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were , compared to at December 31, 2023, a decrease of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we used in cash from operations and had a net operating loss of , due to a decrease in Products revenue and gross margin and an increase in operating expenses. Our Service gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of is below our historical Service gross margins which ranged between to . Working capital at September 30, 2024 was , compared to at December 31, 2023, a decrease of and our accumulated deficit was . 
 
 As a result of the above factors, management has performed an analysis to evaluate our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the financial statements issuance date. Management s analysis includes forecasting future revenues, expenditures and cash flows, taking into consideration past performance as well as key initiatives recently undertaken. Our forecasts are dependent on our ability to maintain margins based on the our ability to close on new and expanded business, leverage existing working capital, and effectively manage expenses. New and expanded business includes the sale and shipment of newly developed hybrid-drive air-cooled chillers, the acquisition of additional maintenance contracts in February 2024 and May 2024 (see Note 7. "Aegis Contract and Related Asset Acquisitions"), and the expansion of markets served by our chiller products into the data center market, which is currently experiencing power constraints. Our backlog at September 30, 2024 was . We have drawn under the note subscription agreements with related parties (see Note 11. "Related Party Notes"). On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized management to proceed with an equity offering consisting of a private placement to existing shareholders in an amount of up to million, consisting of share of common stock, with a warrant to purchase share of common stock for each share purchased, exercisable within . Based on management's analysis, we believe that cash flows from operations, the note agreements and anticipated proceeds from the private placement offering will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. There can, however, be no assurance we will be able to do so. Based on our analysis, the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern. If we do not achieve our revenue, expenditure or cash flows forecast, we may need to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing to meet our need for capital to fund operations and future growth.

interest. As the controlling partner, all major decisions in respect of ADGNY are made by ADGE in accordance with the joint venture agreement. The interests in the individual underlying energy system projects in ADGNY vary between ADGE and its joint venture partner. The noncontrolling interest and distributions are determined based on economic ownership. The economic ownership is calculated by the amount invested by us and the noncontrolling partner in each site. Each quarter, we calculate a year-to-date profit/loss for each site that is part of ADGNY and the noncontrolling interest percent of economic ownership in each site is applied to determine the noncontrolling interest share in the profit/loss. The same methodology is used to determine quarterly distributions of available cash to the noncontrolling interest partner. On our balance sheet, noncontrolling interest represents the joint venture partner s investment in ADGNY, plus its share of after-tax profits less any cash distributions. ADGE owned a controlling legal and economic interest in ADGNY as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are also unaudited. The operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the present year presentations. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 
 For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Tecogen's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure s. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The new standard requires enhanced disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments including more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. The amendments in this update apply to all public entities that are required to report segment information, and include those entities that have a single reportable segment. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure s. In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . ASU 2023-09 provides more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

days. We recognize revenue in certain circumstances before delivery to the customer has occurred (commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions). We recognize revenue related to such transactions once, among other things, the customer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the product(s) under normal billing and credit terms, the customer has requested the product(s) be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them, risk of ownership has been assumed by the customer, and the product(s) are tagged as sold and segregated for storage awaiting further direction from the customer. Due to the infrequent nature and duration of bill and hold arrangements, the value associated with custodial storage services is deemed immaterial in the context of the contract and in total , and , accordingly, none of the transaction price is allocated to such service. 
 Depending on the product and terms of the arrangement, we may defer the recognition of a portion of the transaction price received because we have to satisfy a future obligation (e.g., product start-up service). Amounts allocated to product start-up services are recognized as revenue when the start-up service has been completed. We use an observable selling price to determine standalone selling prices where available and either a combination of an adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a margin approach, and/or a residual approach to determine the standalone selling prices for separate performance obligations as a basis for allocating contract consideration when an observable selling price is not available. Amounts received but not recognized pending completion of performance are recognized as contract liabilities and are recorded as deferred revenue along with deposits by customers. 
 Services Segment 
 Maintenance Services. Maintenance services are provided under either long-term maintenance contracts or time and material maintenance contracts. Revenue under time and material maintenance contracts is recognized when the maintenance service is completed. Revenue under long-term maintenance contracts is recognized either ratably over the term of the contract where the contract price is fixed or when the periodic maintenance activities are completed and the invoiced cost to the customer is based on run hours or kilowatts produced in a given period. We use an output method to measure progress towards completion of our performance obligation which results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the services transferred to date relative to the remaining services promised under the contract. We use the practical expedient at ASC 606-10-55-18 of recognizing revenue in an amount equal to the amount we have the right to invoice the customer under the contract. Revenues resulting from the Aegis acquisition (see Note 7. Aegis Contract and Related Asset Acquisitions) have been included in our revenue from the Services segment since April 1, 2023. Payment terms for maintenance services are generally days. 
 Energy Production Segment 
 Energy Production. Revenue from energy contracts is recognized when electricity, heat, hot and/or chilled water is produced by our owned on-site cogeneration systems. Each month we bill the customer and recognize revenue for the various forms of energy delivered, based on meter readings which capture the quantity of the various forms of energy delivered in a given month under a contractually defined formula which takes into account the current month's cost of energy from the local power utility. 
 As the various forms of energy delivered by us under energy production contracts are simultaneously delivered and consumed by the customer, our performance obligation under these contracts is considered to be satisfied over time. We use an output method to measure progress towards completion of our performance obligation which results in the recognition of revenue on the basis of a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the services transferred to date relative to the remaining services promised under the contract. We use the practical expedient at ASC 606-10-55-18 of recognizing revenue in an amount equal to that amount to which we have the right to invoice the customer under the contract. Payment terms on invoices under these contracts are generally days.

. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations related to ASC 606 represent the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations with an original contract term of greater than one year, excluding certain maintenance contracts and all energy production contracts where a direct measurement of the value to the customer is used as a method of measuring progress towards completion of our performance obligation. Exclusion of these remaining performance obligations is due in part to the inability to quantify values based on unknown future levels of delivery and in some cases rates used to invoice customers. Remaining performance obligations therefore consist of unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations related to fixed price maintenance contracts and installation contracts. 
 . We expect to recognize revenue of approximately of the remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, recognized in the first 12 months and recognized over the subsequent 12 months and the balance thereafter.

cogeneration systems and we agreed to acquire from Aegis certain vehicles and inventory used by Aegis in connection with the performance of its maintenance services. At closing, we acquired eight ) Aegis vehicles for consideration consisting of in cash. Also, we issued credits against outstanding accounts receivable due from Aegis in the amount of for the acquisition of inventory that Aegis used to provide maintenance services. At closing, we hired eight ) Aegis employees who, following the closing, have agreed to continue to provide maintenance services relating to the cogeneration systems covered by the maintenance agreements assumed pursuant to the Agreement. Following the closing and for a period of up to seven ) years, we agreed to pay Aegis a percentage of the revenue collected for maintenance services provided pursuant to the maintenance agreements acquired from Aegis. The Agreement contained certain indemnification provisions and agreements on the part of Aegis and for each party to cooperate with each other and provide certain transitional assistance. We acquired the Aegis maintenance agreements to expand our Service portfolio and to benefit from the long-term contract revenue stream generated by these agreements. 
 On February 1, 2024, Tecogen and Aegis amended the Agreement to add eighteen ) additional maintenance contracts assumed by us (the "February 2024 Amendment") which includes an undertaking by Aegis to use commercially reasonable efforts to support and assist our execution of maintenance service agreements for an additional thirty-six ) cogeneration units sold to customers by Aegis. No additional maintenance service agreements contemplated in the February 2024 Amendment have been executed as of September 30, 2024. 
 On May 1, 2024, Tecogen and Aegis amended the Agreement to add thirty-one ) additional maintenance contracts assumed by us (the "May 2024 Amendment") which includes an undertaking by Aegis to use commercially reasonable efforts to support and assist our execution of maintenance service agreements for an additional forty-eight ) cogeneration units sold to customers by Aegis. No additional maintenance service agreements contemplated in the May 2024 Amendment have been executed as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have determined that the assignment and assumption of the Aegis maintenance agreements, in combination with the related asset acquisition and the retention of the former Aegis employees, constitutes a business and should be accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method. As of the acquisition date, we recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, at fair value. We have applied an interpretation of the guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations, that allows an entity to combine multiple acquisitions as one single transaction due to the April 1, 2023, February 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024 acquisitions being executed in contemplation of one another to achieve the same commercial objective for the Company. As a result, we have adjusted the initial accounting for the April 1, 2023 acquisition for the value of net assets acquired from the February 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024 acquisitions.

 Initial Acquisition - April 1, 2023 
 The amounts initially recognized for inventory, identifiable intangible assets, contingent consideration and deferred maintenance reserves were provisional pending completion of the necessary valuations and analysis. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide companies with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2023, we have completed our analysis and valuation. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we recorded no adjustments to the fair value of the contingent consideration and deferred maintenance reserves given the probability of achieving the revenue estimates and the actual and expected maintenance costs were consistent with our initial valuation. 
 February 2024 Amendment 
 The amounts initially recognized for identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration are provisional, pending completion of the necessary valuations and analysis. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide companies with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date.

, profitability assumptions, revenue assumptions, and anticipated existing contract run out were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate fair value. The discount rate reflects an estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital. 
 Following the closing and for a period of up to seven ) years, we agreed to pay Aegis contingent consideration equal to a percentage of the revenue collected for maintenance services provided pursuant to the maintenance agreements acquired from Aegis. On the date of acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration and the deferred maintenance reserve were calculated under the income approach using a weighted average cost of capital of , discounting the future cash flows to present value, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the fair value contingencies are resolved. Fair value adjustments which may be determined at subsequent reporting dates will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and will not impact the goodwill balance after the measurement period. 
 The contingent consideration is payable within forty-five ) days following the end of each calendar quarter through the earlier of the expiration or termination of the relevant maintenance agreements, or the seventh (7th) anniversary of the acquisition date. The consideration is equal to the product of the revenues collected in a calendar quarter multiplied by an applicable percentage. The agreement stipulates quarterly aggregate revenue targets and an applicable percentage, and provides for a higher applicable percentage if revenues exceed the target revenues. The applicable percentage ranges from to over the agreement term. The deferred maintenance reserve represents costs, which are expected to be incurred over a period from the date of acquisition to repair customer equipment which had not been sufficiently maintained prior to our acquisition of the maintenance service agreements. 
 The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognized at their fair value based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement," as of the acquisition date. The process for estimating fair value requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the net identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the going concern element of the Aegis business, including its assembled workforce and the long-term nature of the customer maintenance agreements, as well as anticipated cost synergies due primarily to the elimination of administrative overhead. Goodwill resulting from the Aegis acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
 Acquisition-related costs which consisted on recurring internal resources were de minimus and such costs were expensed as incurred (ASC 805-50-30-1).

 Assumption of Aegis Energy Services Maintenance Agreements 
 On March 15, 2023, we entered into an agreement ("Agreement") with Aegis Energy Services, LLC Aegis pursuant to which Aegis agreed to assign to us and we agreed to assume certain Aegis maintenance agreements, we agreed to purchase certain assets, and related matters Acquisition ). On April 1, 2023, the Acquisition closed. Under the Agreement, we agreed to acquire from Aegis and assume Aegis' rights and obligations arising on or after April 1, 2023 under maintenance agreements pursuant to which Aegis provided maintenance services for approximately 200 cogeneration systems, and acquired certain vehicles and inventory used by Aegis in connection with the performance of such maintenance services, and, following closing hired eight (8) Aegis employees to provide services with respect to such maintenance agreements. At closing, we acquired eight (8) Aegis vehicles for consideration consisting of 170,000 in cash. Also, we issued credits against outstanding accounts receivable due from Aegis in the amount of 300,000 for the acquisition of inventory that Aegis used to provide maintenance services. 
 On February 1, 2024, Tecogen and Aegis amended the Agreement to add eighteen (18) additional maintenance service agreements (the "Amendment"). The Amendment includes an undertaking by Aegis to use commercially reasonable efforts to support and assist our execution of maintenance service agreements for an additional thirty-six (36) cogeneration units sold to customers by Aegis. 
 On May 1, 2024, Tecogen and Aegis amended the Agreement to add thirty-one (31) additional maintenance contracts (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment includes an undertaking by Aegis to use commercially reasonable efforts to support and assist our execution of maintenance service agreements for an additional forty-eight (48) cogeneration units sold to customers by Aegis.

 Factory Move 
 In April, 2024, Tecogen moved its manufacturing operations and corporate offices from 45 First Ave, Waltham, MA to 76 Treble Cove Road, Building 1, North Billerica, MA. As a result of the move, product revenues were impacted during the second and third quarters of 2024. The factory move also necessitated construction activities to install equipment test cells and comply with local regulations. We resumed manufacturing operations during the later-half of the third quarter of 2024.

 Impact of Anti-fossil Fuel Sentiment 
 In some key markets such as New York City, the regulatory push to eliminate fossil fuels from buildings has impacted cogeneration unit sales. The Company believes that as regulations take into account scope 2 emissions, products like our hybrid chiller that can choose the cleanest fuel source will have a significant advantage in decarbonization efforts. 
 Impact of Utility Power Constraints and Data Center Construction 
 As more load is added to the utility grid in the form of data centers, EV charging, and other demands for power, customers are facing power constraints. Tecogen believes that these power constrained customers, in particular data centers and industrial facilities represent a significant opportunity for growth. The customer need is driven by ability to expand an existing facility or open a new facility quickly while taking advantage of utility expense savings long term. Our chiller products can reduce the electrical capacity needed on-site by 30 or more. Our InVerde product can provide on-site power generation which allows customers to eliminate long lead times associated with electrical switch gear and bridge any short fall in power from the utility. 
 Residual Impacts of Covid 
 Supply chains were adversely impacted during Covid, resulting in significant delays or lack of availability of critical components such as engines. This has continued to have long term impact on product and service margin. The direct impact has been certain costs increasing faster than inflation. The indirect impact is from increased engine related costs in the service segment as replacements were deferred or overhauled components were used due to lack of parts. We have instituted a service price increase and have also been making engineering improvements to increase service intervals to increase gross margins. 
 Tecochill Hybrid-Drive Air-Cooled Chiller Development 
 During the third quarter of 2021 we began development of the Tecochill Hybrid-Drive Air-Cooled Chiller. We recognized that there were many applications where the customer wanted an easy to install roof top chiller. Using the inverter design from our InVerde e+ cogeneration module, the system can simultaneously take two inputs, one from the grid or a renewable energy source and one from our natural gas engine. This allows a customer to seek the optimum blend of operational cost savings and greenhouse gas benefits while providing added resiliency from two power sources. We introduced the Tecochill Hybrid-Drive Air-Cooled Chiller at the AHR Expo in February 2023 and received an order on February 8, 2024 for three hybrid-drive air-cooled chillers for a utility company in Florida. A patent application based on this concept was issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office in March 2024. 
 Controlled Environment Agriculture 
 On July 20, 2022, we announced our intention to focus on opportunities for the use of our cogeneration equipment in low carbon Controlled Environment Agriculture ("CEA"). We believe that CEA offers an exciting opportunity to apply our expertise in clean cooling, power generation, and greenhouse gas reduction to address critical issues affecting food and energy security. 
 CEA facilities enable multiple crop cycles (15 to 20 cycles) in one year compared to one or two crop cycles in conventional farming. In addition, growing produce close to the point of sale reduces food spoilage during transportation. Food crops grown in greenhouses typically have lower yields per square foot than in CEA facilities, and the push to situate facilities close to consumers in cities requires minimizing land area and maximizing yield per square foot. Yields are increased in CEA facilities by supplementing or replacing natural light with grow lights in a climate-controlled environment - which requires significant energy use. 
 In recent years our cogeneration equipment has been used in numerous cannabis cultivation facilities because our systems reduce the facility's need for power, significantly reduce operating costs and the facility GHG footprint, and offer resiliency to grid outages. Our experience providing clean energy solutions to cannabis cultivation facilities has given us significant insight into requirements relating to energy-intensive indoor agriculture applications that we expect to be transferable to CEA facilities for food production. 
 Related Party Notes 
 On October 9, 2023, we entered into note subscription agreements with each of John N. Hatsopoulos, a director and principal shareholder of Tecogen, and Earl R. Lewis, III, a director of Tecogen, pursuant to which Mr. Hatsopoulos agreed to provide financing to us of up to 1 million, and Mr. Lewis agreed to provide financing to us of 500,000, and potentially, an additional 500,000 at his discretion. On October 10, 2023, we issued a promissory note and borrowed 500,000 from Mr. Hatsopoulos, which matures on October 10, 2025. The loan bears interest at 5.12 per annum. On July 23, 2024, we borrowed an additional 500,000 from Mr. Hatsopoulos, and executed a promissory note with a maturity of one year and interest at 5.06 per annum. On September 18, 2024, we issued a promissory note and borrowed 500,000 from Mr. Lewis. The loan matures on September 18, 2025 and bears interest at 4.57 per annum. See Note 11."Related Party Notes" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Impact of the Geopolitical Tensions 
 We have no operations or customers in Russia, the Ukraine or in the Middle East. The higher energy prices for natural gas as a result of the war may affect the performance of our Energy Production Segment and the cost differential between grid generated energy and natural gas sourced energy using our cogeneration equipment. However, we have also seen higher electricity prices as much of the electricity production in the United States is generated from fossil fuels. If the electricity prices continue to rise, the economic savings generated by our products are likely to increase. In addition to the direct result of changes in natural gas and electricity prices, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East may result in higher cybersecurity risks, increased or ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatility related to the trading prices of commodities. 
 Overview 
 Tecogen designs, manufactures, markets, and maintains high efficiency, ultra-clean cogeneration products. These include natural gas engine driven combined heat and power (CHP) systems, chillers and heat pumps for multi-family residential, commercial, recreational and industrial use. We are known for products that provide customers with substantial energy savings, resiliency from utility power outages and for significantly reducing a customer s carbon footprint. Our products are sold with our patented Ultera technology which nearly eliminates all criteria pollutants such as NOx and CO. Our systems are greater than 88 efficient compared to typical electrical grid efficiencies of 40 to 50 . As a result, our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per KwH are typically half that of the electrical grid. Our systems generate electricity and hot water or in the case of our Tecochill product, both chilled water and hot water. These result in savings of energy related costs of up to 60 for our customers. Our products are expected to run on Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) as it is introduced into the US gas pipeline infrastructure. 
 Our products are sold directly to end-users by our in-house sales team and by established sales agents and representatives. We have agreements in place with distributors and sales representatives. Our existing customers include hospitals and nursing homes, colleges and universities, health clubs and spas, hotels and motels, office and retail buildings, food and beverage processors, multi-unit residential buildings, laundries, ice rinks, swimming pools, factories, municipal buildings, military installations and indoor growing facilities. To date we have shipped over 3,200 units, some of which have been operating for almost 35 years. 
 With the acquisition of American DG Energy Inc. ("ADGE") in May 2017, we added an additional source of revenue. Through ADGE, we install, own, operate and maintain complete distributed generation electricity systems and other complementary systems at customer sites, and sell electricity, hot water, heat and cooling energy under long-term contracts at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates. Each month we obtain readings from our energy meters to determine the amount of energy produced for each customer. We use a contractually defined formula to multiply these readings by the appropriate published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from each customer's local energy utility, to derive the value of our monthly energy sale, which includes a negotiated discount. Our revenues per customer on a monthly basis vary based on the amount of energy produced by our energy systems and the published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from our customer's local energy utility that month. 
 Our operations are comprised of three business segments. Our Products segment designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems. Our Services segment provides O M services for our products under long term service contracts. Our Energy Production segment sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements.

The decrease in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due in part to the relocation of our manufacturing operations to our new facility in April 2024, which significantly reduced our production capacity and caused certain customer order delays, resulting in a decrease in chiller sales of 1,897,186 and a 46,348 decrease in engineered accessory sales, offset partially by a 395,761 increase in cogeneration sales. Our Products sales mix, as well as product revenue, can vary significantly from period to period as our products are high dollar, low volume sales. 
 Services 
 Service revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,850,551, compared to 3,842,600 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 7,951, or 0.2 . The increase in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to an increase in existing service contract revenues of 73,322, or 2.3 , offset partially by a 65,371, or 10.8 , decrease in revenue from the acquired Aegis maintenance contracts. Overall service contract revenues were impacted due to maintenance delays which caused certain sites to cease operating the serviced equipment. 
 Our service operation revenues grow with the sale of installed systems because the majority of our product sales are accompanied by a service contract or time and materials agreements, and by the acquisition of maintenance contracts. As a result, our fleet of units being serviced by our service department grows with product sales. 
 Energy Production 
 Energy Production revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 388,563, compared to 331,141 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 57,422, or 17.3 . The increase in Energy Production revenue is due to increased run hours at certain energy production sites. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,149,216 compared to 4,186,509 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1,037,293, or 24.8 . The decrease in cost of sales is due to decreased Product sales and lower service contract maintenance costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 our gross margin increased to 44.1 compared to 41.1 for the same period in 2023, a 3.0 increase due to higher service contract margins. 
 Products 
 Cost of sales for Products in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 797,209 compared to 1,669,747 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 872,538, or 52.3 due to decreased sales of Products. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Products gross margin was 42.7 compared to 43.2 for the same period in 2023, a 0.5 decrease. The decrease in margin was a function of unabsorbed labor costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Services 
 Cost of sales for Services in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,139,042 compared to 2,346,384 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 207,342, or 8.8 , due to decreased labor and material costs incurred to service the acquired Aegis customer maintenance contracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Services gross margin increased to 44.4 compared to 38.9 in the same period in 2023, a 5.5 increase. The increase in margin is due to the performance of the Aegis acquired sites and lower costs incurred to replace engines at certain sites compared to 2023. 
 Supply chains were adversely impacted during Covid resulting in significant delays or lack of availability of critical components such as engines. This has continued to have long term impact on service margin. The direct impact has been certain costs increasing faster than inflation. The indirect impact is from increased engine related costs in the service segment as replacements were deferred or overhauled components were used due to lack of parts. We have instituted a service price increase and have also been making engineering improvements to increase service intervals to increase margins. 
 Energy Production 
 Cost of sales for Energy Production in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 212,965 compared to 170,378 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 42,587, or 25.0 . During the three months ended September 30, 2024 our Energy Production gross margin decreased to 45.2 compared to 48.5 for the same period in 2023, a 3.3 decrease. The decrease in the energy production gross margin is due to increased fuel costs at certain of our Energy Production sites in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

The decrease in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the relocation of our manufacturing operations to our new facility in April 2024, which significantly reduced our production capacity and caused certain customer order delays, resulting in a decrease in chiller sales of 3,997,040 and a 414,085 decrease in engineered accessory sales, offset partially by a 318,656 increase in cogeneration sales. Our Products sales mix, as well as product revenue, can vary significantly from period to period as our products are high dollar, low volume sales. 
 Services 
 Service revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 11,991,378, compared to 10,931,744 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1,059,634, or 9.7 . The increase in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the addition of 717,363 in revenue from the acquired Aegis maintenance contracts, 67,884 of revenue representing our share of the excess cash flows above the minimum threshold for the bi-annual period ended June 30, 2024 and a 274,387, or 0.7 , increase in service contract revenues from existing contracts. 
 Our service operation revenues grow with the sale of installed systems because the majority of our product sales are accompanied by a service contract or time and materials agreements, and by the acquisition of maintenance contracts. As a result, our fleet of units being serviced by our service department grows with product sales. 
 Energy Production 
 Energy Production revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,550,549, compared to 1,214,806 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 335,743, or 27.6 . The increase in Energy Production revenue is due to increased run hours at certain energy production sites.

The decrease in cost of sales is due to decreased Products sales, offset partially by increased service contract maintenance costs due to higher labor and material to replace engines at certain sites in 2024, and increased energy production costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 our gross margin increased to 43.1 compared to 40.8 for the same period in 2023, a 2.3 increase due to higher service contract revenue.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Products gross margin was 32.8 compared to 36.6 for the same period in 2023, a 3.8 decrease. The decrease in margin was function of minimal Products revenue, warranty costs and unabsorbed labor costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Services 
 Cost of sales for Services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,423,114 compared to 6,159,855 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 263,259, or 4.3 , due to increased labor and material costs as a consequence of the Aegis customer maintenance contracts acquisition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Services gross margin increased to 46.4 compared to 43.7 in the same period in 2023, a 2.7 increase. The increase in margin is due to decreased cost incurred to service the acquired Aegis customer maintenance, offset by labor and material costs incurred to replace engines at certain sites in 2024. 
 Supply chains were adversely impacted during Covid resulting in significant delays or lack of availability of critical components such as engines. This has continued to have long term impact on product and service margin. The direct impact has been certain costs increasing faster than inflation. The indirect impact is from increased engine related costs in the service segment as replacements were deferred or overhauled components were used due to lack of parts. We have instituted a service price increase and have also been making engineering improvements to increase service intervals to increase margins.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues were negatively impacted due to the relocation of our manufacturing operations to our new facility in April 2024, which significantly reduced our production capacity, caused certain customer order delays or deferrals for our products; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods and a reduction in our energy production revenues due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. 
 On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized management to proceed with an equity offering consisting of a private placement to existing shareholders in an amount of up to 2 million, consisting of one share of common stock, with a warrant to purchase one share of common stock for each share purchased, exercisable within two years. 
 On October 9, 2023, we entered into an agreement with each of John N. Hatsopoulos, a director and principal shareholder of Tecogen, and Earl R. Lewis, III, a director of Tecogen, pursuant to which Mr. Hatsopoulos agreed to provide financing to us of up to 1 million, and Mr. Lewis agreed to provide financing to us of 500,000, and potentially an additional 500,000 at his discretion. On October 10, 2023, we issued a promissory note and borrowed 500,000 from Mr. Hatsopoulos. The note, as amended on March 21, 2024, is due and repayable two years from the date of issuance and bears interest at 5.12 per annum payable in full at maturity. The loan is required to be repaid in the event of a change of control of the company and upon the occurrence of an event of default under the note, including upon a failure to pay the principal and interest when due, or the commencement of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. The proceeds of the loans are expected to be used for general working capital purpose.

TECOGEN INC. 

 On March 21, 2024, John H. Hatsopoulos amended the terms of the Promissory Note dated October 10, 2023, extending the maturity date by one year, to October 10, 2025, and agreeing to accept payment in cash or Tecogen common stock. On July 23, 2024, we borrowed an additional 500,000 from Mr. Hatsopoulos, and executed a promissory note with a maturity of one year and interest at 5.06 per annum. On September 18, 2024, we borrowed 500,000 from Mr. Lewis, and executed a executed a promissory note with a maturity of one year and interest at 4.57 per annum. 
 Based on management's analysis, we believe that cash flows from operations, the note agreements and anticipated proceeds from the private placement offering will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. There can, however, be no assurance we will be able to do so In order to grow our business and fund the development of our hybrid-drive air-cooled chiller and the relocation of our primary facility, we expect that our cash requirements will increase and we may need to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing to meet our need for capital to fund operations and future growth. 

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting policies and estimates that can have a significant impact upon our operating results, financial position and footnote disclosures are described in the above notes and in the Annual Report. 
 
 Significant New Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective 
 The Company's critical accounting policies have remained consistent as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. 
 See Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Seasonality 
 The majority of our chilling systems sold are operational during the summer. Demand for our service team is higher in the warmer months when cooling is required. Chiller units are generally shut down in the winter and started up again in the spring. The chiller "busy season" for the service team generally runs from May through the end of September. Our cogeneration sales are not generally affected by seasonality. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer ("Certifying Officer") conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Securities Exchange Act"), the term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under Section 13(a) or 15(d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including the Certifying Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 33 

TECOGEN INC. 

 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness with respect to a small number of individuals dealing with general controls over information technology. Management will continue to evaluate the above weaknesses and we are taking steps to remediate the weaknesses as resources become available. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Except as described below, there are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. 
 
 On November 23, 2022, we were served with a suit filed against us on August 24, 2022 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by The Corporation of the Town of Milton, Milton Energy Generation Solutions Inc. and Milton Hydro Distribution Inc ("Plaintiffs"), all of whom are municipal corporations incorporated in the Province of Ontario. The plaintiffs sued for damages in the amount of CDN 1,000,000, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, legal fees, alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and nuisance. Plaintiffs allege that on or about July 10, 2022, a Tecogen cogenerator installed by us at the plaintiffs' facility caught fire, causing damage to the cogenerator and the plaintiff's facility. We have filed a response denying liability and are represented by Canadian counsel. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reserved 150,000 for anticipated damages which may not be covered by our insurance and continue to maintain the reserve at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the risks described below, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under "Item1A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K") The risks discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K and below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 We incurred a net loss from operations of 3,397,075 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss from operations of 2,598,287 in the same period in 2023. We have a history of incurring losses from our operations and there can be no assurance we will be able to increase our revenues, manage our expenses and cash flows, and become profitable in the future. 
 We incurred a net loss from operations of 3,397,075 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss from operations of 2,598,287 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Historically, we have incurred net losses from operations, including a net loss of 4,598,103 in the year ended December 31, 2023, and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 46,453,827. Our business is capital intensive and, because our products are built to order with customized configurations, the lead time to build and deliver a unit can be significant. We may be required to purchase key components long before we can deliver a unit and receive payment. Changes in customer orders or lack of demand may also impact our profitability. There can be no assurance we will be able to increase our sales and achieve and sustain profitability in the future. On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized management to proceed with an equity offering consisting of a private placement to existing shareholders in an amount of up to 2 million, consisting of one share of common stock, with a warrant to purchase one share of common stock for each share purchsed, exercisable within two years. Based on management's analysis, we believe that cash flows from operations, the note agreements and anticipated proceeds from the private placement offering will be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. There can, however, be no assurance we will be able to do so. If our cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our business we must continue to rely upon financing provided by related parties to help fund our operations and we may need to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing to meet our need for capital to fund operations and future growth. See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity.
