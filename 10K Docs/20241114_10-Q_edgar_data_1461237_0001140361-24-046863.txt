Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

September 30, 2024

1. Organization and Business

Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC GAIT was formed on May 18, 2006, commenced operations on August 1, 2006 and is organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company. Graham Capital Management, L.P. (the
 Manager is the Manager and the sole investment advisor. The Manager is registered as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and is a member of the National Futures
 Association. The Manager is also registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. GAIT is a commodity pool, and as such is subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the CFTC.

The investment objective of GAIT is to achieve long-term capital appreciation through professionally managed trading through its investment in various master trading vehicles Master Funds ). As more fully described
 in Notes 2 and 3, these Master Funds invest in a broad range of derivative instruments such as currency forward and futures contracts; bond, interest rate, and index futures contracts; commodity forward and futures contracts, and options and swaps
 thereon traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges, as well as over-the-counter OTC ).

Graham Alternative Investment Fund I LLC Core Macro Portfolio, Graham Alternative Investment Fund II LLC Core Macro Portfolio (through its investment in Graham Alternative Investment Ltd.) and the Manager are the
 only investors of GAIT.

SEI Global Services, Inc. SEI is GAIT s independent administrator and transfer agent. SEI is responsible for certain matters pertaining to the administration of GAIT.

GAIT will terminate on December 31, 2050 or at an earlier date if certain conditions occur as outlined in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement LLC Agreement ).

Duties of the Manager

Subject to the terms and conditions of the LLC Agreement, the Manager has complete and exclusive responsibility for managing and administering the affairs of GAIT and for directing the investment and reinvestment of
 the assets of GAIT.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars. GAIT is an investment company and applies
 specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The preparation of these
 financial statements requires the Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Master Funds

GAIT invests in various Master Funds which are managed by the Manager. These investments are valued in the accompanying statements of financial condition at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP based upon GAIT s
 proportionate share of the Master Funds reported net asset values. Gains and losses are allocated monthly by each Master Fund to GAIT based upon GAIT s proportionate share of the net asset value of each Master Fund and are included in the
 statements of operations and incentive allocation.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Due from/to Brokers

Due from/to brokers on the Master Funds financial statements primarily consist of cash balances carried as margin deposits with clearing brokers for the purpose of trading in futures contracts, foreign currency
 contracts and other derivative financial instruments and securities, and receivables/payables for unsettled transactions. Substantially all of the Master Funds cash and investments are held as collateral by its brokers to secure derivative
 instruments and securities.

Revenue Recognition

All positions in financial instruments are recorded on the trade date at fair value. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on open derivative financial instruments is included in the Master Funds statements of
 financial condition as the difference between the original purchase price and the current market value at year end. Any change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation from the preceding period is reported in the Master Funds statements of
 operations. Interest income and expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends, if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are net of applicable withholding taxes. All other expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and
 losses are calculated based on the specific identification method.

Brokerage Commissions and Fees

Brokerage commissions and fees on the Master Funds financial statements represent all brokerage commissions and other fees incurred in connection with the Master Funds trading activity and are recorded on the
 accrual basis.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
 calculated using daily exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. The Master Funds do not isolate the portion of results of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments and cash from fluctuations arising from changes in
 market prices of investments held. The Master Funds currency translation gains and losses are included in the statements of operations and incentive allocation within net realized (loss) gain and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation
 on investments.

Fair Value

The fair value of GAIT s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP, approximates the carrying amounts presented in the statements of financial condition. Changes in these carrying
 amounts are included in the statements of operations and incentive allocation.

GAIT follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAIT reports the fair
 value of its investment related assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the activeness of the market and the transparency and
 independence of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

23 

Index 

Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair Value (continued)

The fair value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one of three levels, as summarized below, based on the inputs and assumptions used in deriving fair value.

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.

Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities obtained from independent brokers and/or market makers in each security.

Level 3 inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are significant in arriving at fair value.

GAIT s investments in the Master Funds and Graham Cash Assets LLC Cash Assets have been valued at net asset value using the practical expedient. Accordingly, under U.S. GAAP, these investments are excluded from
 categorization in the fair value hierarchy. GAIT s investments in the Master Funds and Cash Assets are discussed in Notes 3 and 4. There were no Level 3 assets or liabilities held at any point during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the
 year ended December 31, 2023 by GAIT, the Master Funds, or Cash Assets.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Master Funds utilize derivative financial instruments in connection with their trading activities. Derivative instruments derive their value from underlying assets, indices,
 reference rates or a combination of these factors. Investments in derivative financial instruments are subject to additional risks that can result in a loss of all or part of an investment. The Master Funds derivative financial instruments are
 classified by the following primary underlying risks: interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price, and equity price risks. These risks can be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. In
 addition, the Master Funds are also subject to additional counterparty risk should their counterparties fail to meet the terms of their contracts. Management of counterparty risk involves a number of considerations, such as the financial profile of
 the counterparty, specific terms and duration of the contractual agreement, and the value of collateral held, if any. The Master Funds have established initial credit approval, credit limits, and collateral requirements and may reduce their
 exposure to any counterparties they deem necessary. Trading in non-U.S. dollar denominated derivative instruments may subject the value of, and gains and losses associated with, such contracts to additional risks related to adverse changes in the
 applicable exchange rates.

Unrealized appreciation and depreciation from derivative financial instruments are recorded based on changes in their fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded when the positions are closed. All unrealized
 and realized gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments are included in net realized (loss) gain and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation on investments in the Master Funds statements of operations.

Futures Contracts

The Master Funds use futures contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in the value of equities, commodities, interest rates, bonds, and foreign currencies. Futures contracts are valued based upon the
 closing price as of the valuation date established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Derivative Instruments (continued)

Futures Contracts (continued)

A futures contract represents a commitment for the future purchase or sale of an asset or cash settlement based on the value of an asset on a specified date. The purchase and sale of futures contracts are executed on
 an exchange which requires margin deposits with a Futures Commission Merchant FCM ). Subsequent payments are made or received by the Master Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract. These changes in
 valuation are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized appreciation and depreciation by the Master Funds. Relative to over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, futures contracts provide reduced counterparty risk to the
 Master Funds since futures are exchange-traded and the exchanges clearing house guarantees the futures against default. However, some non-U.S. exchanges are principals markets in which no common clearing facility exists, and the Master Funds
 may look only to the clearing broker for performance of the contract. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all funds received from such FCM s customers in respect of regulated futures transactions. If the FCM were not to do
 so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Master Funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the FCM. In that case, the Master Funds would be limited to potentially recovering only a pro-rata
 share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the FCM s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Master Funds was held by the FCM. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an
 exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the Master Funds might experience a loss of funds deposited through its FCM as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of
 funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions.

Forward Contracts

The Master Funds enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in exchange rates. Forward currency transactions are contracts or agreements for delivery of specific
 currencies or the cash equivalent value at a specified future date and an agreed upon price. Forward contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or clearing house and therefore the risks include the inability of counterparties to meet their
 obligations under the terms of the contracts as well as the risks associated with movements in fair value.

All forward contracts are valued based upon a forward curve constructed using independently quoted forward points. Changes in fair value of each forward contract are recognized as unrealized appreciation and
 depreciation.

Swap Contracts

The Master Funds may enter into various swap contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and asset values. Exchange cleared swap contracts are cleared on an exchange
 which requires margin deposits with a Central Clearing Counterparty CCP ). Subsequent payments are made or received by the Master Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract. These changes in valuation are
 recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized appreciation or depreciation by the Master Funds. The Master Funds records realized gains or losses when a swap contract is terminated. Relative to
 OTC interest rate swap contracts, exchange cleared interest rate swap contracts provide reduced counterparty risk since they are exchange-cleared, and the exchange s clearinghouse guarantees against default. The Commodity Exchange Act requires a
 CCP to segregate all funds received from such CCP s customers in respect of exchange cleared interest rate swaps. If the CCP were not to do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Master Funds might not be fully protected in the
 event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the CCP. In that case, the Master Funds would be limited to recovering only a pro-rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the CCP s combined customer accounts, even though certain property
 specifically traceable to the Master Funds is held by the CCP. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the Master Funds could experience a loss of funds deposited through its CCP as
 margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions. All funds deposited with both U.S. and non-U.S. CCPs are
 included in due from brokers on the statement of financial condition of the Master Funds. OTC swap contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or an affiliated clearing house or regulated by any U.S. or foreign government authorities. Failure of a
 counterparty to meet its obligation under the terms of the swap contract could result in the loss of any unrealized appreciation on open positions. It may not be possible to dispose of or close out a swap position without the consent of the
 counterparty, and the Master Funds may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover its risk.

An interest rate swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified
 rates for a specified notional amount. The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to another. Interest rate swap positions are generally valued as the present value of the net future cash
 flows as estimated by the Advisor using a discount curve constructed from independently obtained future interest rate assumptions. Interest is calculated and accrued throughout the life of each swap and is included in interest receivable and
 interest payable on the Master Funds statements of financial condition. Payments received at the end of each reset period are recorded against such accruals.

A total return swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange cash flows calculated by reference to changes in specified prices for a specified notional amount of the
 underlying assets. The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to another. Total return swaps are generally valued based upon the value of the underlying instruments and terms of the contract
 as determined by the primary exchange on which they are traded.

Options

The Master Funds may buy and sell covered and uncovered exchange-traded and over-the-counter options on futures, foreign currencies, commodities, interest rates and equities to take advantage of the price movements
 of the financial instrument underlying the option or to hedge positions in the underlying assets. Option contracts give one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time or on a specified date, a financial
 instrument, commodity, or currency at a contracted price. Options may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices.

When purchasing options, the Master Funds are exposed to counterparty risk to the extent that a seller of an over-the-counter option does not meet its obligations under the terms of the option contract. The maximum
 risk of loss to the Master Funds is the unrealized appreciation of the contracts and the premiums paid to purchase its open option contracts. Relative to over-the-counter options, exchange-traded options provide reduced counterparty risk to the
 Master Funds since the exchanges clearinghouse guarantees the option against default.

Selling uncovered options may subject the Master Funds to unlimited risk of loss. As the writer of an option, the Master Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying instrument.

Exchange-traded options are valued based upon the settlement prices published as of the valuation date by the principal exchange upon which they are traded. In the absence of an exchange published settlement price,
 the option will be valued using the last reported sales price reported on the exchange for the valuation date. Over-the-counter options and exchange-traded options with no reported sales price on the valuation date will generally be valued at the
 average of the last reported bid and offer quotes from independent brokers or from the exchange, respectively.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features

OTC derivative instruments are subject to ISDA Master Agreements which generally require among other things, that the Master Funds maintain a predetermined level of net assets or rate of return and provide limits
 with respect to any decline in value over 1-month, 3-month and 12-month periods. If the Master Funds were to violate such provisions, the counterparty to these instruments could demand liquidation of the outstanding positions. There were no events
 that occurred throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 which caused any counterparty to demand liquidation of any outstanding positions. Graham K4D Trading Ltd. had derivative instruments subject to
 credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position in the amount of 0 and 8,339,776 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Graham Commodity Strategies LLC had no derivative instruments subject to credit risk
 related contingent features in a net liability position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Graham Derivatives Strategies LLC had derivative instruments subject to credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position of 0
 and 4,589 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 financial condition. The COMEX seats are considered Level 1 assets as described in the Fair Value section of Note 2.

Fixed Income Securities

The fixed income securities positions, held by the Master Funds where applicable, are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask quotations received from independent brokers. GAIT is exposed to credit
 risk relating to whether the issuers will meet their obligations when they come due until the fixed income securities held by the Master Funds are sold or reach maturity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

GAIT classifies all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase as cash equivalents. Cash deposited with a bank is subject to credit risk. In the event of the bank s
 insolvency, recovery of GAIT s cash would be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded by such deposit. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, GAIT did not have any cash or cash equivalents.

Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, the Master Funds, Cash Assets, and GAIT enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Such contracts may include those by Cash Assets and the Master Funds with
 their brokers and trading counterparties. GAIT s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown; however, GAIT has not had prior claims or losses with respect to such indemnifications and considers the risk of loss to be remote. At September
 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no accruals have been recorded by GAIT for indemnifications.

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

3. Investments in Master Funds (continued)

The following table displays the gross volume of derivative activities categorized by primary underlying risk of Graham Commodity Strategies LLC based on its average quarterly notional amounts and number of contracts
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The table also displays the fair value of derivative contracts held by Graham Commodity Strategies LLC at September 30, 2024 categorized by primary underlying risk. The fair value of derivative
 contracts is included in derivative financial instruments on the statements of financial condition. Derivatives denominated in foreign currencies have been converted to U.S. dollars. Derivative asset and derivative liability balances are presented
 on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. The Master Funds trade derivative instruments on a leveraged basis. Due to the low margin deposits normally required for trading these derivative financial instruments, the gross
 notional exposure as displayed in the tables below may exceed the net asset value of the Master Funds by a significant amount. As a result, a relatively small price movement in an underlying derivative financial instrument may result in immediate
 and substantial effect on the net income and net asset value of the Master Funds and GAIT.

3. Investments in Master Funds (continued)

The following table displays the gross volume of derivative activities categorized by primary underlying risk of Graham Derivatives Strategies LLC based on its average quarterly notional amounts and number of
 contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The table also displays the fair value of derivative contracts held by Graham Derivatives Strategies LLC at September 30, 2024 categorized by primary underlying risk. The fair value of
 derivative contracts is included in derivative financial instruments on the statements of financial condition. Derivatives denominated in foreign currencies have been converted to U.S. dollars. Derivative asset and derivative liability balances are
 presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. The Master Funds trade derivative instruments on a leveraged basis. Due to the low margin deposits normally required for trading these derivative financial instruments,
 the gross notional exposure as displayed in the tables below may exceed the net asset value of the Master Funds by a significant amount. As a result, a relatively small price movement in an underlying derivative financial instrument may result in
 immediate and substantial effect on the net income and net asset value of the Master Funds and GAIT.

3. Investments in Master Funds (continued)

When multiple derivative contracts are held with the same counterparty, the Master Funds will net the contracts in an asset position with the contracts in a liability position when covered by a master netting
 agreement or similar arrangements, for presentation in the statements of financial condition. The table below displays the amounts at September 30, 2024 by which the fair values of both derivative assets and derivative liabilities were reduced
 within the Master Funds statements of financial condition as a result of this netting. Gross amounts below correspond to the total derivative asset and derivative liability balances categorized by primary underlying risk and product type in the
 preceding tables. Collateral pledged (received) for derivative assets and derivative liabilities represent the cash amounts which are included in due from brokers on the statements of financial condition. Actual collateral pledged or received by
 the Master Funds may exceed these amounts.

3. Investments in Master Funds (continued)

The following table displays the gross volume of derivative activities categorized by primary underlying risk of Graham Commodity Strategies LLC based on its average quarterly notional amounts and number of contracts
 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The table also displays the fair value of derivative contracts held by Graham Commodity Strategies LLC at December 31, 2023 categorized by primary underlying risk. The fair value of derivative contracts is
 included in derivative financial instruments on the Master Funds statements of financial condition. Derivatives denominated in foreign currencies have been converted to U.S. dollars. Derivative asset and derivative liability balances are presented
 on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. The Master Funds trade derivative instruments on a leveraged basis. Due to the low margin deposits normally required for trading these derivative financial instruments, the gross
 notional exposure as displayed in the tables below may exceed the net asset value of the Master Funds by a significant amount. As a result, a relatively small price movement in an underlying derivative financial instrument may result in immediate
 and substantial effect on the net income and net asset value of the Master Funds and GAIT.

3. Investments in Master Funds (continued)

When multiple derivative contracts are held with the same counterparty, the Master Funds will net the contracts in an asset position with the contracts in a liability position when covered by a master netting
 agreement or similar arrangements, for presentation in the statements of financial condition. The table below displays the amounts at December 31, 2023 by which the fair values of both derivative assets and derivative liabilities were reduced
 within the Master Funds statements of financial condition as a result of this netting. Gross amounts below correspond to the total derivative asset and derivative liability balances categorized by primary underlying risk and product type in the
 preceding tables. Collateral pledged (received) for derivative assets and derivative liabilities represent the cash amounts which are included in due from brokers on the statements of financial condition. Actual collateral pledged or received by
 the Master Funds may exceed these amounts.

4. Graham Cash Assets LLC

GAIT invests a portion of its excess liquidity in Cash Assets, an entity for which the Manager is also the sole investment advisor. Cash Assets commenced operations on June 22, 2005 and was formed as a Delaware
 Limited Liability Company for the purpose of consolidating investment activity of multiple funds managed by the Manager. Its objective is to preserve capital while enhancing return on cash balances and providing daily liquidity. Cash Assets
 maintains cash and cash equivalents on deposit with major U.S. institutions, which may exceed federally insured limits. It also invests in debt obligations guaranteed by the U.S. Federal government, which generally range in maturity from one day to
 thirty months. Cash Assets currently intends to hold all fixed income securities until maturity and values them at amortized cost which approximates fair value. If Cash Assets were forced to sell some of its securities in the open market before
 they mature to meet unanticipated redemption requests (whether from GAIT or other entities affiliated with the Manager), the market value of the securities at such time may be below their amortized cost, causing a loss for GAIT s investors. GAIT s
 investment in Cash Assets is valued in the accompanying statements of financial condition at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP based upon GAIT s proportionate share of Cash Assets reported net asset value. GAIT s investment in Cash Assets at
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is 58,564,739 and 59,261,119 which represents a percentage of GAIT s Members Capital of 89.60 and 91.33 , respectively.

GAIT records its proportionate share of Cash Assets investment income and expenses on a monthly basis. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total amount recognized by GAIT with respect to its
 investment in Cash Assets was 726,500 and 2,243,924, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total amount recognized by GAIT with respect to its investment in Cash Assets was 700,034 and 1,563,219,
 respectively. These amounts are included in both interest income and net realized (loss) gain on investment in the statements of operations and incentive allocation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, GAIT owned approximately 0.91 and
 1.02 , respectively, of Cash Assets. The following table summarizes the financial position of Cash Assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

7. Income Taxes

No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as members are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of GAIT s income and
 expenses for income tax purposes.

U.S. GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected
 to be taken in the course of preparing GAIT s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold
 would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. GAIT identifies its major tax jurisdictions as the U.S. for Federal tax purposes, Connecticut for state tax purposes and various international jurisdictions. The Manager has evaluated GAIT s
 tax positions for all open tax years under the respective statutes of limitations (generally three years in the U.S. but varying in non-U.S. jurisdictions) and has concluded that there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition,
 measurement, or disclosure in the financial statements. The Manager is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the next twelve months. Tax years
 which are considered open by the relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential examination. Any assessment for interest or penalties on taxes related to uncertain tax positions, when present, would be included in interest and penalties on tax on
 the statements of operations and incentive allocation. No such interest and/or penalties were assessed to GAIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

8. Risk Factors

Global economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect GAIT s operations. The current global financial market situation, as well as various social and political circumstances in the United States and
 around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may contribute to increased market
 volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. Such impacts may affect the financial markets in which the GAIT operates.

Total return is calculated for Class 0, Class 2, Class 3-A and Class 3-B units taken as a whole. Total return is calculated as the change in total Members Capital, excluding that of the Manager, adjusted for
 subscriptions or redemptions during the period. An individual member s return may vary from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions and the applicability of Advisory Fees, Sponsor Fees, Administrator s Fee, and the Incentive
 Allocation. The net investment income (loss) and total expense ratios (including Incentive Allocation) are calculated for the Class 0, Class 2, Class 3-A and Class 3-B units taken as a whole and include amounts from GAIT and net investment income
 (loss) and expenses allocated from Master Funds and investment income from Cash Assets. The computation of such ratios is based on the amount of net investment income (loss), total expenses and Incentive Allocation. Net investment income (loss) and
 total expense ratios are computed based upon the weighted average of Members Capital of GAIT, excluding that of the Manager, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and have not been annualized.

10. Subsequent Events

GAIT had subscriptions of approximately 4.6 million and redemptions of approximately 0.7 million from October 1, 2024 through November 14, 2024, the date through which subsequent events were evaluated by
 management. These amounts have not been included in the financial statements.

The Core Macro Portfolio posted trading losses in the third quarter of 2024, particularly during July and early August when global markets experienced significant short-term volatility and sharp
 reversals. Currencies were the weakest performing sector due to long exposure to the U.S. dollar versus several global counterparts, including the euro, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. In equities, mixed long and short positioning in
 U.S. benchmark indices and long positions in Japanese and European benchmark indices led to losses. The portfolio recorded losses in fixed income from trading long and short across the yield curves in the U.S. and Europe. In commodities, long
 positions in metals and coffee drove gains, which were partially offset by losses from mixed long and short positions in various energy markets.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund s net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, interest income,

 long positions in Japanese benchmark indices and the NASDAQ Index led to gains. Mixed long and short positions across the U.S. yield curve led to profits in fixed income, which were partially offset by losses from mixed positions across the
 European yield curve. In currencies, losses resulted mainly from long exposure to the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Chinese yuan during the third quarter, as well as from long positions in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar and mixed
 positions in the New Zealand dollar and Australian dollar.

 ended September 30, 2022, where the portfolio did not experience a loss carryforward.

The following table illustrates the sector distribution of the Fund s investments in Master Funds as of September 30, 2023 based on the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in each
 Master Fund including both long and short positions. Positive percentages represent net assets whereas negative percentages represent a net liability.

Variables Affecting Performance

The Fund s performance is affected by net profitability resulting from the trading operations of the Master Funds, the fees charged by the Fund, and interest income earned on cash
 and cash equivalents. The Master Funds acquire and liquidate fixed income positions, long and short positions in futures contracts, forwards contracts, spot currency contracts and associated derivative instruments such as options and swaps. These
 instruments are carried at fair value, which is heavily influenced by a wide variety of factors including but not limited to, the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices as well as global macro
 political events. These factors generate market movements affecting the fair value of these instruments and in turn the net gains and losses allocated from the Master Funds.

Advisory, Sponsor, and Administrator s Fees are calculated based on a percentage of the Fund s net asset value. Changes in the net assets of the Fund resulting from subscriptions,
 redemptions, interest and trading profits allocated from the Master Funds can therefore have a material impact on the fee expense of the Fund.

A portion of the assets of the Fund is held in cash and cash equivalents. Changes in the net assets of the Fund as well as changes in the interest rates earned on these
 investments can have a material impact on interest income earned.

(ii) Liquidity

There are no known demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will result in or are reasonably likely to result in the Fund s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any
 material way.

A portion of the Fund s assets is generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Fund s investments. It is expected that the
 average margin the Fund will be required to post to support the Fund s trading may range between 10 and 30 of the Fund s total assets, which will be segregated or secured by the futures brokers in accordance with the CEA and with CFTC
 regulations or be maintained on deposit with over-the-counter counterparties. In exceptional market conditions, this amount could increase. The Master Funds are subject to margin calls on a constant daily and intra-day basis, whether in
 connection with initiating new investment positions or as a result of changes in the value of current investment positions. These margin requirements are met through the posting of additional margin with the applicable futures or FX clearing
 broker, on an almost daily basis. The Manager generally expresses its margin requirements for the portfolios in terms of the aggregate of the margin requirements for the underlying strategies plus the net option premium costs for the underlying
 strategies. The following table shows these amounts as of the date indicated:

Core Macro Portfolio

September 30, 2024

10.59

December 31, 2023

10.04

September 30, 2023

9.37

Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Fund s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. Market-imposed limitations, when they occur,
 can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Fund s futures trading. Through September 30, 2024, the Fund experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of
 the markets traded by the Manager on behalf of the Fund.

Index 

(iii) Capital Resources

The Fund raises additional capital through the sale of Units and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income. The Fund may borrow money from brokers
 or their affiliates and other lenders. Units may be offered for sale as of the beginning, and may be redeemed as of the end, of each month. The amount of capital raised for the Fund should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the
 Fund has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for monies to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses.

The Fund participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements. The minimum amount of margin
 required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges. Further, the Fund s brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements. The Fund bears the risk of financial
 failure of the brokers through which it clears trades and maintains margin in respect of any such trades and of its counterparties for its foreign exchange and swap trades with whom it also maintains margin.

(iv) Critical Accounting Estimates 

Presentation Graham Alternative Investment Fund II LLC is a series Limited Liability Company under Delaware law. The financial statements and
 corresponding footnotes are presented solely for the Core Macro Portfolio, except where otherwise noted.

Use of Estimates The Fund s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 U.S. GAAP and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars except where noted. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
 financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Fund s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement The Fund follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
 measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the activeness of the market and the transparency and independence of inputs used in
 the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The Fund reports the fair value of its investment-related assets and liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP.

The Fund records its investments in GAIT at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In determining its net asset value, GAIT records its investments in Master Funds at fair value
 in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Fund records its proportionate share of GAIT s investment income and loss, expenses, fees, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis. Purchases and sales of units in GAIT are recorded on a
 trade date basis.

The Master Funds record all their financial instruments at fair value, which is derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unrealized appreciation and depreciation from these
 instruments are recorded based on changes in their fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded when the positions are closed. All unrealized and realized gains and losses related to financial instruments are included in net gain (loss) on
 investments in the Master Funds statements of operations.

Investment Company The Fund is an investment company and applies specialized accounting guidance
 as outlined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946 Update 2013-08, Financial Services Investment Companies , Amendments to
 the Scope, Measurement, and Disclosure Requirements . The Manager has evaluated this guidance and has determined the Fund meets the criteria to be classified as an investment company.

Cash Assets GAIT invests a portion of its excess liquidity in Cash Assets, an entity for which the Manager is also the sole investment advisor. The
 financial information of Cash Assets is included in the notes to the financial statements of GAIT.

75 

Index 

Income Taxes No provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund s financial statements, as each member is responsible for reporting income or loss
 based upon the member s respective share of the Fund s revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.

U.S. GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. U.S. GAAP requires
 the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions
 not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year and the Fund identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut State. The Manager has evaluated the Fund s tax
 positions and has concluded that there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition, measurement, or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements for all open tax years. The Manager is not aware of any tax positions for which it
 is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the next twelve months. Tax years which are considered open by the relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential examination.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 

The Fund and GAIF II has each established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that it files or submits under the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Manager and the management of
 the Fund and GAIF II, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, the Manager, along with the Manager s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that the disclosure controls
 and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the Fund and GAIF II were effective.

With respect to the certifications of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer included as Exhibit 31 hereto, the financial statements referred to therein and the
 representations and determinations of those officers contained in such certifications refer to and apply to both the Fund and GAIF II.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes to the internal control over financial reporting of the Fund and GAIF II during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
 materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.
