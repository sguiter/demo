 (the Common Stock at a ratio in the range between 1:5 and 1:30 , with the final ratio to be approved by the Company's board of directors (the "Board"). The Board approved a final ratio of 1 for 25 for the reverse stock split. On August 27, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to effect a 1 for 25 reverse stock split of the Common Stock, effective as of 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on August 28, 2024. The par value and authorized shares were not adjusted as a result of the reverse split. The Reverse Stock Split also affected the Company s outstanding common stock options and pre-funded warrants, and resulted in the shares underlying such instruments being reduced and the exercise price being increased proportionately. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock and per share amounts contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split for all periods presented. Liquidity and Risks Since inception, the Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and used million of cash in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with no approved products or revenue streams, which contributes to its ongoing operating losses and negative cash flows. Management expects to continue to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future as the Company continues its development efforts on advancing FB102 through clinical trials. Given these factors, the Company has concluded that the existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for the twelve months following the financial statement issuance date, and requires additional liquidity to continue its operations. As the Company continues to pursue its business plan, it expects to finance its operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, which may include strategic collaborations and other strategic arrangements with third parties. However, the Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as going concern exists.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of a specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure. This ASU includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2024, but early adoption is permitted. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Legal Proceedings Camac Fund L.P. v. Forte Biosciences Inc. , C.A. No. 2022-1075-NAC (Del. Ch.) In November 2022, a stockholder of the Company, Camac Fund LP, filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to access certain books and records of the Company pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as well as to seek attorney fees (the Books and Records Action ).

million authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value , with shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Common Stock On July 31, 2023, the Company issued shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of per Share and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of 

 14 

per pre-funded warrant ("Private Placement") in connection with a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ). The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of per share of common stock, are immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The holders of pre-funded warrants may not exercise a pre-funded warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The holders of pre-funded warrants may increase or decrease such percentages not in excess of by providing at least days prior notice to the Company. The Purchase Agreement also provides certain investors a participation right in future offerings of the Company s equity securities. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company filed a registration statement to register shares on Form S-3 that was declared effective on September 8, 2023. The gross proceeds of the Private Placement were million and the Company incurred thousand in issuance costs. Certain executive officers, senior management, and board members of the Company participated in this Private Placement, purchasing million of shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share. As of September 30, 2024 , pre-funded warrants were exercised and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of common stock remain outstanding. The shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the pre-funded warrants is not included in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In June 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that went effective in June 2021 to register the issuance of up to million in securities. On March 31, 2022, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity offering program ATM Facility whereby the Company may from time to time offer and sell shares of its common stock up to an aggregate offering price of million during the term of the ATM Facility. On April 1, 2022, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the June 2021 Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale of the shares pursuant to the ATM Facility covering sales of up to million of shares of common stock. On August 12, 2022, the Company filed an additional prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of shares pursuant to the ATM Facility covering sales of up to an additional million of shares of common stock. However, this shelf registration statement on Form S-3 expired in June 2024, and the Company would need to file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to sell additional shares under the ATM Facility. The Company is not obligated to sell any shares under the ATM Facility. The ATM Facility may be terminated at any time upon ten days prior notice, or at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has agreed to pay the sales agent a commission equal to of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares under the ATM Facility and has agreed to provide the sales agent with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company issued million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million under the ATM Facility from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 and incurred thousand in issuance costs related to the ATM Facility and shelf registration statement. While the ATM Facility remains in place, the Company remains restricted in its ability to access additional funding from the sale of securities under Form S-3.

All option awards generally expire from the date of grant. The expected term assumption for options granted to employees is determined using the simplified method that represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted average vesting period of the option. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.

 Overview 
 
 Forte Biosciences, Inc. www.fortebiorx.com and its subsidiaries Forte , we , our is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company whose lead product candidate is FB102. FB102 is a proprietary anti-CD122 monoclonal antibody therapeutic candidate with potentially broad autoimmune and autoimmune-related indications. 
 Our FB102 program aims to address key pathways implicated in these indications with a CD122 antagonist. CD122 is a subunit of IL-2/IL-15 receptors which are key regulators of NK cells and certain T cell subsets. 
 In FB102 mechanistic in-vitro studies, human donor T and NK cells were stimulated with either IL2 or IL15 in the presence or absence of FB102. FB102 significantly inhibited proliferation (4-5x inhibition in the proliferation of T cells and 6-8 fold inhibition in the proliferation of NK cells) and also inhibited activation of T cells. The level of FB102 inhibition of proliferation and activation was at levels comparable to unstimulated cells. Human donor regulatory T cell (Treg) studies stimulated with IL2 demonstrated comparable proliferation both in the presence and 
 20 

absence of FB102. Additionally, in-vitro assays demonstrated superiority of FB102 compared to competing antibodies. 
 In the 4- and 13-week non-human primate (NHP) studies, after a single dose, FB102 demonstrated significant reductions in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker (up to approximately 80 -90 ). Additionally, after multiple doses at exposures comparable to human therapeutic doses, Treg levels in the FB102 dosing arm were similar to vehicle supporting the in-vitro data and the mechanism of action of FB102. 
 The primary objective of the Phase 1 trial was to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of FB102. Three cohorts of single and two cohorts of multiple ascending doses in healthy volunteers were successfully completed and demonstrated a good safety profile. No dose limiting toxicities were observed. FB102 demonstrated significant reductions in the NK cell pharmacodynamic marker (greater than approximately 70 ). Based on the successful completion of the phase 1 healthy volunteer cohorts, we initiated a patient-based trial in celiac disease in the third quarter of 2024. The study is currently enrolling and top-line results are expected in the second quarter of 2025. 
 Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that is triggered by consuming gluten and results in damage to the small intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea, fatigue, headaches, anemia, nausea and dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy skin rash). A significant patient population of celiac disease patients do not respond to gluten free diet. The health consequences for not treating include malnourishment, cancer, other autoimmune conditions. It is estimated that 1:133 in US (2.5 million people) have celiac disease (Fasano, Arch Intern Med. 2003 PMID: 12578508) and that 0.3 to 0.5 of celiac disease patients are non-responsive (Malamut Gastroenterology. 2024 38556189). There are no approved treatment options for celiac disease. 
 FB102 has potentially other autoimmune and autoimmune-related applications including vitiligo, alopecia areata, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). 
 Vitiligo is a disease of the skin mediated primarily by NK and CD8+ T cells that attack melanocytes leading to patchy depigmentation of the skin. It is estimated that vitiligo affects 2 million people in the U.S (NIH). The global vitiligo treatment market size was estimated at 1.2 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach 1.9 billion by 2026 (Fortune Business Insights). 
 Alopecia areata is a disease in which immune cells attack and damage hair follicles and is mediated primarily by CD8+ T cells and NK cells. The global alopecia treatment market was valued at 2.7 billion in 2018, and is projected to reach 3.9 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 4.6 from 2019 to 2026 (Allied Mkt Research) . 
 Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoreactive T Cells destroying insulin-producing pancreatic - cells. CD8+ T cells with receptors recognizing -cell specific peptides are enriched in pancreatic islets of T1D patients. Environmental stress causes -cells to upregulate MHC and to express IL-15 and IL-15RA. (Herold 2024 Nat Rev Immunol. PMID 38308004). It is estimated that 64,000 people are diagnosed with T1D annually (https://beyondtype1.org/type-1-diabetes-statistics/). 
 GvHD is a complication that may occur after an allogeneic transplant and is where donor's T-cells attack the patient's healthy cells. There are 2 main types of GvHD acute GvHD and chronic GvHD. The severity of symptoms range from mild to fatal. U.S. prevalence of acute GvHD is estimated at approximately 5,000 cases and occurs in up to 50 of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (www.lls.org/booklet/graft-versus-host-disease). 
 We had approximately 16.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol FBRX. Prior to our merger with Tocagen, Inc., a publicly traded biotechnology company, Forte was a privately held company incorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2017. 
 On July 31, 2023, we issued 606,678 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 25.15 per Share, and 387,566 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of 25.13 per pre-funded warrant ("Private Placement"). The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of 0.025 per share of common stock, are immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The gross proceeds of the Private Placement were 25.0 million and we incurred 272 thousand in issuance costs. Certain of our executive officers, senior management, and board members participated in this Private Placement, purchasing 1.16 million of shares 
 21 

of common stock at a purchase price of 25.25 per share. In connection with the Private Placement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective on September 8, 2023. 
 In June 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that went effective in June 2021 to register the issuance of up to 300 million in securities. On March 31, 2022, we entered into an ATM Facility whereby we may from time to time offer and sell shares of its common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 25.0 million during the term of the ATM Facility. On April 1, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement to the June 2021 Form S-3 for the offer and sale of the shares under the ATM Facility covering sales of up to 7.0 million of shares of common stock. On August 12, 2022, we filed an additional prospectus supplement relating to offer and sell an additional 2.7 million of shares of common stock. However, this shelf registration statement on Form S-3 expired in June 2024, and the Company would need to file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to sell additional shares under the ATM Facility. We are currently eligible to sell securities under Form S-3 only if and to the extent the aggregate market value of securities sold by us pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 during the twelve-month period immediately prior to, and including, the date of any such sale, does not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3), and we will remain subject to such limitation for so long as the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 75.0 million (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3). As such, while the ATM Facility remains in place, we remain restricted in our ability to access additional funding from the sale of securities under Form S-3. 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 We own one US patent for administering a combination of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria along with metabolites for treatment of a wide variety of skin conditions. The patent s estimated expiration date is 2039. This patent is not material to Forte s FB102 program. We also own three pending PCT applications, one pending application in Taiwan and one pending application in Argentina related to the FB102 program. The estimated expiration dates of these patents are 2043-2044. We also own one pending PCT application that is not material to Forte's FB102 program. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 
 Businesses throughout our industry have been and will continue to be impacted by a number of challenging and unexpected global and national events and circumstances that continue to evolve, including without limitation, the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, increased economic uncertainty, inflation, rising interest rates, recent and any potential future financial institution failures, and other geopolitical tensions. The extent of the impact of these events and circumstances on our business, operations and development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and scope of the events and their impact on our development activities, third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. We have been and continue to actively monitor the potential impacts that these various events and circumstances may have on our business and we take steps, where warranted, to minimize any potential negative impacts on our business resulting from these events and circumstances. 
 Components of Operating Results 
 Revenue 
 We have no products approved for commercial sale or in active development and have not generated any revenue from product sales. In the future, we may generate revenue from product sales, royalties on product sales, license fees, milestones, or other upfront payments if we enter into any collaborations or license agreements. We expect that our future revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter for many reasons, including the uncertain timing and amount of any such payments and sales. 
 22 

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits of research and development personnel and costs related to research activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and drug manufacturing. Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used in future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and are only expensed when the goods have been received or when the service has been performed rather than when the payment is made. 
 Drug manufacturing and clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses. The Company expenses costs for its drug manufacturing activities performed by Contract Manufacturing Organizations CMOs ), costs for its preclinical and clinical trial activities performed by Contract Research Organizations CROs and other service providers, as they are incurred, based upon estimates of the work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with associated agreements. The Company uses information it receives from internal personnel and outside service providers to estimate the percentage of completion and therefore the expense to be incurred. 
 We anticipate research and development expenses will increase in the future as we continue to further develop our current lead product candidate, FB102. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees such as legal, auditing, tax and business consulting services, personnel expenses and travel costs, costs associated with being a publicly traded company such as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, accounting fees, and directors and officers liability insurance premiums. Our general and administrative expenses may increase due to increases in professional and advisory fees and as we build out our infrastructure to develop FB102. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net, consists of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents partially offset by taxes and nominal foreign exchange gains and losses. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our critical accounting policies, significant judgments and estimates as disclosed in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 3.0 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of approximately 2.5 million in clinical and other expenses. 
 Research and development expenses were 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 7.5 million in manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase of approximately 4.0 million in clinical and other expenses as we advanced our FB102 program through clinical trials, and a net increase of approximately 1.2 million in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in our average headcount and related costs. 
 We anticipate research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue to further develop our current lead product candidate, FB102. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in legal and professional expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses were 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in legal and professional expenses. 
 Our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future due to increases in professional and advisory fees as we build out our infrastructure to further develop FB102. 
 Other Income, Net 
 The change in other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in the prior year was driven by a decrease in our average cash and cash equivalents. 
 24 

The change in other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by higher interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or out-licenses. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses each year since inception. Our net loss was approximately 28.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 146.8 million. We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 16.4 million as of September 30, 2024. We expect to incur operating losses in the future as we continue to further develop our current lead product candidate, FB102. Given these factors, the Company has concluded that the existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient for the twelve months following the financial statement issuance date, and requires additional liquidity to continue its operations. 
 On July 31, 2023, we issued 606,678 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 25.15 per Share, and 387,566 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of 25.13 per pre-funded warrant ("in the Private Placement"). The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of 0.025 per share of common stock, are immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The gross proceeds of the Private Placement were 25.0 million and we incurred 272 thousand in issuance costs. Certain executive officers, senior management, and board members participated in this Private Placement, purchasing 1.16 million of shares of common stock at a purchase price of 25.25 per share. In connection with the Private Placement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective on September 8, 2023. 
 In June 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that went effective in June 2021 to register the issuance of up to 300 million in securities. On March 31, 2022, we entered into an ATM Facility whereby we may from time to time offer and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 25.0 million during the term of the ATM Facility. On April 1, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement to the June 2021 Form S-3 relating to the offer and sale of shares under the ATM Facility covering sales of up to 7.0 million of shares of common stock. On August 12, 2022, we filed an additional prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of shares for an additional 2.7 million of shares of common stock. However, this shelf registration statement on Form S-3 expired in June 2024, and the Company would need to file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to sell additional shares under the ATM Facility. In addition, as discussed above, we are currently eligible to sell securities under Form S-3 only if and to the extent the aggregate market value of securities sold by us pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 during the twelve-month period immediately prior to, and including, the date of any such sale, does not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3), and we will remain subject to such limitation for so long as the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 75.0 million (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3). As such, while the ATM facility remains in place, Forte remains restricted in its ability to access additional funding from the sale of securities under Form S-3. 
 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 We have not generated any revenue from product sales or from out-licensing. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue. We expect to incur ongoing losses as we continue to further develop our current lead product candidate, FB102, which has potentially broad application for autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, vitiligo, alopecia areata, type 1 diabetes and graft-vs-host disease. FB102 is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 the initiation and progress of preclinical studies and our current and any additional clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the terms and timing of any strategic alliance, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; 

the number of programs we pursue; 

the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals; 

25 

the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; 

the costs involved in patent filing, prosecution, and enforcement; and 

the costs and timing of having clinical supplies of our product candidates manufactured. 

If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any equity or debt financing may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. In addition, our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic, the military conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, recent and any potential future financial institution failures, and otherwise. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to other parties rights to develop or commercialize our drug candidates that we would prefer to retain. 
 See the Risk Factors section on this Form 10-Q for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.

 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 19.7 million and consisted primarily of a net loss of 25.6 million adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation of 2.5 million and decreases in net operating assets of 3.4 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the purchase of property and equipment. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to net proceeds from the redemption of U.S. treasury bills partially offset by their purchase approximately three months earlier. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the tax remittances from RSUs withheld to cover tax obligations on the vesting date offset by proceeds received from employee participation in our ESPP. 
 26 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the net proceeds of 24.8 million received from our Private Placement of 606,678 shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of 25.15 per Share, and 387,566 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of 25.13 per pre-funded warrant.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
 
 Camac Fund L.P. v. Forte Biosciences Inc. , C.A. No. 2022-1075-NAC (Del. Ch.) 
 
 In November 2022, a stockholder of the Company, Camac Fund LP, filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to access certain books and records of the Company pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as well as to seek attorney fees (the Books and Records Action ). The Books and Records Action, which is captioned Camac Fund L.P. v. Forte Biosciences Inc., C.A. No. 2022-1075-NAC, was dismissed with prejudice on July 29, 2024. 
 
 Camac Fund, LP v. Paul A. Wagner, et al. , C.A. No. 2023-0817-MTZ (Del. Ch.) 
 
 On August 10, 2023, Camac Fund LP filed a complaint (the Complaint ), captioned Camac Fund, LP v. Paul A. Wagner, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0817-MTZ, in the Delaware Court of Chancery, against the members of the Company s Board of Directors (the Directors and entities affiliated with certain of the Company s investors (the Investors and naming the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleged that the Directors breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to enter into a July 31, 2023 private placement (the Private Placement ), which raised approximately 25 million for the Company from the Investors and certain of the Company s executives and directors, and by scheduling the Company s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting for more than thirteen months after its 2022 annual meeting. The Complaint also alleged the Investors aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the Directors. Plaintiff also filed a motion for preliminary injunction and motion to expedite seeking a hearing on its preliminary injunction motion on an expedited basis. The Complaint and motions sought declarations that the Directors breached their fiduciary duties and that the Investors aided and abetted them, to enjoin defendants from counting votes cast by the Investors shares obtained through the private placement at the Annual Meeting or any subsequent director election, and money damages in an unspecified amount. 
 On August 15, 2023, the Company, the Directors, and certain Investors filed oppositions to Plaintiff s motion to expedite. On August 16, 2023, the Company, the Directors, and certain Investors filed motions to dismiss the Complaint. On August 17, 2023, the Court held a hearing at which it granted the motion to expedite in part but declined to schedule a preliminary injunction hearing prior to the Annual Meeting and determined that Defendants could brief their motions to dismiss and be heard on an expedited schedule. The Court determined that discovery could proceed while the motions to dismiss are pending and directed the parties to confer regarding a schedule for further proceedings. 
 On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against the Investors. On September 7, 2023, the parties agreed to a schedule for briefing the motion to dismiss filed by the Directors and the Company (together, hereinafter, Defendants ), with the understanding that the schedule would change if Plaintiff amended its Complaint rather than file a brief in opposition to Defendants motion to dismiss, and the parties also agreed to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. On September 19, 2023, the Company held its Annual Meeting at which, among other things, the Company s two director nominees were re-elected and Plaintiff s two director nominees were not elected. On September 21, 2023, Defendants filed their opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss. 
 On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended class action and derivative complaint (the Amended Complaint against the Directors and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The Amended Complaint made many of the same allegations as the original Complaint. The Amended Complaint also purported to bring a claim on behalf of a class of holders of the Company s common stock as of August 10, 2023, the record date for the Annual Meeting. The class claim alleged the Directors breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to enter into the Private Placement, setting the Annual Meeting record date for a date after the Private Placement closed, and holding the Annual Meeting more than thirteen months after the 2022 annual meeting. The Amended Complaint purported to bring a second claim for wrongful dilution derivatively on behalf of the Company. The derivative claim alleged the Directors wrongfully diluted Plaintiff and other stockholders by causing the Company 
 29 

to enter into the Private Placement in bad faith and for the purpose of entrenchment and not permitting Plaintiff and other stockholders to participate. The Amended Complaint sought declarations that the Directors breached their fiduciary duties, that the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the shares acquired in the Private Placement should be excluded from the final voting results, that Plaintiff s two director nominees at the Annual Meeting were elected and that the Company s nominees were not elected, as well as an order requiring Directors to recognize Plaintiff s nominees as validly elected and remove the Company s nominees from their positions on the board of directors. The Amended Complaint also sought an order requiring the Company to hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2024 within thirteen months of the 2023 Annual Meeting, enjoining the shares acquired in the Private Placement from voting at the 2024 annual meeting, and awarding money damages in an unspecified amount. 
 On November 3, 2023, Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint, which was fully briefed in advance of a hearing before the Court on the motion on February 14, 2024. On April 15, 2024, the Court issued an oral ruling denying Defendants motion to dismiss. Expedited discovery ensued. On June 4, 2024, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the action. On June 11, 2024, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release, which was filed with the Court the next day. Also on June 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Standstill and Voting Agreement with Camac Fund LP and related entities and persons. On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Opening Brief in Support of (A) Approval of Settlement; (B) Certification of the Settlement Class; and (C) Award of Attorneys Fees, Litigation Expenses and Incentive Award. In accordance with the terms of the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release the Company paid 364 thousand and accrued 1.7 million for Camac s estimated legal fees which does not include any potential insurance recoveries. The accrual reflected the Company s best estimate based on currently available information at the time. On July 30, 2024, the Court held a settlement hearing and declined to approve the settlement. 
 The Company subsequently took certain actions to moot Camac s claims in the action, as described more fully in the Company s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 20, 2024, which is incorporated by reference. Camac acknowledged that the actions taken by the Company mooted all claims in the action and provided substantial benefits to all stockholders. Camac also repaid to the Company the 364 thousand that the Company had paid for Camac s expenses. In order to fully resolve Camac s claim for an award of attorneys fees, the Company, on behalf of all named defendants in the action, made a payment to Plaintiff s counsel for its fees and expenses in the amount of 1.5 million. On September 18, 2024, the parties filed a Stipulation and Proposed Order Dismissing the Action as Moot (the Mootness Order ), pursuant to which the action would be dismissed with prejudice as to Camac only. On September 20, 2024, the Court entered the Mootness Order. On October 8, 2024, Forte filed an affidavit notifying the Court that, as required by the Mootness Order, it had filed the September 20, 2024 Form 8-K. In accordance with the Mootness Order, the Court subsequently closed the case. 
 Forte Biosciences, Inc. v. Camac Fund, LP, et al. , Case No. 3:23-cv-02399-N (N.D. Tex.) 
 On October 28, 2023, the Company filed a complaint (the Texas Complaint ), captioned Forte Biosciences, Inc. v. Camac Fund, LP, et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-02399-N, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, against Camac Fund, LP, Camac Partners, LLC, Camac Capital, LLC, and Eric Shahinian (collectively, Camac ), as well as against Michael G. Hacke, Chris McIntyre, McIntyre Partnerships, LP, McIntyre Capital GP, LLC, McIntyre Capital Management, LP, McIntyre Capital Management GP, LLC, ATG Fund II LLC, ATG Capital Management, LLC, Gabriel Gliksberg, Funicular Funds, LP, The Funicular Fund, LP, Cable Car Capital LLC, Jacob Ma-Weaver, BML Investment Partners, L.P., BML Capital Management, LLC, and Braden M. Leonard (collectively with Camac, the Texas Defendants ). The Texas Complaint alleged that the Texas Defendants issued false and misleading disclosures in connection with their efforts to elect two directors to Forte s board of directors at the 2023 annual meeting. The Texas Defendants moved to dismiss and on June 11, 2024, the Complaint was dismissed with prejudice. 
 In October 2024, to resolve all claims and potential claims asserted by the parties, the Texas Defendants entered into a settlement agreement and release with Forte, and all Texas Defendants other than Camac entered into standstill and voting agreements that are similar to the agreement Camac entered into in June 2024. 
 Forte Biosciences, Inc. v. Wesco Insurance Co., et al. , Case No. N24C-10-015 VLM CCLD (Del. Super. Ct.) 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company filed a complaint (the Wesco Complaint ), captioned Forte Biosciences, Inc. v. Wesco Insurance Co., et al., Case No. N24C-10-015 VLM CCLD, in the Superior Court of the State of 
 30 

Delaware, against its current and former carriers of Directors Officers liability insurance, Wesco Insurance Company, Beazley Insurance Company, and Palms Insurance Company, Limited (collectively, Insurance Defendants ). The Wesco Complaint brings claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and bad faith, alleging that the Insurance Defendants breached their contractual and legal obligations by refusing to acknowledge and perform their obligation to provide insurance coverage to the Company in connection with: (i) the action captioned Camac Fund, LP v. Paul A. Wagner, et al. , C.A. No. 2023-0817-MTZ (Del. Ch.), described above; (ii) a books and records action brought by Camac in November 2022, which was captioned Camac Fund L.P. v Forte Biosciences Inc. , C.A. No. 2022-1075-NAC (Del. Ch.), described above; and (iii) two books demands for books and records under Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220, made by Camac on August 26, 2022 and August 23, 2023, respectively. The Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that one or more of the Insurance Defendants have an obligation to provide insurance coverage to the Company and the named defendants in the referenced actions, reimbursement and compensatory damages from the Insurance Defendants for breach of contract, and consequential and punitive damages for the Insurance Defendants bad faith coverage positions. 
 
 Item 1A: Ri sk Factors 
 You should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings, in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. 
 Our ability to execute on our business strategy is subject to a number of risks, which are discussed more fully below in this section. You should carefully consider these risks before making an investment in our common stock. These risks include, among others, the following: 
 Forte s current liquidity position and recurring losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing. 

Forte will require additional capital to fund its operations and if Forte fails to obtain necessary financing, Forte will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of its current lead product candidate, FB102, or any future product candidates. 

Forte s business is almost entirely dependent on the success of developing FB102, which may not be successful. 

Results from early preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of results from later stage studies or clinical trials. 

Forte has no approved products and has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate its technology and product development capabilities and predict its future performance. 

Forte has incurred net losses in every year since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses in the future. 

Forte s ability to successfully develop any product candidate is highly uncertain. 

Clinical development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. Forte may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidate. 

Forte s planned preclinical studies, current clinical trials or future clinical trials or those of its future collaborators may reveal significant adverse events and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of its product candidates. 

31 

Positive results from early preclinical studies and current clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results of any future clinical trials of product candidates. Forte may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any product candidates. 

Interim top-line and preliminary data from future clinical trials that Forte announces or publishes from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 

The market opportunities for FB102 may be limited and Forte s estimates of the incidence and prevalence of its target patient populations may be inaccurate. 

Forte is very early in its development efforts. FB102 will require significant additional clinical development before Forte seeks regulatory approval of any product candidate. If Forte is unable to advance FB102 to clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize a product candidate or experiences significant delays in doing so, its business will be materially harmed. 

If Forte is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any product candidate Forte develops, its competitors could develop and commercialize products or technology similar or identical to Forte s, and its ability to successfully commercialize any product candidate Forte may develop, and its technology, may be adversely affected. 

Forte expects to rely on third parties to conduct its preclinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture its product candidates. 

Forte was previously non-compliant with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement and should Forte not be compliant in the future, that could result in the delisting of our common stock and limit investor s ability to trade in our common stock. 

The market price of Forte s common stock is expected to be volatile. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Litigation has arisen, and more could arise, in connection with the Private Placement, which could be costly, divert management s attention and otherwise materially harm our business. 

Forte previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the review of the annual income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 which had been prepared by a third-party accounting firm that has since been remediated. If Forte experiences material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 

A variety of risks associated with public health threats and epidemics, including any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the emergence of another public health emergency could materially adversely affect Forte s business. 

Risks related to Forte s business, technology and industry 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder Forte s ability to obtain further financing. Any capital-raising transaction Forte is able to complete may result in substantial dilution to its existing stockholders. 
 Based on the Forte s current financial position and business plan, it has determined that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund Forte s planned operations for at least twelve months from the date hereof and that Forte s current liquidity position, recurring net losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Forte s ability to continue 
 32 

as a going concern will depend on its ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. There is no guarantee that investors or other financing sources will be willing to provide additional funding to Forte on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any capital-raising transaction Forte is able to complete may result in substantial dilution to its existing shareholders, require it to relinquish significant rights, or restrict its operation. 
 Forte will require additional capital to fund its operations and if Forte fails to obtain necessary financing, Forte will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of its current lead product candidate, FB102, or any future product candidates. 
 Forte s operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. Forte expects to continue to spend substantial amounts to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials of its current and future programs, to validate the manufacturing process and specifications for its product candidate, to seek regulatory approvals for its product candidate and to launch and commercialize any products for which Forte receives regulatory approval, including potentially building its own commercial organization. As of September 30, 2024, Forte had approximately 16.4 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on its current operating plan, Forte believes that its current cash available will not enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least twelve months from the issuance date of this Form 10-Q. Future capital requirements and the period for which its existing resources will support its operations may vary significantly from what Forte currently expects, and Forte will require additional capital in order to complete the clinical development of FB102. Forte s monthly spending levels will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with development of FB102 and any future product candidates is highly uncertain, Forte is unable to estimate the actual funds it will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Forte s future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for FB102 and any future product candidates and any need to conduct additional such studies as may be required by a regulator; 

the clinical development plans Forte establishes for FB102 and any future product candidates; 

the terms of any collaboration agreements Forte may choose to initiate or conclude; 

the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

delay or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators or institutional review boards IRBs in order to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or their suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced; 

failure of third-party contractors, such as contract research organizations CROs ), or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements, including Good Clinical Practice GCP 

governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulation or policy relating to the development and commercialization of its product candidate by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

undertaking and completing additional preclinical studies to generate data required to support the continued clinical development of a product candidate; 

inability to enroll sufficient patients to complete a protocol; 

difficulty in having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

problems with biopharmaceutical product candidate storage, stability and distribution; 

its inability to add new or additional clinical trial sites; 

varying interpretations of the data generated from its preclinical or clinical trials; 

33 

Forte s inability to manufacture, or obtain from third parties, adequate supply of biopharmaceutical product candidate sufficient to complete its preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the costs of establishing, maintaining, and overseeing a quality system compliant with current good manufacturing practice requirements cGMPs and a supply chain for the development and manufacture of its product candidate; 

the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against Forte, FB102; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the cost and timing of establishing, expanding and scaling manufacturing capabilities; 

the effect of potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from a potential resurgence of the COVID 19 pandemic, the military conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, recent and any potential future financial institution failures, and otherwise; 

the effect of inflationary pressure on the United States capital markets and our ability to raise capital, including any impact of adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as those based on liquidity constraints or concerns; 

the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidate for which Forte may receive regulatory approval in regions where Forte chooses to commercialize its products on its own; and 

potential unforeseen business disruptions or market fluctuations that delay its product development or clinical trials and increase its costs or expenses, such as business or operational disruptions, delays, or system failures due to malware, unauthorized access, terrorism, war, natural disasters, strikes, geopolitical conflicts, restrictions on trade, import or export restrictions, or public health crises. 

In June 2021, Forte filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that went effective in June 2021 to register the issuance of up to 300 million in securities. On March 31, 2022, Forte entered into an ATM Facility whereby Forte may from time to time offer and sell shares of its common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 25.0 million during the term of the ATM Facility. On April 1, 2022, Forte filed a prospectus supplement to the June 2021 Form S-3 for the offer and sale of the shares under the ATM Facility covering sales of up to 7.0 million of shares of common stock. On August 12, 2022, Forte filed an additional prospectus supplement relating to offer and sell an additional 2.7 million of shares of common stock. However, this shelf registration statement on Form S-3 expired in June 2024, and the Company would need to file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to sell additional shares under the ATM Facility. In addition, Forte is currently eligible to sell securities under Form S-3 only if and to the extent the aggregate market value of securities sold by Forte pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 during the twelve-month period immediately prior to, and including, the date of any such sale, does not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of Forte s common stock held by non-affiliates (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3), and Forte will remain subject to such limitation for so long as the aggregate market value of Forte s common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 75 million (as determined by General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3). As such, while the ATM Facility remains in place, Forte remains restricted in its ability to access additional funding from the sale of securities under Form S-3. 
 In addition, in July 2023, the Company completed the Private Placement financing pursuant to which the Company sold (i) 606,678 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 387,566 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase Common Stock at a purchase price of 25.13 per Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of 0.025 per share of Common Stock, were immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The gross proceeds of the Private Placement were approximately 25 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by the Company. While the proceeds from the Private Placement provided further funding for the Company s operations, the Company will still require additional capital to fund its operations and complete the development and commercialization of FB102 or any future product candidates. 
 Forte does not have any committed external source of funds or other support for its development efforts, and Forte cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Until Forte can generate sufficient product or royalty revenue to finance its cash requirements, which Forte may never do, Forte 
 34 

expects to finance its future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements. If Forte raises additional funds through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect its stockholders rights. Further, to the extent that Forte raises additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, each existing investors ownership interest will be diluted. If Forte raises additional capital through debt financing, Forte would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting its ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or acquiring or licensing intellectual property rights. If Forte raises additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, Forte may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to its product candidate, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to it. Forte also could be required to seek collaborators for one or more of its current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish its rights to product candidates or technologies that Forte otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize itself. In addition, our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the military conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the effect of inflationary pressure on the United States capital markets, adverse developments affecting the financial services industry (such as the closure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 and any similar bank closures) and otherwise. If Forte is unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to it, Forte may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of its current product candidate, FB102, or one or more of its other current or future research and development initiatives. Any of the above events could significantly harm its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of its common stock to decline. 
 Forte s business through 2021 had been almost entirely dependent on the success of FB-401 and Forte subsequently decided to discontinue the advancement of FB-401. In 2022, Forte decided to devote significant time and resources to developing FB102, which may not be successful. 
 Through 2021, Forte invested substantially all of its efforts and financial resources into the research and development of FB-401, which was its only product candidate to enter clinical trials. In September 2021, Forte announced that it would not be continuing the advancement of FB-401. 
 Following the announcement of the FB-401 trial results, the Company ceased further development of FB-401 and conducted an extensive process to evaluate strategic alternatives. Following such process, the Company determined to focus on developing its FB102 program, and recently completed a healthy volunteer trial for FB102. The Company plans to continue development of FB102 and initiated a patient-based trial in the third quarter of 2024. We will be required to devote significant time and resources to developing FB102, which may not be successful. 
 Results from early-preclinical and clinical studies may not be predictive of results from later-stage studies or clinical trials. 
 We are still early in our testing of FB102, and FB102 is our only product candidate in clinical development. While initial preclinical data demonstrated positive activity, additional clinical studies may produce negative or inconclusive results. The FDA or a non-US regulatory authority may require us to conduct additional testing. Success of FB102 in early preclinical studies does not mean that future clinical trials will be successful. In addition, preclinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies whose product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Any of these events could limit the commercial potential of our product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 35 

Forte s prospects are highly dependent on a single product candidate, FB102. If we are unable to complete further development of, obtain approval for and commercialize FB102 for one or more indications in a timely manner, our business will be harmed. 
 Forte s long-term prospects are highly dependent on future acceptance and revenues from a single product, FB102. FB102 is our only product candidate at this time. Forte recently completed a healthy volunteer trial for FB102 and subsequently initiated a patient-based trial for FB102 in the third quarter of 2024. Any further development of FB102 would require substantial capital and time to complete and there is no guarantee that any future clinical trial, if pursued, would be timely or successful, or that FB102 will be approved or, if approved, that commercialization would be successful. 
 Forte has no approved products and has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate its technology and product development capabilities and predict its future performance. 
 We are very early in our development efforts of FB102 and, prior to discontinuing the advancement of FB-401, were early in our clinical development efforts of FB-401. 
 Prior to the closing of the Merger, Forte s predecessor company was formed in 2017 as a privately held company. Forte has no products approved for commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from product sales. Forte s ability to generate product revenue or profits was dependent on the successful development and eventual commercialization of FB-401 prior to Forte s decision to discontinue development of FB-401 and, following Forte s decision to focus on development of FB102, Forte s prospects are currently highly dependent on Forte s ability to successfully develop FB102. Given the early stage of FB102, which recently completed a healthy volunteer trial, and the highly uncertain nature of early-stage drug development, Forte may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product. 
 Forte s current and future programs and product candidates will require additional discovery research, preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval to commercialize the product, manufacturing validation, obtaining manufacturing supply, capacity and expertise, building of a commercial and distribution organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before Forte generates any revenue from product sales. In addition, any drug product candidate must be approved for marketing by the FDA or certain other health regulatory agencies before Forte may commercialize any product in the respective jurisdictions. 
 Forte s limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate its, or any new, technology and industry and predict its future performance. Forte s short history as an operating company makes any assessment of its future success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. Forte will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in evolving fields, for example the failure of the FB-401 trial. If Forte does not address these risks successfully, its business will suffer. Similarly, Forte expects that its financial condition and operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. As a result, its stockholders should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual period as an indicator of future operating performance. 
 Forte has incurred net losses in every year since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses in the future. 
 Forte is a clinical-stage healthcare company with a limited operating history. Investment in product development in the healthcare industry, including of biopharmaceutical products, is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. Forte s current lead product candidate, FB102, is currently in clinical development. Forte has no products approved for commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and Forte will continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to its ongoing operations. As a result, Forte is not profitable and has incurred losses in each year since its inception in 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Forte reported a net loss of approximately 28.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, Forte had 
 36 

an accumulated deficit of 146.8 million. Forte expects to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and Forte expects these losses to increase as Forte continues its research and development of, and seeks regulatory approvals for, its current lead product candidate, FB102, and any future product candidates Forte may seek to develop. Forte anticipates that its expenses will increase substantially if, and as, it: 
 conducts additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for FB102 and any future product candidates; 

continues to discover and develop additional applications for FB102 and any future product candidates; 

maintains, expands and protects its intellectual property portfolio; 

hires or contracts additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing and commercial personnel to support its product development and commercialization efforts; 

validates a manufacturing process and specifications for FB102 and any future product candidates; 

establishes in-house manufacturing capabilities; 

establishes a commercial manufacturing source and secures supply chain capacity sufficient to provide clinical trial material and commercial quantities of any product candidate for which Forte may obtain regulatory approval; 

acquires or in-licenses other product candidates and technologies; 

seeks various regulatory approvals; 

establishes a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which Forte may obtain regulatory approval; and 

adds operational, compliance, financial and management information systems and personnel to support being a public company. 

To become and remain profitable, Forte or any potential future collaborator must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential at an adequate profit margin after cost of goods sold and other expenses. This will require Forte to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approval for FB102 or any future product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling products for which Forte may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. Forte may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if Forte does, Forte may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability. If Forte does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Forte s failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair its ability to raise capital, maintain its research and development efforts, expand its business or continue its operations. 
 Even if Forte succeeds in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing its current product candidate, FB102, Forte may continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional applications for its current product candidate or any future product candidates. Forte may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect its business. The size of its future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of its expenses and its ability to generate revenue. Forte s prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on its stockholders equity and working capital. 
 Forte s ability to successfully develop any product candidate is highly uncertain. 
 Forte s ability to successfully develop FB102 or any other future product candidate is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond Forte s control. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons, including: 
 preclinical study or clinical trial results may show the product candidate to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects or toxicities; 

clinical trial results may show the product candidate to be less effective than expected (e.g., a clinical trial could fail to meet its primary endpoint(s)) or to have unacceptable side effects or toxicities; 

37 

failure to execute the clinical trials caused by slow enrollment in clinical trials, patients dropping out of clinical trials, length of time to achieve clinical trial endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis, inability to validate the manufacturing process or to achieve cGMP compliance for the product candidate or inability to identify a suitable bioanalytical assay method agreeable to applicable regulators; 

failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals, delays in preparation responding to an FDA request for additional clinical data or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues; 

manufacturing costs, formulation issues, manufacturing deficiencies or other factors that that make FB102 or any future product candidate uneconomical; and 

proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent FB102 or any future product candidate from being commercialized. 

The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval of a drug product candidate for a final decision by a regulatory authority may be difficult to predict for FB102 or any future product candidate, in large part because of its limited regulatory history. 
 Even if Forte is successful in obtaining market approval for a drug product, commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on marketing acceptance, the availability of insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and managed care organizations, which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. Various industry stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have initiated lawsuits against the federal government asserting that the price negotiation provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional. The impact of these judicial challenges as well as legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the government on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. 
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, FDA recently authorized the state of Florida to import certain prescription drugs from Canada for a period of two years to help reduce drug costs, provided that Florida s Agency for Health Care Administration meets the requirements set forth by the FDA. Other states may follow Florida. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a reduction in payments from private payors. Third-party payors could require Forte to conduct additional studies, including post-marketing studies related to the cost-effectiveness of the product, to qualify for reimbursement, which could be costly and divert its resources. If government and other healthcare payors were not to provide adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement levels for any of its drug products once approved, market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced. 
 In addition, if any of Forte s drug product candidates, including FB102, are approved for marketing, Forte will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration. If approved, any of its drug products would be subject to restrictions on its products labels and other conditions of regulatory approval that may limit its ability to market its products. Forte will also need to comply (and ensure that its third-party contractors comply) with cGMPs, and Good Clinical 
 38 

Practice GCP ), as Forte (and its third-party contractors) will be required to comply with these requirements for the products or product candidates used in its clinical trials or post-approval studies. In addition, Forte will need to comply with GCPs for any clinical trial conducted for any therapeutic indications Forte may develop for approval. In addition, there is always the risk that Forte or a regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a drug product post-approval, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency. Compliance with these requirements and other regulatory requirements is costly and any failure to comply or other issues with its product post-approval could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Clinical development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. Forte may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidate. 
 To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, Forte must demonstrate through extensive clinical trials that its product candidate is safe and effective in humans for its intended use. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. As seen with the FB-401 trial, Forte may be unable to establish clinical endpoints, dose levels and regimens or bioanalytical assay methods that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful, and a clinical trial can fail at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of these studies or trials do not necessarily predict final results. Differences in trial design between early-stage clinical trials and later-stage clinical trials make it difficult to extrapolate the results of earlier clinical trials to later clinical trials. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidate performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidate. 
 Successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a BLA to the FDA, and similar marketing applications to comparable foreign regulatory authorities, for each product candidate, and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any product candidate. 
 Forte may experience delays in initiating or completing any future clinical trials. Forte also may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any future clinical trials that Forte could conduct that could delay or prevent its ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize its product candidate, including: 
 regulators or IRBs, or ethics committees may not authorize Forte or its investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 

Forte may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; 

clinical trials of any product candidate may fail to show safety, purity or potency, or produce negative or inconclusive results and Forte may decide, or regulators may require it, to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or Forte may decide to abandon product development programs; 

the number of patients required for clinical trials of any product candidate may be larger than Forte anticipates, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than Forte anticipates, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than Forte anticipates; 

clinical trials of its product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and Forte may decide, or regulators may require it, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; 

regulators may require Forte to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or Forte may be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval; 

39 

regulators may revise the requirements for approving its product candidates, or such requirements may not be as Forte anticipate; 

Forte s third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to it in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of the trial, which may require that Forte add new clinical trial sites or investigators; 

the cost of clinical trials of its product candidates may be more than Forte anticipates or more than its available financial resources, and Forte may need to delay or suspend one or more trials until Forte completes additional financing transactions or otherwise receives adequate funding; 

the supply or quality of Forte s product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of its product candidate may be insufficient or inadequate and may not achieve compliance with applicable cGMPs; 

Forte s product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing it or its investigators, regulators or IRBs or ethics committees to suspend or terminate clinical trials, or reports may arise from clinical testing of its product candidate that raise safety or efficacy concerns about its product candidate; 

clinical trials of Forte s product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may result in it deciding, or regulators requiring it, to conduct additional clinical trials or suspend or terminate its clinical trials; 

the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of its clinical trials, or require Forte to submit additional data such as long-term toxicology studies or impose other requirements before permitting it to initiate a clinical trial; 

regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution; 

Forte s limited experience in filing and pursuing a BLA necessary to gain regulatory approval; 

any failure to develop substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, and to develop quality standards and manufacturing processes to demonstrate consistent safety, purity, identity, and/or potency standards; 

a decision by Forte, IRBs, or regulators to suspend or terminate its clinical trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

regulatory inspections of its clinical trials, clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require Forte to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate its clinical trials if regulators find it not to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements; 

Forte s ability to produce sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete its clinical trials; 

varying interpretations of the data generated from its clinical trials; and 

changes in governmental regulations or administrative action. 

Forte could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated for any reason. A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or its clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment, failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of its product candidate. Further, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with its clinical trial design and its 
 40 

interpretation of data from clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for its clinical trials. 
 Forte s product development costs will increase if it experiences delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals. Forte does not know whether any of its clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which Forte may have the exclusive right to commercialize its product candidate and may allow its competitors to bring products to market before Forte does, potentially impairing its ability to successfully commercialize its product candidate upon approval and harming its business and results of operations. Any delays in its future clinical development programs may harm its business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 Forte s planned additional preclinical studies or current and future clinical trials or those of its future collaborators may reveal significant adverse events and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of its product candidates. 
 Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, Forte must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that FB102 is both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the preclinical or clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies as well as early clinical trials of a product candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. In addition, initial success in clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when such clinical trials are completed. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidate proceeding through clinical trials. 
 Forte s FB102 may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile. A number of companies in the healthcare industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy and/or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of its future clinical trials would be successful or support further clinical development of any product candidates. 
 If significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of its current or potential future preclinical studies or clinical trials, Forte may have difficulty recruiting patients to its clinical trials, patients may drop out of such trials or Forte may be required to significantly redesign or terminate trials or its development efforts of one or more product candidates altogether. Forte, the FDA, or other applicable regulatory authorities or an IRB may suspend or terminate clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that patients in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the healthcare industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage clinical trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm Forte s business, financial condition and prospects. 
 Positive results from early preclinical studies are not necessarily predictive of the results of any current or future clinical trials of product candidates. Forte may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any product candidates. 
 Any positive results from its preclinical studies and clinical trials of any product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results from required later clinical trials. Similarly, even if Forte is able to complete its current patient-based trial and any future clinical trials of FB102 or any other product candidates according to its current development timeline, the positive results from such clinical trial or future clinical trials may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trial results. 
 41 

Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and Forte cannot be certain that it will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings, or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidate performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or similar regulatory approval. 
 Interim top-line and preliminary data from current and future clinical trials that Forte announces or publishes from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 From time to time, Forte may publish interim top-line or preliminary data from its clinical trials. Interim data from these clinical trials that Forte may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data Forte previously published. As a result, any such interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm its business prospects. 
 If Forte fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, Forte could become subject to significant fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of its business. 
 Forte is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. Forte generally contracts with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. Forte cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of its commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although Forte believes that the safety procedures utilized by its third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, Forte cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, Forte may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed its resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail its use of certain materials and/or interrupt its business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. Forte cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of its future compliance. In addition, Forte may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair its research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 Although Forte maintain workers compensation insurance to cover it for costs and expenses Forte may incur due to injuries to its employees resulting from the use of biological waste or hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Forte does not carry specific biological waste or hazardous waste insurance coverage, workers compensation or property and casualty and general liability insurance policies that include coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. 
 42 

The market opportunities for FB102 may be limited and Forte s estimates of the incidence and prevalence of its target patient populations may be inaccurate. 
 Forte s projections of both the number of people who have the diseases Forte is targeting, as well as the subset of people with these diseases in a position to receive its therapies, if approved, are based on its beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, input from key opinion leaders, patient foundations or secondary market research databases, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases or regulatory approvals may include limitations for use or contraindications that decrease the addressable patient population. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for its product candidate may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with its product candidate. Even if Forte obtains significant market share for its product candidate, because certain of the potential target populations are small, Forte may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications. 
 Forte faces significant competition from other healthcare companies, and its operating results will suffer if Forte fails to compete effectively. 
 The healthcare industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Forte s competitors may be able to develop other compounds or products that are able to achieve similar or better results. Forte s potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of its competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff, experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel therapeutics or to in-license novel therapeutics that could make any product candidate that Forte develops obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry may result in even more resources being concentrated amongst its competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Forte s competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing therapies that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than FB102 or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that Forte may need for the development of potential technologies and products. Forte believes the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of its product candidate are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, convenience of use, compliance with regulatory requirements, acceptance by patients or prescribers, competitive pricing and reimbursement. 
 Forte anticipates competing with the largest healthcare companies in the world, many of which have greater financial, human, and manufacturing resources than Forte currently has. In addition to these fully integrated healthcare companies, Forte will also compete with those companies whose products target the same indications as FB102 or any future product candidate Forte develops. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. Any treatments developed by its competitors could be superior to any product candidates Forte develops. It is possible that these competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than Forte s potential products or that would render any of Forte s product candidate obsolete or noncompetitive. Forte anticipates that it will face increased competition in the future as additional companies enter its market and scientific developments surrounding competing therapies continue to accelerate. 
 Even if FB102 or any other product candidate that Forte develops receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, consumers and others in the medical or healthcare community necessary for commercial success. 
 If FB102 or any other future product candidate Forte develops receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, consumers and 
 43 

others in the medical community. If any such product candidate Forte develops does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, Forte may not generate significant product revenues and Forte may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any of Forte s product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments; 

the labeled uses or limitations for use, including age limitations or contraindications, for its product candidate compared to alternative treatments; 

convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; 

the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

public perception of new therapies; 

the strength of marketing and distribution support; 

the ability to offer its products, if approved, for sale at competitive prices; 

the ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; and 

the prevalence and severity of any side effects. 

Forte s operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by the public health emergencies or other disruptions to the industry. 
 While the extent of the impact of public health outbreaks on Forte s business and financial results is uncertain, including indirect impact via third parties Forte contracts with, a continued and prolonged public health crisis could have a negative impact on its business, financial condition and operating results. To the extent any global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impact operations in the United States, its clinical studies could be slowed or delayed, or in a more severe scenario, its business, financial condition and operating results could be more severely affected. 
 Forte will need to grow the size of its organization, and may experience difficulties in managing this growth. 
 As of November 8, 2024, Forte had 11 full-time employees. As its research, development, manufacturing and commercialization plans and strategies develop to focus on the development of FB102 and any future product candidates, Forte expects to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: 
 identifying, recruiting, compensating, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees; 

managing its internal research and development efforts effectively, including identifying clinical candidates, scaling its manufacturing process and navigating the clinical and FDA review process for its product candidate; and 

improving its operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. 

Forte s future financial performance and its ability to commercialize FB102 or any future product candidate will depend, in part, on its ability to effectively manage any future growth, and its management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. 
 Forte currently relies, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including many aspects of regulatory affairs, clinical management and manufacturing. There can be no assurance that the services of these organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to Forte on a timely basis when needed or that Forte can find qualified replacements. In addition, if Forte is unable to effectively manage its outsourced activities or if the quality or 
 44 

accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, its preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and Forte may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of FB102 or any other future product candidate or otherwise advance its business. There can be no assurance that Forte will be able to manage its existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. 
 If Forte is not able to effectively expand its organization by hiring new employees and expanding its groups of consultants and contractors, Forte may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize any product candidate and, accordingly, may not achieve its research, development and commercialization goals. 
 Forte s current operations are located in Texas, and Forte or the third parties upon whom Forte depends may be adversely affected by natural disasters or the resurgence of the COVID-19 outbreak or other pandemics, and its business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect Forte from a serious disaster. 
 Forte s current operations are located in Texas. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, tornado, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in it being unable to fully utilize its facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of its third-party contract manufacturers, may have a material and adverse effect on its ability to operate its business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on its financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of its product candidate or interruption of its business operations. Any natural disasters could further disrupt its operations and have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented it from using all or a significant portion of its headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as its research facilities or the manufacturing facilities of its third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for Forte to continue its business for a substantial period of time. As part of its risk management policy, Forte maintains insurance coverage at levels that Forte believes are appropriate for its business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, Forte cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If its facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of its third-party contract manufacturers, are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of its research and development programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 If Forte loses key management personnel, or if Forte fails to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, its ability to identify and develop new or next generation product candidate will be impaired, could result in loss of markets or market share and could make Forte less competitive. 
 Forte s ability to compete in the highly competitive healthcare industry depends upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. Forte is highly dependent on its management, scientific and medical personnel, including Paul Wagner, Ph.D. The loss of the services of any of its executive officers, other key employees, and other scientific and medical advisors, and its inability to find suitable replacements could result in delays in product development and harm its business. 
 To retain valuable employees in a competitive market, in addition to salary and cash incentives, Forte has provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of equity awards that vest over time may be significantly affected by decreases in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. We may face challenges in retaining and recruiting such individuals due to sustained declines in our stock price that could reduce the retention value of equity awards as well as concerns related to the risk of our ability to continue as a going concern. Despite its efforts to retain valuable employees, members of its management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with Forte on short notice. Employment of its key employees is at-will, which means that any of its employees could 
 45 

leave its employment at any time, with or without notice. Forte does not maintain key man insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of its other employees. Forte s success also depends on its ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel. 
 Forte s internal computer systems, or those used by its CROs, CMOs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches. 
 Despite the implementation of security measures, Forte s internal computer systems and those of its future CROs, CMOs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. While Forte has not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of its development programs and its business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, its data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, Forte could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of product candidates could be delayed. 
 Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in 2016, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company that collects and uses personal data in connection with offering goods or services to individuals in the European Union or the monitoring of their behavior. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 20 million or 4 of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase the cost of providing its product candidate, if approved, or even prevent Forte from offering any product candidate, if approved, in certain jurisdictions. 
 Forte s employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors acting on its behalf may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements. 
 Forte is exposed to the risks of employee fraud or other illegal activity by its employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors acting on its behalf. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails to comply with the laws of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, comply with manufacturing standards Forte has established, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. If Forte obtains FDA approval of any product candidate and begin commercializing such product in the United States, its potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and its costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. These laws may impact, among other things, its current activities with principal investigators and research patients, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. 
 Manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products and their facilities, vendors and suppliers are subject to continual review and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as to the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Furthermore, its manufacturing facilities must be approved by regulatory agencies before these facilities can be used to manufacture its products or product candidates, and they will also be subject to additional regulatory inspections. Any material changes Forte may make to its manufacturing process or to the components used in its products may require additional prior approval by the FDA and state or foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. 
 46 

A variety of risks associated with testing and developing a product candidate internationally could materially adversely affect Forte s business. 
 Forte may seek regulatory approval of its product candidate outside of the United States and, if so, Forte expects that it will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if Forte obtains the necessary approvals, including: 
 differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries; 

unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, import or export controls, and other regulatory requirements; 

economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; 

foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 

foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; 

difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations; 

workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), or comparable foreign regulations; 

challenges enforcing its contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; 

production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and 

business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war, terrorism and public health crises, such as COVID-19 and its variants. 

These and other risks associated with its international operations may materially adversely affect its ability to attain or maintain profitable operations. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of a product candidate in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that Forte will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the product, manufacturing, and in many cases reimbursement of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In some cases, the price that Forte intends to charge for its products is also subject to approval by regulatory authorities. If Forte fails to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, its target market will be reduced and its ability to realize the full market potential of a product candidate will be harmed. 
 Forte currently has no marketing and sales organization and has no experience in marketing products. If Forte is unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidate, Forte may not be able to generate product revenue. 
 Forte currently has no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and has no experience in marketing products. If and when Forte reaches the commercialization stage, Forte intends to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. Forte will have to compete with other healthcare companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. 
 47 

There can be no assurance that Forte would be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas. 
 Comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect Forte s business and financial condition. 
 Recent changes to U.S. tax laws, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of Forte s business and financial condition. For example, on December 22, 2017, former President Trump signed into law the Tax Act, that significantly reformed the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including changes to U.S. federal tax rates, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, and the modification and repeal of many business deductions and credits (including the reduction of the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as orphan drugs ). There could be additional changes to existing tax law, including an increase in the corporate and other tax rates. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently considered changes to existing tax law that could adversely affect Forte s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Forte s ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income or tax liability may be subject to certain limitations. 
 As of December 31, 2023, Forte has federal net operating loss carryforwards of 27.2 million, which begin expiring in 2037 and state net operating loss carryforwards of 11.6 million that begin to expire in 2037, unless utilized. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities, respectively. In addition, in general, under Sections 382, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5 of a corporation s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Forte s existing NOL carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if Forte undergo an ownership change in connection with or after the Merger, its ability to utilize NOL carryforwards could be further limited by Section 382. In addition, future changes in its stock ownership, many of which are outside of its control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382. Forte s NOL carryforwards may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, Forte may not be able to utilize a material portion of its NOL carryforwards. Furthermore, its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards is conditioned upon its attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. As described above, Forte has incurred significant net losses since its inception and anticipates that Forte will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; and therefore, Forte does not know whether or when Forte will generate the U.S. federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize its NOL carryforwards that are subject to limitation by Sections 382. 
 Unstable market and economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, may have serious adverse consequences on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. 
 As widely reported, global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Forte s general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require Forte 
 48 

to delay or abandon preclinical and clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of its current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect its ability to attain its operating goals on schedule and on budget. Furthermore, its stock price may decline due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn. 
 In particular, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations. The U.S. government has made and continues to make significant additional changes in U.S. trade policy and may continue to take future actions that could negatively impact U.S. trade. For example, legislation has been introduced in Congress to limit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by select Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing executive branch authorities to limit those Chinese service providers ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. If we are unable to obtain or use services from existing service providers or become unable to export or sell our products to any of our customers or service providers, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition, actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. 
 Although we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial institutions with which we have arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we have financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. 
 In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Risks related to government regulation 
 Forte is very early in its development efforts. FB102 will require significant additional preclinical and clinical development before Forte seeks regulatory approval of any product candidate. If Forte is unable to advance FB102 to clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize a product candidate or experiences significant delays in doing so, its business will be materially harmed. 
 Forte is very early in its development efforts and will invest substantially all of its efforts and financial resources in the development of FB102. Its ability to generate product revenues, which Forte does not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of a 
 49 

product candidate, which may never occur. Forte currently generates no revenue from sales of any products, and Forte may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product. The success of FB102 will depend on several factors, including the following: 
 successful completion of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for FB102; 

establishing cGMP-compliant clinical supply and commercial manufacturing operations or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing; 

obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for FB102; 

launching commercial sales of FB102, if and when approved or allowed for marketing, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

acceptance of FB102, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 

obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims; 

the marketing of FB102; and 

maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of FB102 following approval or commercialization. 

If Forte does not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, Forte could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize FB102, which would materially harm its business. If Forte does not receive regulatory approvals for FB102, it may not be able to continue its operations. 
 Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit Forte s future business activities, increase its operating or regulatory costs, reduce demand for product candidates or result in litigation. 
 The conduct of Forte s business, including the development, testing, production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which its products candidates and components thereof (such as packaging) may be manufactured or sold. 
 These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: 
 FDA regulations; 

laws related to product candidate labeling; 

advertising and marketing laws and practices; 

laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain products; 

increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the actual or possible effects or side effects of its product candidate; and 

state and federal consumer protection and disclosure laws. 

New laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, may alter the environment in which Forte does business and, therefore, may impact its operating results or increase its costs or liabilities. 
 Inadequate funding for or other disruptions to the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including due to public health concerns, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, 
 50 

prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the approval of Forte s product candidates rely, which would negatively impact its business. 
 The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which its operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
 If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, including due to government furloughs, budget constraints , travel restrictions, staffing shortages, or if global health or other concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities in a timely manner, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process its regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, including its ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue its operations. 
 Forte s relationships with healthcare providers, including physicians and clinical investigators, CROs, and third-party payors in connection with its current and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose Forte to significant losses, including, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from federal health care programs, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings. 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the research, promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations laws that may affect Forte s ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can constitute a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act FCA ). The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and a referral source on the other, including prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be 

51 

presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery; 

HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it; 

HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 

the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program with specific exceptions to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and 

GDPR and other ex-U.S. protections. 

52 

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations or inquiries by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company s attention from the business. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects entities to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of its operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if Forte becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical manufacturer to incur significant legal expenses and divert management s attention from the operation of the business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way. 
 Forte maintains a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions Forte takes to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting Forte from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that its business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that its business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and Forte is not successful in defending ourselves or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on its business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of its operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business and its results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of its product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject Forte to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of any of its product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that Forte will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for its product candidate in other jurisdictions. 
 Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval does not guarantee that Forte will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that Forte intends to charge for its products may also be subject to approval. 
 53 

Forte may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of a product candidate with which Forte must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for Forte and could delay or prevent the introduction of its products in certain countries. If Forte fails to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, its target market will be reduced and its ability to realize the full market potential of its product candidate will be harmed. 
 Preclinical and clinical development is uncertain. Forte s preclinical studies and clinical trials may experience delays or may never advance to the next stage of development, which would adversely affect its ability to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize these programs on a timely basis or at all, which would have an adverse effect on its business. 
 To proceed with its development plans and ultimately commercialization of FB102, Forte will be required to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Forte cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of its preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept its proposed clinical programs, including the design, dose level, and dose regimen, or if the outcome of its preclinical testing and studies will ultimately support the development of its clinical programs. 
 If Forte is not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals for any product candidates it may develop, Forte will not be able to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, such product candidates, and its ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. 
 Any product candidate Forte may develop and the activities associated with the development and commercialization of such product candidate, including its design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Before Forte can commercialize any product candidate, Forte must obtain marketing approval. Forte has never received approval to market any product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and it is possible that no product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval. Forte, as a company, has no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expects to rely on third-party CROs and/or regulatory consultants to assist it in this process. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate s safety, efficacy, purity, and potency. 
 Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the drug manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Any product candidate Forte develops may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude it from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. 
 The process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted IND/BLA, or equivalent application types, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that its data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. Any product candidate 
 54 

Forte seeks to develop could be delayed in receiving, or fail to receive, regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following: 
 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, including study population, dose level, dose regimen, endpoint measure of efficacy, and bioanalytical assay methods, or implementation of its clinical trials; 

Forte may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that its product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication; 

the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval; 

Forte may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with its interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the data collected from clinical trials of its product candidate may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 

the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which Forte contracts for clinical and commercial supplies; and 

the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering its clinical data insufficient for approval. 

Of the large number of biopharmaceutical products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in Forte failing to obtain regulatory approval to market its product candidate, which would significantly harm its business, results of operations and prospects. 
 The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support approval. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on its ability to obtain approval of any product candidate that Forte develops based on the completed clinical trials. 
 In addition, even if Forte were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve its product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than Forte requests, may include limitations for use or contraindications that limit the suitable patient population, may not approve the price Forte intends to charge for its products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for any product candidate Forte develops. 
 If Forte experiences delays in obtaining approval or if Forte fails to obtain approval of any product candidate it seeks to develop, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed, and its ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 
 Forte s product candidate, FB102, or any future product candidate Forte develops, may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. 
 Undesirable side effects caused by any of its product candidates could cause Forte to interrupt, delay or halt additional preclinical studies or could cause Forte or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive clinical label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other

regulatory authorities for its product candidate. Results of its clinical studies or trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, its clinical studies or trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order Forte to cease further development of or deny approval of its product candidate for any or all targeted indications. Additionally, its regulators could require significant modifications or amendments to ongoing clinical studies or trials that limit the available study population or lead to withdrawal of participation by already enrolled subjects. Any treatment-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the study or trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm Forte s business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 Further, clinical studies or trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and limited duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of its product candidate may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate. If its product candidate receives marketing approval and Forte or others identify undesirable side effects caused by such product candidate (or any other similar drugs) after such approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 
 regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of such product candidate; 

regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a boxed warning or a contraindication; 

Forte may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients; 

Forte may be required to change the way such product candidate is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product candidate; 

regulatory authorities may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy REMS ), plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools; 

Forte may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions; 

Forte may decide to remove such product candidate from the marketplace; 

Forte could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed to or using its product candidate; and 

Forte s reputation may suffer. 

Forte believes that any of these events could prevent it from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing its product candidate, if approved, and significantly impact its ability to successfully commercialize its product candidate and generate revenues. 
 Even if Forte receives regulatory approval of any product candidate, Forte will be subject to ongoing regulatory compliance obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, if Forte fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences unanticipated problems with its product candidate, if approved, Forte could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, market withdrawal, and penalties. 
 If FB102 or any other product candidate Forte develops is approved, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, export, import, conduct of post-marketing studies and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable 
 56 

foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, Forte will be subject to continued compliance with cGMP and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that Forte conducts post-approval. 
 Manufacturers and manufacturers facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, Forte and its contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA, other marketing application, and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, Forte and others with whom Forte works must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. 
 The FDA has significant post-marketing authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to evaluate serious safety risks related to the use of a drug. Any regulatory approvals that Forte receives for a product candidate may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS program as a condition of approval of any product candidate Forte develops, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves a product candidate, Forte will have to comply with requirements including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration. 
 The FDA may impose consent decrees or withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with any product candidate Forte develops, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with its third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of its products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

fines, warning or untitled enforcement letters or holds on clinical trials; 

refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by Forte or suspension or revocation of license approvals; 

product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export any product candidate; and 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label or other regulatory marketing pathway. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. In addition, the policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of any product candidate Forte develops. If Forte is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if Forte is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, Forte may lose any marketing approval that Forte may have obtained which would adversely affect its business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 57 

The policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of any product candidate Forte develops. For example, the government may implement additional measures in response to any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the Chevron doctrine, which gives deference to regulatory agencies statutory interpretations in litigation against federal government agencies, such as the FDA, where the law is ambiguous. This landmark Supreme Court decision may invite more companies and other stakeholders to bring lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, including FDA s statutory interpretations of market exclusivities and the substantial evidence requirements for drug approvals, which could undermine the FDA s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA s normal operations, any of which could delay the FDA s review of our regulatory submissions. We cannot predict the full impact of this decision, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. Forte cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. To the extent any legislative, administrative, or executive actions impose constraints on the FDA s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, its business may be negatively impacted. In addition, if Forte is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if Forte is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, Forte may lose any marketing approval that Forte may have obtained, and Forte may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 Non-compliance by Forte or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements, including safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance requirements, can also result in significant financial penalties. 
 Forte s business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which Forte operates, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit its ability to compete in foreign markets and subject it to liability if Forte violates them. 
 If Forte expand its operations outside of the United States, Forte must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which Forte plans to operate. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. 
 Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If Forte expands its presence outside of the United States, it will require Forte to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude Forte from developing, manufacturing, or selling any product candidates, if approved, outside of the United States, which could limit its growth potential and increase its development costs. 
 The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange 
 58 

Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA s accounting provisions. 
 Additionally, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. Forte has direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. Forte also expects its non-U.S. activities to increase in time. Forte plans to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and Forte can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its personnel, agents, or partners, even if Forte do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities. 
 Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of any of Forte s current and future approved products may create delays in the introduction of its products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of its products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If Forte fails to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or products targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of its products by, or in its decreased ability to export its approved products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of its approved products or limitation on its ability to export or sell its products would likely adversely affect Forte s business. 
 In particular, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations. The U.S. government has made and continues to make significant additional changes in U.S. trade policy and may continue to take future actions that could negatively impact U.S. trade. For example, legislation has been introduced in Congress to limit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by select Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing executive branch authorities to limit those Chinese service providers ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. If we are unable to obtain or use services from existing service providers or become unable to export or sell our products to any of our customers or service providers, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 
 Risks related to Forte s intellectual property 
 If Forte is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any product candidate Forte develops, its competitors could develop and commercialize products or technology similar or identical to Forte s, and its ability to successfully commercialize any product candidate Forte may develop, and its technology, may be adversely affected. 
 Forte s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to any product candidate and other technologies Forte may develop. Given that the development of its technology is at an early stage, its intellectual property portfolio with respect to certain aspects of its technology and any product candidates is also at an early stage. Forte has filed and intends to file patent 
 59 

applications on these aspects of its technology and any product candidates; however, there can be no assurance that any such patent applications will issue as granted patents. 
 Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical products are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. Forte cannot be certain, however, that the claims in its future patent applications covering the composition of matter of any product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of its issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. 
 Furthermore, in some cases, Forte may not be able to obtain issued claims covering compositions of matter relating to any product candidates it develops and instead may need to rely on filing patent applications with claims covering a method of use and/or method of manufacture. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to any product Forte develops for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their products for its targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label for those uses that are covered by its method of use patents. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. There can be no assurance that any such patent applications will issue as granted patents, and even if they do issue, such patent claims may be insufficient to prevent third parties, such as Forte s competitors, from utilizing its technology. Any failure to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to any product candidate Forte develops could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 If the scope of any patent protection Forte obtains is not sufficiently broad, or if Forte loses any future patent protection, its ability to prevent its competitors from commercializing similar or identical technology and product candidates would be adversely affected. 
 The patent position of healthcare companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of any future patent rights are highly uncertain. Forte s future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect any product candidates Forte develops, or other technologies or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates. 
 No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the biotechnology field has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish Forte s ability to protect its inventions and enforce its intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of its intellectual property. In particular, its ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe its intellectual property will depend in part on its success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover its technology, inventions and improvements. With respect to company-owned intellectual property, Forte cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications filed by it in the future, nor can Forte be sure any patents that may be granted to Forte in the future will be commercially useful in protecting its products and the methods used to manufacture those products. Moreover, even any patents that may issue to Forte do not guarantee Forte the right to practice its technology in relation to the commercialization of its products. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent Forte from commercializing any future product candidates. Any patents that may issue to Forte in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit its ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that Forte may have for any product candidate it develops. In addition, the rights granted under any patents that may issue to Forte may not provide Forte with protection or 
 60 

competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, its competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, Forte may have competition for any product candidate it develops. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent that may issue to Forte may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. 
 Any patents that Forte may own in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, Forte does not know whether any product candidate or other technologies it develops will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Forte s competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent Forte s future patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and patents that Forte may obtain may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Forte may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or to foreign patent authorities or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review, or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging future patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, Forte s future patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize any product candidates Forte develops or other technologies, and compete directly with Forte, without payment to Forte, or result in Forte s inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, Forte may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge its priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to any future owned patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit its ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of any product candidates Forte develops. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from its scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 
 In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of future product candidates, Forte s future patents protecting such a product candidate might expire before or shortly after any such product candidate is approved and commercialized. As a result, its intellectual property may not provide Forte with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 
 Forte may in the future co-own patent rights relating to future product candidates with third parties. Forte may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of its patent rights in order to enforce such patent rights against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Forte s rights to develop and commercialize any future product candidates may be subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of future licenses granted to it by others. 
 Forte may rely upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of any product candidate Forte develops. Patent rights that Forte in-license in the future may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. As a result, any such third parties may have certain rights to such intellectual property. 
 In addition, subject to the terms of any such license agreements, Forte may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance, and Forte may not have the right to control the enforcement, and defense of patents and patent applications covering the technology that Forte licenses from third parties. Forte cannot be certain that its in-licensed patent applications (and any patents issuing therefrom) that are controlled by its 
 61 

licensors will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced, and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of its business. If its licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and defend such patents rights, or lose rights to those patent applications (or any patents issuing therefrom), the rights Forte has licensed may be reduced or eliminated, its right to develop and commercialize any of its product candidates that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected, and Forte may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Moreover, Forte cannot be certain that such activities by its potential future licensors will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, even where Forte may have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications that Forte may license to and from third parties, Forte may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of its potential future licensees, licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date of assumption of control over patent prosecution. 
 If Forte fails to comply with its obligations in agreements under which we option or license intellectual property rights from future collaborators or licensors or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with future collaborators or licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business. 
 Forte may enter into agreements with future collaborators that impose various economic, development, diligence, commercialization, and other obligations on us. Such collaboration agreements may also require us to meet development timelines, or to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. Our future collaborators might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such agreements and might therefore terminate or seek damages under the agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these agreements. Termination of these agreements could cause Forte to lose the rights to certain patents or other intellectual property, or the underlying patents could fail to provide the intended exclusivity, and competitors or other third parties may have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products similar to or identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and growth prospects. 
 Moreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a collaboration agreement, including: 
 the scope of the option or license rights granted under the agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the collaborator that is not subject to the option or license rights granted under the agreement; 

the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; 

Forte s diligence obligations under the agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; 

the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our collaborators and us and our other partners; and 

the priority of invention of patented technology. 

Forte may enter into agreements to option or license intellectual property or technology from third parties that are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that Forte has optioned or licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain such arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, 
 62 

which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and growth prospects. 
 Forte may not be able to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world. 
 Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates Forte develops and other technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect its rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, Forte may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing its inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using its inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use its technologies in jurisdictions where Forte has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where Forte has patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with Forte s products, and Forte s patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for Forte to stop the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of its intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce its intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert its efforts and attention from other aspects of its business, could put its patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put its patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. Forte may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, its efforts to enforce its intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that Forte develops or licenses. 
 Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If Forte is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any future patents relevant to its business, its competitive position may be impaired, and its business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected. 
 In Europe, beginning June 1, 2023, European applications and patents may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court UPC unless those are explicitly opted out. Also, European applications will have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the UPC. This will be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty. As a single court system can invalidate a European patent, we, where applicable may opt out of the UPC and as such, each European patent would need to be challenged in each individual country. 
 Intellectual property discovered through government funded programs may be subject to federal regulations such as march-in rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for United States-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights and limit our ability to contract with non-United States manufacturers. 
 Although we do not currently own issued patents or pending patent applications that have been generated through the use of United States government funding, we may obtain intellectual property rights in future on patents and patent applications that have been generated through the use of United States government funding or grants. Pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the United States government has certain rights in inventions developed with government funding. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights (Guidance) to 
 63 

the public for comment. The Guidance represents the first federal framework specifying that price can be a factor in considering whether the government may exercise its march-in authority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq. (Bayh-Dole). These United States government march-in rights include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States government has the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (2) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations, also referred to as march-in rights. If the United States government exercised its march-in rights in our future intellectual property rights that are generated through the use of United States government funding or grants, we could be forced to license or sublicense intellectual property developed by us or that we license on terms unfavorable to us, and there can be no assurance that we would receive compensation from the United States government for the exercise of such rights. The United States government also has the right to take title to these inventions if the grant recipient fails to disclose the invention to the government or fails to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources. In addition, the United States government requires that any products embodying any of these inventions or produced through the use of any of these inventions be manufactured substantially in the United States. This preference for United States industry may be waived by the federal agency that provided the funding if the owner or assignee of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for United States industry may limit our ability to contract with non-United States product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. 
 Obtaining and maintaining Forte s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and its patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of its owned patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing Forte s ability to protect any products it develops. 
 Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before Forte could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if Forte had made the invention before it was made 
 64 

by such third party. This will require Forte to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, Forte cannot be certain that it is the first to file any patent application related to any product candidates it develops or other technologies. 
 The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate Forte s patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of Forte s owned future patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its owned future issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 In addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. It is unpredictable how decisions by the federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of Forte s patent rights. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Amgen v. Sanofi (2023) that a functionally claimed genus was invalid for failing to comply with the enablement requirement of the Patent Act. In addition, the Federal circuit recently issued a decision involving the interaction of patent term adjustment (PTA), terminal disclaimers, and obvious-type double patenting. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on Forte s future patent portfolio and its ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property in the future. 
 Forte's future issued patents covering product candidates Forte develops could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad. 
 In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of Forte s owned patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of, or amendment to Forte s future patents in such a way that they no longer cover its product candidate or other technologies. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, Forte cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which Forte and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, Forte would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on any product candidates it develops or other technologies. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products and services for an adequate amount of time. 
 Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States and abroad, if all maintenance fees/annuity fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest non-provisional filing date. The protection a patent affords is limited. Even if patents covering Forte s products are obtained, once the patent life has expired, Forte may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new products, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized. As a result, Forte s future owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 
 If Forte does not obtain patent term extension and/or data exclusivity for any product candidate that Forte may develop, its business may be materially harmed. 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidate Forte may develop, one or more of its future owned U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar extensions as compensation for patent term lost during regulatory review processes are also available in certain foreign countries and territories, such as in Europe under a Supplementary Patent Certificate. However, Forte may not be granted an extension in the United States and/or foreign countries and territories because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant future patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than Forte requests. If Forte is unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is shorter than what Forte requests, its competitors may obtain approval of competing products following its patent expiration, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. 
 Forte may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of its patents and other intellectual property. 
 Forte may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in its owned patent rights, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, Forte may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing its product candidate or other technologies. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or its ownership of its owned patent rights, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If Forte fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Forte may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to its product candidate and other technologies. Even if Forte is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 If Forte is unable to protect the confidentiality of its trade secrets, its business and competitive position would be harmed. 
 In addition to seeking patents for its product candidate and other technologies, Forte also relies on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect its unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information and to maintain its competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. Forte expects its trade secrets and know-how to over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel from academic to industry scientific positions. 
 66 

Forte currently, and may in the future continue to, relies on third parties to assist it in developing and manufacturing its product candidates. Accordingly, Forte must, at times, share know-how and trade secrets with them. Forte may in the future also enter into research and development collaborations with third parties that may require it to share know-how and trade secrets under the terms of its research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Forte seeks to protect its know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and including in its vendor and service agreements terms protecting its confidential information, know-how and trade secrets, with parties who have access to such information, such as its employees, scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. Forte also enters into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with its employees and consultants as well as trains its employees not to bring or use proprietary information or technology from former employers to Forte or in their work, and Forte reminds former employees when they leave their employment of their confidentiality obligations. However, Forte cannot guarantee that Forte has entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to its trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Forte also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of its premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. 
 Despite Forte s efforts, any of the aforementioned parties may breach the agreements and disclose Forte s proprietary information, including its trade secrets, or there may be a lapses or failures in its physical and electronic security systems which lead to its proprietary information being disclosed, and Forte may not be able to obtain adequate remedies in the event of any such breaches. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and Forte does not know whether the steps it has taken to protect its proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of its scientific advisors, employees, contractors and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, Forte may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and Forte could lose its trade secrets as a result. Moreover, if confidential information that is licensed or disclosed to Forte by its partners, collaborators, or others is inadvertently disclosed or subject to a breach or violation, Forte may be exposed to liability to the owner of that confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of its trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, Forte would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of its trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, Forte s competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. 
 Forte may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what Forte regards as its own intellectual property. 
 Many of Forte s employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other healthcare companies, including its competitors and potential competitors. Although Forte tries to ensure that its employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for Forte, Forte may be subject to claims that Forte or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If Forte fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Forte may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if Forte is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
 In addition, while it is Forte s policy to require its employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to Forte, Forte may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that Forte regards as its own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and Forte may be forced to bring claims against 
 67 

third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what Forte regards as its intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against Forte or its collaborators may prevent or delay the development and commercialization of any product candidates and other technologies Forte develops. 
 The field of therapeutics targeting autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases is competitive and dynamic. Due to the focused research and development that is taking place by several companies, including Forte and its competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. As such, there may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings relating to Forte s owned, and other third party, intellectual property and proprietary rights in the future. 
 Forte s commercial success depends in part on its and its collaborators ability to avoid infringing, misappropriating and otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of complex litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. As discussed above, recently, due to changes in U.S. law referred to as patent reform, new procedures including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented. As stated above, this reform adds uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to Forte s future patents. 
 Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist relating to autoimmune technologies and in the fields in which Forte is developing its product candidate. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that its product candidate and other technologies may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Forte cannot assure you that its product candidate and other technologies that Forte has developed, are developing or may develop in the future will not infringe existing or future patents owned by third parties. Forte may not be aware of patents that have already been issued and that a third party, for example, a competitor in the fields in which Forte is developing its product candidate and other technologies, might assert infringement by future Forte product candidates or other technologies, including claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of use or treatment that cover future Forte product candidates or other technologies. It is also possible that patents owned by third parties of which Forte is aware, but which Forte does not believe Forte infringes or that Forte believes Forte has valid defenses to any claims of patent infringement, could be found to be infringed by Forte. It is not unusual that corresponding patents issued in different countries have different scopes of coverage, such that in one country a third-party patent does not pose a material risk, but in another country, the corresponding third-party patent may pose a material risk to Forte s product candidates. As such, we monitor third-party patents in the fields in which Forte is developing its product candidate. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that future Forte product candidates or other technologies may infringe. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) resources that are publicly available also present a risk that Forte may inadvertently obtain, incorporate, or use a third party s intellectual property. Forte cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against its current technology, manufacturing methods, product candidates, or future methods or products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting its manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to its future sales, an obligation on its part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant. 
 
 Forte may identify third-party patents in which it will determine that the best course of action is to challenge the validity of such third-party patents in a post-grant proceeding at the USPTO, such as in a reexamination, or a post-grant and inter partes review. Such third-party patents may have claims broadly covering autoimmune technologies in which Forte is developing its product candidate. Forte recently identified U.S. Patent No. 11,278,505, (the 505 Patent ), owned by the University of Massachusetts, which claims broad field of autoimmune technologies. Forte filed a petition for post grant review of U.S. Patent No. 11,278,505, owned by the University of Massachusetts, at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) on December 22, 2022. On July 3, 2023, the PTAB issued a decision to institute review. On June 24, 2024, the PTAB issued a final written decision, finding 
 68 

all claims of the 505 Patent unpatentable. The University of Massachusetts filed a request for rehearing on July 24, 2024. The PTAB denied the request for rehearing on October 30, 2024. The outcome of such post-grant proceedings is uncertain and if the USPTO upholds the validity of a third-party patent, it could have an adverse impact on Forte s ability to commercialize its future products, including either an injunction prohibiting its manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to its future sales, an obligation on its part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant. Regardless of outcome, challenging the validity of third-party patents can have an adverse impact on us due to legal fees and expenses, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors. 
 Third parties may have patents or obtain patents in the future and claim that the manufacture, use or sale of Forte s product candidates or other technologies infringes upon these patents. In the event that any third-party claims that Forte infringes their patents or that Forte is otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if Forte believes such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that such patents are valid, enforceable and infringed by Forte s product candidates or other technologies. In this case, the holders of such patents may be able to block Forte s ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate or technology unless Forte obtains a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if Forte is able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate Forte to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to Forte might be non-exclusive, which could result in its competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. If Forte is unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, Forte may be unable to commercialize its product candidates or other technologies, or such commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm Forte s business. 
 Defense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from Forte s business, and may impact its reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against Forte, Forte may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing its infringing product candidate or other technologies. In addition, Forte may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties and/or redesign its infringing product candidate or technologies, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, Forte would be unable to further develop and commercialize any future product candidate or other technologies, which could harm its business significantly. 
 Engaging in litigation to defend against third parties alleging that Forte has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their patents or other intellectual property rights is very expensive, particularly for a company of its size, and time-consuming. Some of its competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than Forte can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings against Forte could impair its ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Forte may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful. 
 Competitors may infringe Forte s future patents, or Forte may be required to defend against claims of infringement. In addition, its patents also may become involved in inventorship, priority or validity disputes. To counter or defend against such claims can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a future patent owned by Forte is invalid or unenforceable, the other party s use of its patented technology falls under the safe harbor to patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1), or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that its owned future patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of its owned future patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Even if Forte establishes infringement, the court may 
 69 

decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Forte s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. 
 Even if resolved in Forte s favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause Forte to incur significant expenses and could distract its personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of Forte s common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase its operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. Forte may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of its competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than Forte can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on Forte s ability to compete in the marketplace. 
 Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats. 
 The degree of future protection afforded by Forte s intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect its business or permit Forte to maintain its competitive advantage. For example: 
 others may be able to make products that are similar to Forte s product candidate or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that Forte may own; 

Forte, or its current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that Forte may own in the future; 

Forte, or its current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of its or their inventions; 

others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of Forte s technologies without infringing Forte s owned intellectual property rights; 

it is possible that Forte s future pending owned patent applications will not lead to issued patents; 

future issued patents that Forte holds rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by its competitors or other third parties; 

Forte s competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where Forte does not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in its major commercial markets; 

Forte may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; 

the patents of others may harm Forte s business; and 

Forte may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property. 

Should any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on Forte s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 70 

Risks related to Forte s reliance on third parties 
 We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies, and plan to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research and studies. 
 We plan to utilize and depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as medical institutions, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and strategic partners to conduct and support our preclinical studies under agreements with us and plan to continue to do so for our future clinical trials. These third parties have had and will continue to have a significant role in the conduct of our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. 
 These third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that any such third party will devote to our preclinical studies or our planned clinical trials. The third parties we rely on for these services may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. Some of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. We also expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, clinical trial sites and CMOs and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with, or replace or add any third parties, it would involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus, or involve a transition period, and may delay our drug development activities, as well as materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. 
 Our heavy reliance on these third parties for such drug development activities will reduce our control over these activities. As a result, we will have less direct control over the conduct, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCP standards, regulations for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are reliable and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The EMA also requires us to comply with similar standards. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. There can be no assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials substantially comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients, may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws. 
 If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, or if these third parties need to be replaced, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. 
 71 

We have contracted with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and expect to continue to do so for additional preclinical studies, clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quality and quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
 We do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates for use in development and commercialization. We have relied and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. We do not have long-term supply agreements, and we purchase our required drug product on a purchase order basis, which means that aside from any binding purchase orders we have from time to time, our supplier could cease supplying to us or change the terms on which it is willing to continue supplying to us at any time. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials. 
 We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including: 
 the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our schedule and specifications, or at all, including if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them; 

the reduction or termination of production or deliveries by suppliers, or the raising or prices or renegotiation of terms; 

the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; 

the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them; 

the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including cGMPs; 

the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them; 

the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications; 

the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified; 

clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and 

the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how. 

We do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturing partners and are dependent on these contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing our product candidates. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to 
 72 

maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we will need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, and those new facilities would need to be inspected and approved by FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authority prior to commencing manufacturing, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations. 
 Third-party relationships are important to Forte s business. If Forte is unable to maintain its collaborations, enter into new relationships or if these relationships are not successful, its business could be adversely affected. 
 Forte has limited capabilities for product development and do not yet have any capability for sales, marketing or distribution. Accordingly, Forte enters into relationships with other companies to provide it with important technologies, and Forte may receive additional technologies and funding under these and other collaborations in the future. Relationships Forte enters into may pose a number of risks, including the following: 
 third parties have, and future third-party collaborators may have, significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply; 

current and future third parties may not perform their obligations as expected; 

current and future third parties may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidate that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the third parties strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as a strategic merger that may divert resources or create competing priorities; 

third parties may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; 

current and future third parties could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with Forte s products and product candidate if the third parties believe that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; 

product candidates discovered in collaboration with Forte may be viewed by its current or future third parties as competitive with their own product candidate or products, which may cause such third parties to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of its product candidate; 

current and future third parties may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, distribution or marketing of a product candidate or product; 

current and future third parties with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of Forte s product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; 

disagreements with current or future third parties, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development or commercialization of product candidate, might lead to additional responsibilities for Forte with respect to product candidate, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; 

current and future third parties may not properly maintain or defend its intellectual property rights or may use its proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate its intellectual property or proprietary information or expose Forte to potential litigation;

current and future third parties may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose Forte to litigation and potential liability; 

if a current or future third parties of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by Forte; and 

current and future relationships may be terminated by the collaborator, and, if terminated, Forte could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate. 

If Forte s relationships do not result in the successful discovery, development and commercialization of products or if one of its third parties terminates its agreement with Forte, Forte may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If Forte does not receive the funding Forte expects under these agreements, its development of its technology and product candidates could be delayed, and Forte may need additional resources to develop product candidate and its technology. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this prospectus also apply to the activities of its collaborators. 
 Additionally, if any of Forte s current or future third parties terminate their agreement with Forte, Forte may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and its perception in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. 
 Relationships are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Forte faces significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Forte s ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon its assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. If Forte is unable to reach agreements with suitable third parties on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, Forte may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase its expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at its own expense. If Forte elects to increase its expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, Forte may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all. If Forte fails to enter into relationships or does not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, Forte may not be able to further develop its product candidates, bring them to market and generate revenue from sales of drugs or continue to develop its technology, and its business may be materially and adversely affected. 
 General Risks 
 
 The market price of Forte s common stock is expected to be volatile. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. 
 The market price of Forte s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. For example, Forte s announcement in September 2021 that the clinical trial of FB-401 for the treatment of AD failed to meet statistical significance for its primary endpoint of EASI-50 (the proportion of patients with at least a 50 improvement in atopic dermatitis disease severity as measured by EASI) resulted in a significant decline in the market price of Forte s common stock. Following the announcement on September 2, 2021, the price of Forte s common stock dropped 588.25 per share, or approximately 82 , from 714.75 per share as of the close of business on September 2, 2021 to 126.50 per share as of the close of business on September 3, 2021. The closing price of Forte s common 
 74 

stock on November 8, 2024 was 5.10 per share. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of Forte s common stock to fluctuate include: 
 any strategic decisions that Forte pursues or announces, including Forte s decision to focus on the development of FB102; 

Forte s ability to obtain regulatory approvals for any product candidates it develops, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals; 

failure of any of Forte s product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success; 

Forte s failure to maintain its existing third-party license and supply agreements; 

failure by Forte or its licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce its intellectual property rights; 

changes in laws or regulations applicable to product candidates Forte develops; 

any inability to obtain adequate supply of any product candidates Forte develops or the inability to do so at acceptable prices; 

adverse regulatory authority decisions; 

introduction of new products, services or technologies by Forte s competitors; 

failure to meet or exceed financial and development projections Forte may provide to the public; 

failure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community; 

the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community; 

announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by Forte or its competitors; 

disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and Forte s ability to obtain patent protection for its technologies; 

additions or departures of key personnel; 

significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Forte s business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding its business and stock; 

changes in the market valuations of similar companies; 

general market or macroeconomic conditions; 

the ability for Forte s common stock to continue to be listed on Nasdaq; 

sales of Forte s common stock by Forte or its stockholders in the future; 

trading volume of Forte s common stock; 

announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; 

adverse publicity generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets; 

the introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with potential products of Forte; 

changes in the structure of health care payment systems; and 

period-to-period fluctuations in Forte s financial results. 

75 

Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the company s profitability and reputation. In addition, such securities litigation often has ensued after a reverse merger or other merger and acquisition activity. Such litigation if brought could negatively impact our business. 
 In addition, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section of this Form 10-Q, in August 2023, a stockholder filed a complaint against Forte and its directors and officers related to the Private Placement, which has been resolved. Additional lawsuits may be filed in the future related to the Company s financing transactions. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation related to the Private Placement, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the company s profitability and reputation. 
 Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price. 
 The global credit and financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such military conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East, may also adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by affected countries and others could exacerbate market and economic instability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive an economic downturn, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. 
 
 Forte has previously been and may in the future be noncompliant with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement, which could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit investors ability to trade in our common stock. 
 
 Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq rules impose certain continued listing requirements, including the minimum 1 bid price, corporate governance standards and number of public stockholders. On September 14, 2023, we were notified by Nasdaq that we are not compliant with its minimum bid price requirement because the closing bid price of our common stock was below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 12, 2024 to become compliant. On March 13, 2024, we received an extension of 180 calendar days, or until September 9, 2024 (the Deadline Date ), to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. 
 
 On August 28, 2024, we implemented a 1-for-25 reverse stock split. On September 12, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq that, for the 10 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of our common stock had been at 
 76 

1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, we have regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and Nasdaq considers the prior minimum bid price deficiency matter now closed. 
 
 If, in the future, we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our shares of common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our shares of common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our shares of common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. Delisting could also result in a determination that our shares of common stock are a penny stock, which would require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary market for our shares of common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our shares of common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our shares of common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. 
 Forte incurs additional costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies. 
 As a public company, Forte incurs and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. Forte costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as any new requirements implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations have increased Forte s legal and financial compliance costs from when it was a private company and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. These rules and regulations also may make it difficult and expensive for Forte to obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for Forte to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on its board of directors or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in and could cause Forte s business or stock price to suffer. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in Forte s charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Forte more difficult and may prevent attempts by Forte s stockholders to replace or remove the company management. 
 Provisions in Forte s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. In addition, because Forte is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15 of the outstanding company voting stock from merging or combining with Forte. Although Forte believes these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with Forte s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by Forte s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. 
 Forte s bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between Forte and its stockholders, which could limit its stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Forte or its directors, officers or other employees. 
 Forte s bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on Forte s behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of its directors, officers or other employees to Forte or its stockholders, any action asserting a claim against it arising pursuant to any provisions of the DGCL, its certificate of incorporation or its bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against it that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided , that these choice of forum provisions do 
 77 

not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with Forte or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against Forte and its directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Forte may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. 
 Forte does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 The current expectation is that Forte will retain its future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of Forte s common stock will be its stockholders sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future. 
 Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause Forte s stock price to decline. 
 If existing stockholders of Forte sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of the Forte s common stock in the public market, the trading price of Forte s common stock could decline. Forte is not able to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of Forte s common stock. 
 If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about Forte, its business or its market, its stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for Forte s common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about it and its business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of Forte s common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of its common stock. In the event it does have equity research analyst coverage, Forte will not have any control over the analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of Forte s common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade its stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of Forte or fails to publish reports on it regularly, demand for its common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline. 
 The company will have broad discretion in the use of proceeds from any capital raising efforts, including the Private Placement and any future private placement financings, and may invest or spend the proceeds in ways with which its stockholders do not agree and in ways that may not increase the value of their investments. 
 Forte has and will continue to have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from any capital raising efforts, including private placement financings and public offerings completed in 2020 and 2023 and an at the market equity offering program commenced in 2022. Its stockholders may not agree with Forte s decisions, and its use of the proceeds may not yield any return on its stockholders investments. Forte s failure to apply the net proceeds of such financings effectively could compromise its ability to pursue its growth strategy and Forte might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on its investment of these net proceeds. Forte s stockholders will not have the opportunity to influence its decisions on how to use the net proceeds from such financings. 
 Forte previously identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the review of the annual income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022, which had been prepared by a third-party accounting firm that has since been remediated. If Forte experiences material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 Forte is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Forte maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Forte must perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the 
 78 

effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This requires that Forte incur substantial professional fees and internal costs to expand its accounting and finance functions and that it expends significant management efforts. Forte may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. 
 During the audit process related to Forte s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, management identified a material weakness in Forte s controls related to the review of the annual income tax provision which had been prepared by a third-party accounting firm that has since been remediated. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Forte may in the future discover additional weaknesses in its system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of its financial statements. Forte s internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. 
 If Forte is not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if it is unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, Forte may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of its common stock could decline and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 
 Forte is able to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could result in its common stock being less attractive to investors. 
 Forte currently qualifies as a smaller reporting company under the rules of the SEC. As a smaller reporting company, Forte is able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements, such as simplified executive compensation disclosures and reduced financial statement disclosure requirements in its SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in Forte s SEC filings due to its status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze its results of operations and financial prospects. Forte cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive if it relies on these exemptions. If some investors find its common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and its stock price may be more volatile. Forte may take advantage of the reporting exemptions applicable to a smaller reporting company until it is no longer a smaller reporting company, which status would end once it has a public float greater than 250 million. In that event, Forte could still be a smaller reporting company if its annual revenues were below 100 million and it has a public float of less than 700 million. 
 Forte s principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Forte s executive officers, directors, holders of 5 or more of its capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned a significant percentage of its outstanding voting stock. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to impact matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to impact elections of directors, amendments of Forte s organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for Forte s common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of Forte s stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for Forte s common stock.
