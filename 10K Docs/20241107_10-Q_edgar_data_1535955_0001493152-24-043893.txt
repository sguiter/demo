There
were sales of marketable investment securities during either the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and therefore
 realized gains or losses. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million of
marketable investment securities matured, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million
of marketable securities matured, respectively. The Company determined there were other-than-temporary impairments for either the
three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

All
of the Company s financial instruments are valued using quoted prices in active markets or based on other observable inputs. For
accrued interest income, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The following table presents the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The
following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value
in the balance sheets: 

Cash
equivalents: Cash equivalents primarily consist of highly rated money market funds and treasury bills with original maturities to the
Company of three months or less and are purchased daily at par value with specified yield rates. Cash equivalents related to money market
funds and treasury bills are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices
or broker or dealer quotations for similar assets. 

Government
treasury bills: The Company uses a third-party pricing service to value these investments. United States treasury bills are classified
within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets
and reportable trades. 

U.S.
government agency securities: The Company uses a third-party pricing service to value these investments. U.S. government agency securities
are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using broker/dealer quotes, bids and offers, benchmark
yields and credit spreads and other observable inputs. 

Warrant
liability: The warrant liability (which relates to warrants to purchase shares of common stock)
is marked-to-market each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded to other income (expense) in the accompanying statements
of operations until the warrants are exercised, expire or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified
to stockholders equity. The fair value of the warrant liability is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The significant
assumptions used in preparing the option pricing model for valuing the warrant liability as of September 30, 2024, include (i) volatility
of , (ii) risk free interest rate of , (iii) strike price of , (iv) fair value of common stock of , and (v) with
the warrants expiring on , expected life of years. The significant assumptions used in preparing the option pricing
model for valuing the warrant liability as of December 31, 2023, include (i) volatility of , (ii) risk free interest rate of ,
(iii) strike price of , (iv) fair value of common stock of , and (v) expected life of years. 

The
Company s accounting policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy on the date of the event or changes
in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for the three or nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

million consisting of an initial payment
of million which was received on signing of the Verity License Agreement, million which was received on February 1, 2024, 
million to be paid no later than January 1, 2025, and million to be paid no later than January 1, 2026. The Company is also eligible
to receive development and sales milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate, depending primarily on the achievement
of certain sales milestones in a single calendar year with respect to all products licensed by GSL under the Verity License Agreement.
Under the Verity License Agreement, GSL is generally responsible for expenses relating to the development (including the conduct of any
clinical trials) and commercialization of licensed products in the Field in the Licensed Verity Territory, while the Company is generally responsible
for expenses relating to development activities outside of the Field and/or the Licensed Verity Territory. 

The
Company concluded that licensing revenue recognized in conjunction with the Verity License Agreement met the requirements under ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts
the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. License revenue from payments to be received in the future will be recognized
when it is probable that we will receive license payments under the terms of the Verity License Agreement. 

Under
the Verity License Agreement with Verity Pharma, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t recognize any
royalty revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million in licensing revenue and approximately
 in royalty revenue. 

(b) Antares
 Pharma, Inc. 

On
October 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Antares License Agreement with Antares pursuant to which the Company granted to Antares
an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize, upon final approval of TLANDO from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), the Company s TLANDO product with respect to testosterone replacement
therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, as indicated in NDA No. 208088, treatment
of Klinefelter syndrome, and pediatric indications relating to testosterone replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with
a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, in each case within the United States. TLANDO received FDA approval on March 29,
2022. 

Upon
execution of the Antares License Agreement, Antares paid the Company an initial payment of million. Antares agreed to make additional
payments of million to the Company on each of January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026, provided that certain conditions were satisfied.
The Company was also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of
certain sales milestones in a single calendar year with respect to TLANDO, as licensed by Antares under the Antares License Agreement.
In addition, the Company was to receive tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from percentages in the mid-teens up to of net sales
of TLANDO in the United States, subject to certain minimum royalty obligations. On October 2, 2023, the Company received notice from
Antares of Antares termination of the Antares License Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Antares License Agreement,
the Antares License Agreement terminated effective January 31, 2024. On January 12, 2024, the Company entered into the Verity License
Agreement with Verity Pharma. Upon termination of the Antares License Agreement, all rights and licenses granted by the Company to Antares
under the Antares License Agreement terminated and all rights in TLANDO were transferred to the Company s new licensing partner,
Verity Pharma. 

Under
the Antares License Agreement, the Company did not recognize revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recognized
a reversal of variable consideration for minimum guaranteed royalties of million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Under the Antares License Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of approximately during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and recognized a reversal of variable consideration for minimum guaranteed royalties of million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The Company does not expect to receive any further royalties under the Antares License Agreement in the future. 

(c) Abbott
 Products, Inc. 

On
March 29, 2012, the Company terminated its collaborative agreement with Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (later acquired by Abbott Products,
Inc. Abbott for TLANDO. As part of the termination, the Company reacquired the rights to the intellectual property from
Abbott. All obligations under the prior license agreement have been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual royalty
on net sales. Such royalties are limited to million in the first two calendar years following product launch, after which period
there is not a cap on royalties and no maximum aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties
are reduced by . TLANDO was commercially launched on June 7, 2022. The Company incurred royalty expense of approximately and 
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately and during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(d)

dividend was based on the number of shares of outstanding common stock on March 24, 2023, and resulted in Series B Preferred shares
being issued. The outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled to vote together with the outstanding shares
of common stock as a single class exclusively with respect to any proposal to adopt an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation ), to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding
 shares of Common Stock at a ratio determined in accordance with the terms of such amendment (the

(c) Rights
 Agreement 

On

Also on November 12, 2015, the Board of the Company authorized and the Company declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right
(each a Right and collectively, the Rights for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. The
dividend was payable to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2015 and entitles the registered holder to
purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a fully paid non-assessable share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of
the Company at a price of per one-thousandth share (the Purchase Price ). The Rights will generally become exercisable
upon the earlier to occur of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below) or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action
of the Board prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) following the
commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in
the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15 or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Except in certain situations,
a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person upon acquiring beneficial ownership of
15 or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

In
general, in the event a person becomes an Acquiring Person, then each Right not owned by such Acquiring Person will entitle its holder
to purchase from the Company, at the Right s then current exercise price, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, common stock of the Company with a market value of twice the Purchase Price. In addition, if after any person has become an Acquiring
Person, (a) the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or (b) 50 or more of the Company s assets, or assets
accounting for 50 or more of its earning power, are sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise transferred (in one or more transactions),
proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right (other than the Acquiring Person, its affiliates and associates and certain
transferees thereof, whose Rights became void) shall thereafter have the right to purchase from the acquiring corporation, for the Purchase
Price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation which at the time of such transaction would have a market value
of twice the Purchase Price. 

The
Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at per Right at any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such. The
terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement, which is summarized in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K dated
November 13, 2015. The rights plan was originally set to expire on November 12, 2018; however, on November 5, 2018 our Board approved
an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement pursuant to which the expiration date was extended to November 5, 2021, and again on November
2, 2021, the Company adopted a Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement pursuant to which the expiration date was extended to November
1, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Company adopted a Third Amended and Restated Rights Agreement pursuant to which the expiration date
was extended to October 22, 2027, unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company. 

(d) Share-Based
 Payments 

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards, restricted stock units and restricted stock under
the Company s Incentive Plan to employees, nonemployees and nonemployee members of the Company s Board based on the grant-date
fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award s
requisite service period. In addition, the Company has granted performance-based stock option awards and restricted stock units, which
vest based upon the Company satisfying certain performance conditions. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related
to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when, the Company estimates that these options or units will vest, which
is based on whether the Company considers the performance conditions to be probable of attainment. The Company s estimates of the
number of performance-based options or units that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. 

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated
based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of the Company s common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over
which employees and members of the board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected term), (iii) expected
dividend yield on the Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which
is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. This estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation cost that has been expensed in the statements of
operations amounted to approximately and , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and
approximately and , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and is allocated as follows: 

General
 and administrative 

Total 

The
Company issued stock options, during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and issued and stock
options, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Key
assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of stock options granted are as follows: 

Expected
Term : The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term was estimated
using the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option. For awards with performance conditions, and that
have the contractual term to satisfy the performance condition, the contractual term was used. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate used was based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an
equivalent remaining term. 

Expected
Dividend : The expected dividend assumption is based on management s current expectation about the Company s anticipated
dividend policy. The Company does not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Expected
Volatility : The volatility factor is based solely on the Company s trading history.

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for the portion of options that are expected to vest. Therefore, the Company applied estimated
forfeiture rates that were derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those
estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there was approximately of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option compensation
granted under the Company s stock option plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years
and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, there was of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock units that have either time-based or performance vesting. 

(e) Stock
 Option Plan 

In
April 2014, the Board adopted the 2014 Stock and Incentive Plan 2014 Plan subject to shareholder approval which was received
in June 2014. The 2014 Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock units, restricted stock and dividend equivalents. An aggregate of shares were authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan.
Additionally, remaining authorized shares under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan 2011 Plan were issuable under the
2014 Plan at the time of the 2014 Plan adoption. Upon receiving shareholder approval in June 2016, the 2014 Plan was amended and restated
to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock of the Company issuable under all awards granted under the 2014 Plan from
 to . Additionally, upon receiving shareholder approval in June 2018, the 2014 Plan was further amended and restated to
increase the authorized number of shares of common stock of the Company issuable under all awards granted under the 2014 Plan from 
to . Upon receiving shareholder approval in June 2020, the 2014 Plan was further amended and restated to increase the authorized
number of shares of common stock of the Company issuable under all awards granted under the 2014 Plan from to . In June
2024, the 2014 Plan was further amended and restated to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock of the Company issuable
under all awards granted from to . The Board, on an option-by-option basis, determines the number of shares, exercise
price, term, and vesting period for options granted. Options granted generally have a ten -year contractual life. The Company issues shares
of common stock upon the exercise of options with the source of those shares of common stock being either newly issued shares or shares
held in treasury. An aggregate of shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan, with shares
remaining available for grant as of September 30, 2024.

(g) Common
 Stock Warrants 

The
Company accounts for its common stock warrants under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , which requires any financial
instrument, other than an outstanding share, that, at inception, embodies an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares,
or is indexed to such an obligation, and requires or may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets, to be classified
as a liability. In accordance with ASC 480, the Company s outstanding warrants from the November 2019 Offering are classified as
a liability. The liability is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period, with the changes in fair value recognized as gain (loss)
on change in fair value of warrant liability in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The warrants issued in the
November 2019 Offering allow the warrant holder, if certain change in control events occur, the option to receive an amount of cash equal
to the value of the warrants as determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing model with certain defined assumptions
upon a fundamental transaction. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had common stock warrants outstanding from the November 2019 Offering to purchase an equal
number of shares of common stock. The fair value of these warrants on September 30, 2024 and on December 31, 2023 was determined using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following Level 3 inputs (as defined in the November 2019 Offering):

Overview
of Our Business 

We
are a biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our proprietary Lip ral platform to develop differentiated products through
the oral delivery of previously difficult to deliver molecules, focused on treating Central Nervous System CNS disorders.
Our proprietary delivery technologies are designed to improve patient compliance and safety through orally available treatment options.
Our primary development programs are based on oral delivery solutions for poorly bioavailable drugs. We have a portfolio of differentiated
innovative product candidates that target high unmet needs for neurological and psychiatric CNS disorders, liver diseases, and hormone
supplementation for men and women. 

On March 28, 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA approved TLANDO TLANDO as a testosterone replacement therapy TRT comprised of testosterone undecanoate TU in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous
testosterone, also known as hypogonadism. On June 7, 2022, our former commercial partner Antares Pharma, Inc. Antares, a wholly owned subsidiary of Halozyme)
announced the commercial launch of TLANDO. On January 12, 2024, we entered into a license agreement (the Verity License Agreement for the development
and commercialization of our approved product, TLANDO with Gordon Silver Limited and Verity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Verity
Pharma pursuant to which we granted to Verity Pharma an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop
and commercialize the TLANDO product for TRT in the U.S. and
Canada (the Licensed Verity Territory ). Any FDA required post-marketing studies will also be the responsibility of Verity Pharma.
The Verity License Agreement also provides Verity Pharma with a license to develop and commercialize LPCN 1111 (also referred to as TLANDO
XR), the Company s potential next generation, once daily oral product candidate for TRT comprised of testosterone tridecanoate,
in the U.S. and Canada. 

In
September 2024, we entered into a distribution and license agreement (the SPC License Agreement for the
development and commercialization of TLANDO, an oral TRT with SPC Korea Limited SPC ), pursuant to which the Company granted to SPC a
non-transferable, exclusive, royalty-bearing license to commercialize our TLANDO product for TRT in South Korea (the SPC
Territory ). In October 2024, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with Pharmalink granting a
non-transferable, exclusive, license to commercialize our TLANDO product in the Field specific to the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC ), including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates UAE ), Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman (the Pharmalink
Territory ). 

22 

Additional
clinical development pipeline candidates include: LPCN 1154 for postpartum depression PPD LPCN 2101 for epilepsy; LPCN
2203 for essential tremor and LPCN 2401 for improved body composition in obesity management. In addition to our clinical development
product candidates, we have assets for which we expect to seek partnerships to enable further development including TLANDO for territories
outside of the United States, Canada, South Korea, and the GCC, LPCN 1148 comprising a novel prodrug of testosterone and testosterone
laurate TL ), for the management of decompensated cirrhosis, LPCN 1144, an oral prodrug of androgen receptor modulator
for the treatment of non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH which has completed Phase 2 testing; and LPCN 1107,
potentially the first oral hydroxy progesterone caproate HPC product indicated for the prevention of recurrent preterm
birth PTB ), which has completed a dose finding clinical study in pregnant women and has been granted orphan drug designation
by the FDA. 

The
following chart summarizes the status of our product candidate development and partnering programs: 

Corporate
Strategy 

Our
goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our proprietary Lip ral drug delivery technology platform
to develop differentiated products through oral delivery of previously difficult to deliver molecules for CNS disorders. The key components
of our strategy are to: 

Advance
LPCN 1154 and other CNS product candidates. We intend to focus on the development of endogenous neuroactive steroids NASs which have broad applicability in treating various CNS conditions where we can leverage our technology platform to develop highly differentiated
oral therapeutics. Our priority is on the development of LPCN 1154, a fast-acting oral antidepressant for postpartum depression PPD with potential for outpatient use. 

Support
our licensees, Verity Pharma, SPC, and Pharmalink in commercialization and/or development of our licensed oral TRT option. We
believe the TRT market needs a differentiated, convenient oral option. We have exclusively licensed rights to TLANDO to Verity Pharma
for commercialization of TLANDO in the U.S. and Canada (the Licensed Verity Territory ), to SPC for commercialization in South
Korea (the SPC Territory and to Pharmalink in the GCC (the Pharmalink Territory ). We plan to support Verity
Pharma s, SPC s and Pharmalink s efforts to effectively enable the availability of TLANDO to patients in a timely manner,
in addition to receiving milestone and royalty payments associated with TLANDO commercialization as agreed to in the Verity License Agreement,
the SPC License Agreement, and the Pharmalink License Agreement. 

23 

Develop
partnership(s) to continue the advancement of pipeline assets . We continuously strive to prioritize our resources in seeking
partnerships for our pipeline assets. We are currently exploring partnerships for our liver programs LPCN 1144, our candidate for
treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH and LPCN 1148 for the management of decompensated cirrhosis including prevention of the recurrence
of overt hepatic encephalopathy OHE ), LPCN 2401 for improved body composition in obesity management as an adjunct
therapy to or as a monotherapy post cessation of incretin mimetics use, and LPCN 1107, our candidate for prevention of pre-term
birth. We are also exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1021 (known as TLANDO in the United States) to third parties outside
of the Licensed Verity Territory, the SPC Territory and the Pharmalink Territory, although as of the date of this report, no licensing
agreement has been entered into by the Company in any other territories. 

Our
Pipeline Product Candidates 

Our
pipeline of clinical development candidates includes LPCN 1154 for PPD, LPCN 2101 for epilepsy, LPCN 2203 for essential tremor, and LPCN
2401 as an aid for improved body composition in obesity management. We will continue to explore other product development candidates
targeting CNS indications with a significant unmet need. We will also continue efforts to enter into partnership arrangements for the
continued development and/or marketing of LPCN 1144, LPCN 1148, LPCN 2401, LPCN 1107 as well as for the TRT assets outside of the Licensed Verity Territory, the SPC Territory, and the Pharmalink Territory. 

Our
products are based on our proprietary Lip ral drug delivery technology platform. Lip ral-based TLANDO was approved by the
FDA in March 2022. Lip ral technology is a patented technology based on lipidic compositions which form an optimal dispersed phase
in the gastrointestinal environment for improved absorption of insoluble drugs. The drug loaded dispersed phase presents the solubilized
drug efficiently at the absorption site (gastrointestinal tract membrane) thus improving the absorption process and making the drug less
dependent on physiological variables such as dilution, gastro-intestinal pH and food effects for absorption. Lip ral-based formulation
enables improved solubilization and higher drug-loading capacity, which can lead to improved bioavailability, reduced dose, faster and
more consistent absorption, reduced variability, reduced sensitivity to food effects, improved patient compliance, and targeted lymphatic
delivery where appropriate.

As
previously described, under the Verity License Agreement, in January 2024, we granted to Verity Pharma an exclusive, royalty-bearing,
sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize TLANDO, our product for TRT, in the U.S. and Canada effective February 1,
2024. TLANDO received FDA approval on March 28, 2022. Any FDA requirement to conduct certain post-marketing studies will be the responsibility
of Verity Pharma. In addition, in September 2024, we granted SPC an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to commercialize TLANDO in
South Korea and in October 2024 we granted Pharmalink an exclusive license to commercialize TLANDO in the GCC countries. 

Proof-of-concept
for TLANDO was initially established in 2006, and TLANDO was subsequently licensed in 2009 to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which
was then acquired by Abbott Products, Inc. Abbott ). Following a portfolio review associated with the spin-off of
AbbVie Inc. by Abbott in 2011, the rights to TLANDO were reacquired by us. All obligations under the prior license agreement have
been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual 1 royalty on net sales of TLANDO. Such royalties are limited to 1
million in the first two calendar years following product launch, after which period there is no cap on royalties and no maximum
aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties are reduced by 50 . TLANDO was commercially
launched on June 7, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred royalty expense of approximately 16,000 and
 22,000, respectively. 

Since
TLANDO received full FDA approval, under the terms of the Verity License Agreement, Verity Pharma will need to assess the safety and
effectiveness of TLANDO in pediatric patients, as required by the Pediatric Research Equity Act. The FDA may also require certain post-marketing
studies to be conducted which will also be the responsibility of Verity Pharma. Similarly, SPC and Pharmalink are responsible for
obtaining any regulatory/marketing approvals for TLANDO required for the SPC Territory and the Pharmalink Territory, respectively. 

Upon
execution of the Verity License Agreement, Verity Pharma paid us an initial payment of 2.5 million which was received on signing of
the License Agreement and 5 million which was received on February 1, 2024. Verity Pharma is also required to make an additional payment
of 2.5 million to us before January 1, 2025, and an additional payment of 1 million to us before January 1, 2026. We are also eligible
to receive milestone payments of up to 259 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of certain sales milestones in a single
calendar year and/or development milestones with respect to products licensed by Verity Pharma under the Verity License Agreement. In
addition, we will receive tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from 12 up to 18 of net sales of all products licensed under the
Verity License Agreement in the Licensed Verity Territory. 

24 

SPC
paid us a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront fee in October 2024. We are eligible to receive additional payments including a
non-refundable, non-creditable payment in consideration for TLANDO product inventory, marketing authorization and sales milestones,
and we will supply TLANDO to SPC and receive a supply price. In addition, we will receive royalties on net sales in South Korea
under the SPC License Agreement. 

Upon execution of the Pharmalink License Agreement, 
Pharmalink paid us for a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront fee. Under the Pharmalink License Agreement, we
could receive additional payments in regulatory authorization milestones and we will supply TLANDO to Pharmalink at an agreed transfer price. 

We
are exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1021 (known as TLANDO in the United States) to third parties outside the United States,
Canada, South Korea, and the GCC countries, although no licensing agreement has been entered into by the Company in any other territories.
If and when an agreement is made with a partner, such arrangement would likely be partially contingent upon obtaining local regulatory
approval. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed or, if an agreement is completed, that such an agreement
would be on terms favorable to us. 

LPCN
1111: A Next-Generation Long-Acting Oral Product Candidate for TRT 

As
previously described, under the terms of the Verity License Agreement, we have licensed the development and commercialization rights
to LPCN 1111 (TLANDO XR) in the Licensed Verity Territory to Verity Pharma. We will continue to explore the possibility of partnering LPCN 1111
with third parties outside of the Licensed Verity Territory, although no additional partnering agreement has been entered into by the Company.
No assurance can be given that any license agreement outside of the Licensed Verity Territory, will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed,
that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us. 

LPCN
1111 is a next-generation, novel ester prodrug of testosterone comprised of testosterone tridecanoate which uses our proprietary delivery
technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. We completed a Phase 2b dose finding study in hypogonadal men in the
third quarter of 2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 2b clinical study were to determine the starting Phase 3 dose of LPCN 1111
along with safety and tolerability of LPCN 1111 and its metabolites following oral administration of single and multiple doses in hypogonadal
men. Good dose-response relationship was observed over the tested dose range in the Phase 2b study. Additionally, the target Phase 3
dose met primary and secondary end points. Overall, LPCN 1111 was well tolerated with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events
reported in the Phase 2b study. All future development and commercialization of LPCN 1111 in the Licensed Verity Territory will be the responsibility
of Verity Pharma. 

Oral
Programs for CNS Disorders 

Some
preferred endogenous or naturally occurring NAS present in the central nervous system act as positive allosteric modulators PAMs of the GABA A receptor, the major biological target of the inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid GABA A ).
To improve oral delivery of these modulators, several synthetic NAS derivatives of endogenous GABA A receptor PAMs have been
developed for therapeutic use in the past few decades. 

In
October 2024, we announced positive data from our qEEG study of our oral brexanolone with results indicating robust central nervous system
activity of oral brexanolone, with concentration- and time-dependent post-dose changes in qEEG as follows: 

Quantitative
 Electroencephalogram qEEG in healthy subjects administered single doses of
 oral brexanolone, a neuroactive steroid, confirmed GABAA modulation 

Rapid
 and durable CNS target engagement confirms effective oral delivery of bioidentical brexanolone 

Promising
 results support continued development of oral brexanolone for the treatment of neuropsychiatric
 disorders 

We
believe through utilization of our proprietary technology we may have the ability to enable effective oral delivery of endogenous GABA A
 receptor PAMs which historically had been deemed to be not orally bioavailable. As a novel drug class, NASs have received considerable
attention because of their potential to treat various neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, movement disorders, epilepsy,
anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. We have conducted Phase 1 pharmacokinetic PK studies for each of our three lead
NAS candidates which have demonstrated promising PK results, safety, and tolerability and we are evaluating additional undisclosed CNS-focused
candidates. 

LPCN
1154: Product Candidate for PPD 

Our
most advanced NAS candidate is LPCN 1154, a non-invasive, rapid onset, oral formulation of the neuroactive steroid brexanolone which
we are developing for the treatment of PPD. We have completed clinical oral PK studies including a pilot food effect study and
a pilot PK bridge study. In addition, as a prelude to a LPCN 1154 pivotal study, a multi-dose study was done confirming the dosing regimen
for the pivotal study using the scaled up to be marketed formulation required for New Drug Application NDA filing in accordance with the FDA s
feedback on our proposal for establishing the efficacy of LPCN 1154 through a pivotal PK bridge to an approved IV infusion brexanolone
via a 505(b)(2) NDA filing. In June 2024, we announced results from the pivotal PK study which demonstrated LPCN 1154 meets bioequivalence
with comparator, IV brexanolone, meeting standard bioequivalence criteria and C trough criteria. LPCN 1154 treatment was well-tolerated
with no sedation nor somnolence events observed in the pivotal study. 

We
have completed labeling studies such as a food effect study and PK profiling in women with PPD, and
are targeting NDA submission for LPCN 1154 by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.

PPD 

PPD,
a type of major depressive disorder with onset either during pregnancy or within four weeks of delivery, refers to depression persisting
up to 12 months after childbirth. PPD can be clinically segmented by the severity of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity, including
epilepsy. Approximately 1 in 8 mothers suffers from PPD in the United States alone; this equates to approximately 600,000 women being
affected by PPD annually. 

Disease
Overview - PPD 

PPD
 is distinct from the baby blues, a condition that up to 70 of all new mother s experience; baby blues 
 tend to be short-lived emotional conditions that do not interfere with daily activities. 

Symptoms
 of PPD include hallmarks of major depression, including, but not limited to, sadness, depressed mood, loss of interest, change in
 appetite, insomnia, sleeping too much, fatigue, difficulty thinking/concentrating, excessive crying, fear of harming the baby/oneself,
 and/or thoughts of death or suicide. 

During
 pregnancy, levels of endogenous NASs increase considerably along with levels of progesterone; however, they drop sharply postpartum.
 It has been hypothesized that the rapid perinatal decrease in circulating levels of endogenous NASs may be involved in the development
 of PPD. The first approved treatment option for PPD was an injectable containing endogenous NASs. 

Depression
 may persist long after child delivery. Additionally, approximately 40 of women relapse in subsequent pregnancies or on other occasions. 

Psychiatric
 comorbidities are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy are at high risk for major depressive disorders and PPD.
 Reported PPD rates are higher among women with epilepsy than the general population. 

Associated
Risk Factors 

Genetic:
 family history and/or previous experience of depression or other mood disorders 

Physiological:
 rapid changes in sex hormones, stress hormones, and thyroid hormone levels during and after delivery 

Environmental:
 stressful life events, changes in relationships at home and at work, and/or lack of familial support 

Unmet
Medical Need 

We
believe there is considerable unmet need within women with PPD due to a lack of convenient and fast-acting oral therapies. Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors SSRIs have been the traditional first-line choice for women with severe PPD and require
weeks for onset of efficacy; therefore, a need for an oral treatment option with a faster onset of action remains a significant unmet
need in treating PPD, especially in mothers with moderate to severe depression prone to harmful actions. 

Injectable
brexanolone (Zulresso , Sage Therapeutics) became the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression. However, numerous
factors limit the utilization of injectable brexanolone such as method of administration, cost, and safety concerns. In addition to Zulresso,
SAGE Therapeutics received FDA approval for zuranolone (brand name ZURZUVAE in August 2023 and Zurzuvae was launched commercially
in December 2023. Zuranolone, a synthetic neuroactive steroid derivative, is an oral, once daily 14-day treatment for postpartum depression
and is the first oral medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression. Per label, besides a long terminal half-life
of approximately 19.7 to 24.6 hours and dosage modifications needed for concomitant use with CYP3A4 modulators, warnings and precautions
include CNS depressant effects, impaired ability to drive or engage in other potentially hazardous activities and embryo-fetal toxicity. 

We
believe LPCN 1154 targets the current unmet need for robust, rapid relief with 48-hour dosing duration through a convenient oral therapy
candidate comprising bioidentical NASs with good tolerability. 

26 

LPCN
2101: NAS for Epilepsy 

We
are currently evaluating an additional NAS candidate, LPCN 2101, for women with epilepsy WWE ). We have completed pre-clinical
and Phase 1 studies for LPCN 2101 which demonstrated promising PK results, safety and tolerability. In July 2022 our IND was accepted
by the FDA for LPCN 2101 for adults with epilepsy and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 IND opening proof-of-concept study to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LPCN 2101, subject to resource prioritization. 

Disease
Overview Epilepsy 

Epilepsy
is defined by the 1) occurrence of at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart, 2) occurrence of one unprovoked seizure
and a probability of further seizures occurring over the next 10 years, and/or 3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Patients with epilepsy
have increased risk of mortality due to direct effects of seizures (e.g., status epilepticus, car accidents) and indirect effects of
seizures (e.g., suicide, cardiovascular effects). 

Epilepsy
is a disorder of the brain that causes seizures, affecting the physical, mental, and social well-being of persons, and is associated
with a 2 to 3 times greater mortality rate compared with the general population. About 60-65 of epilepsy is idiopathic and about 30 
of patients are refractory (i.e., epilepsy not well managed with currently available Anti-Seizure Medications ASMs ). Epilepsy
is the most common neurological disorder during pregnancy. 

It
is estimated that approximately 900,000 childbearing CB age women suffer from active epilepsy in the U.S. Women of CB
age with epilepsy face many additional challenges due to hormonal influences on seizure activity and endocrine function throughout the
different phases of their reproductive cycles. Elevated estrogen or decreased progesterone levels can exacerbate seizure frequency. Often,
these women experience hormonal and endogenous NAS imbalances, coupled with fluctuations in the blood levels of ASMs that impact control
of seizures, efficacy of oral contraceptives, any coexisting anxiety and/or depression and any associated sleep impairment. Epileptic
patients are 5-20 times more likely to develop depression. 

Clinical
segmentation can be categorized by epilepsy type, comorbidities and patient subgroups. Categorization of focal epilepsy, generalized
epilepsy, combined focal and generalized epilepsy, and unknown epilepsy can guide the choice of ASM. Special patient subgroups, including
WWE of CB age and elderly patients, require special care and management of epilepsy. Comorbidities such as depression and anxiety may
be co-treated with therapies that do not aggravate seizures and have no drug interaction with the ASM used for epilepsy. While lowest
effective dose and monotherapy are preferred, management of patients with epilepsy is focused on controlling seizures, avoiding adverse
events, and maintaining quality of life. Despite a wide range of ASMs available, about 30 of all people with epilepsy still fail to
respond to treatment effectively. Women with epilepsy face specific challenges throughout their lifespan because of seizures, ASMs, and
hormonal fluctuations. 

Women
with epilepsy were once counseled to avoid pregnancy, but epilepsy is no longer considered a contraindication to pregnancy. Caregivers
for WWE in the preconception phase either intending to start a family (planning pregnancy) or using contraception to prevent an unplanned
pregnancy face significant challenges to balance seizure control efficacy with the selection and dosage of ASMs and ASM-related risks
such as, among other risks, fetal-neonatal toxicity, contraception failure, and psychiatric side effects. 

Several
ASMs are known to have teratogenic effects on the developing fetus (converging evidence from registry studies indicates that teratogenic
risks are highest with valproate, followed by carbamazepine and topiramate). Other commonly prescribed ASMs, including older generation
agents, such as phenobarbital and phenytoin, have been associated with higher risks as compared with lamotrigine, levetiracetam, clonazepam
and gabapentin (Vajda et al., 2014; Voinescu and Pennell, 2015). Moreover, risks associated with ASMs are considerable early in pregnancy;
therefore, it is necessary that WWE of CB age undergo counseling, monitoring, and adjustment to the most appropriate ASM prior to becoming
pregnant. It is preferable that WWE of CB age discuss seizure control with their doctor for at least 6 months before conception and,
if possible, cease ASM therapy or use the lowest effective dose of a single anticonvulsant according to the type of epilepsy and the
fetal toxicity of the ASM. Anxiety, depression, lack of adherence to ASM, and/or contraception failure may be experienced by women who
are worried about unplanned pregnancy or are late in confirming pregnancy, planned or unplanned. ASMs can reduce the efficacy of oral
contraceptives, compounding this problem. 

Complex,
multidirectional interactions between female hormones, seizures, and ASMs exist. Most hormones act as NASs and can thus modulate brain
excitability. Any changes in endogenous or exogenous hormone levels can affect the occurrence of seizures, either directly or via PK
interactions that modify the plasma levels of ASMs (Harden, 2008). The PK interactions between oral contraceptives and ASMs are bidirectional
(Johnston and Crawford, 2014). The efficacy of hormonal contraception may be diminished for women taking CYP-P450 enzyme inducing ASMs.
Epilepsy is not a medical condition in which contraceptives are contraindicated. Contraceptive failure, possibly related to ASMs, may
be responsible for up to 1 in 4 unplanned pregnancies in WWE (~12.5 of all WWE pregnancies), versus a rate of 1 in healthy women. 

27 

Unmet
need to treat WWE in CB age 

It
is estimated that approximately 900,000 CB age women suffer from active epilepsy in the U.S. Women of CB age with epilepsy face many
additional challenges such as hormonal influences on seizure activity and endocrine function throughout the different phases of their
reproductive cycles, and approximately 30 of patients with epilepsy cannot be efficiently controlled with available ASMs making consideration
of newer pharmacological treatment development options important. 

Managing
uncontrolled seizures in WWE of CB age is the primary aim during preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum phases. Therefore, uncompromised
ASM efficacy with acceptable variability and less or no drug-drug interactions achieved with lowest possible monotherapy dose to address
fetal toxicity concerns remain highly unmet needs. Moreover, control of seizures including prevention of breakthrough seizures is critical
when planning for pregnancy and also during pregnancy, as it can also lead to undesired falls or auto-accidents and compromise freedom
to drive. 

Select
ASMs have the potential to induce contraception failures, reproductive hormone imbalance, anxiety, and depression. There remains an unmet
need for an ASM without the aforementioned downsides, with no to low fetal-neonatal toxicity and without breast-feeding concerns, as
well as the potential to treat associated comorbidities. 

While
over 30 molecules have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy in the U.S., no epilepsy drug has been specifically approved for WWE
of CB age. We believe our endogenous NASs as GABA A PAMs, while targeting the goal of seizure control, also have the potential
for additional benefits in psychiatric disorders comorbidities (e.g., anxiety and/or depression) and sleep impairment. Moreover, these
oral endogenous NASs could potentially address some of the fetal toxicity concerns related to unplanned or planned pregnancy in WWE.

LPCN
2203: Oral Product for Management of Essential Tremor 

LPCN
2203 is an oral candidate for management of essential tremor comprising a bioidentical GABA modulating NAS. We have successfully completed
oral pharmacokinetics with bioidentical GABA Modulating NAS and are planning to submit a protocol for a proof-of-concept phase 2 study
for ET to the FDA. 

Disease
Overview - Essential Tremor 

Essential
Tremor ET is one of the most common movement disorders in the United States, affecting an estimated 7 million in the
U.S. For ET patients, uncontrollable shaking of the hands, head, voice, or legs creates difficulty eating, dressing, writing, and pursuing
other day-to-day tasks. The etiology of ET is largely unknown, but reduced GABA A receptor levels and decreased GABAergic activity
have been observed in ET. 

While
ET is often associated with aging populations, ET can begin much earlier in life, with a progressive disease course that can eventually
necessitate a care partner. Social anxiety and depressive symptoms can manifest in patients with ET as tremor severity increases, and
may negatively impact a patient s ability to work and engage in hobbies. In an interview study of ET patients and care partners,
the most common impacts on activities of daily living are pouring liquids and writing/typing (100 and grooming/hygiene, drinking, dressing,
eating, and reading (80-85 ). Overall, 90 of participants noted the emotional impact of ET, with 75 reporting tremor-related worry
or anxiety. 

The
only FDA approved pharmacological treatment for ET was approved more than 50 years ago, and the majority of patients with ET experience
a sub-optimal response with standard-of-care treatments, highlighting numerous and compelling unmet needs in care such as daytime efficacy
and improved tolerability, a PRN (pro re nata) or as needed option, and a superior benefit-to-risk profile. (1) (2)

Other
Pipeline Candidates 

We
continue to pursue opportunities for partnering and/or development arrangements for the continued development and/or marketing of LPCN
2401, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144, and LPCN 1107. We do not currently anticipate conducting any further significant development activities with
respect to these products and product candidates without the participation of a partner. There can be no guarantee that we will be able
to identify or enter into partnering arrangements on terms that are beneficial to us or at all. Even if we do enter into partnering arrangements,
such arrangements may not be sufficient to successfully develop and commercialize these products. 

28 

LPCN
2401: For Improved Body Composition in Obesity Management 

LPCN 2401 is targeted to be a once daily oral formulation comprising a proprietary anabolic androgen receptor agonist, and LPCN 2401+E is a proprietary anabolic androgen receptor agonist co-formulated with Vitamin
E, an antioxidant metabolic modifier. LPCN 2401 is expected to have a
favorable benefit to risk profile as a non-invasive option for use as an adjunct to GLP-1 chronic weight management therapies and/or
as a monotherapy post cessation of GLP-1 chronic weight management therapies with demonstrated benefits to the liver. 

LPCN
2401 has potential for use as an adjunct to incretin mimetics (GLP-1/GIP agonists) including amplification of GLP-1 insulinotropic
actions which is supported by studies demonstrating the role of androgen receptor agonist in regulation of GLP-1 through: 

Enhancement
 of GLP-1-mediated insulin release from cells through genomic- and non-genomic mechanisms 

Increase
 in GLP-1 Receptor Expression in diabetics and non-diabetics 

Promoting
 proliferation of cells and improving insulin sensitivity 

Target
benefits of LPCN 2401 in combination with GLP-1 agonists include improved body composition with quality weight loss while attenuating
lean mass loss, a serious unmet need, in addition to quality fat loss through appreciable abdominal fat loss. Moreover, as an adjunct
to incretin mimetics, LPCN 2401 may increase weight loss, particularly in diabetics, through increased expression activity of GLP1R and
increased effectiveness of GIP1 therapies secondary to actions at GLP1R (glucose lowering). LPCN 2401 could also be potentially used
as monotherapy post discontinuation of GLP-1 agonist to manage weight/fat regain and durability of diabetes remission. 

Data
from preclinical and clinical studies support the potential of LPCN 2401 and LPCN 2401+E in improving body composition. In April 2024,
Lipocine announced results from a multi-center prospective, blinded Phase 2 study, which demonstrated increases in lean mass of 4.4 ,
decreases in fat mass of 6.7 , reduction in android fat of 4.1 and increased bone mineral content of 2.8 in a population consistent
with FDA guidance for developing products for weight management. LPCN 2401 was well tolerated with minimal GI or androgenic adverse events and no reports of muscle spasms. 

As an adjunct therapy to incretin mimetics, LPCN 2401 has the potential
to attenuate fat/weight rebound, ameliorate loss of muscle mass, improve muscle quality and functionality, amplify fat mass loss with improved
body composition, maintain weight, prevent fat overshoot, and accelerate muscle rebound post incretin mimetic discontinuation.
We plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the study design for a proof-of-concept phase 2 study for LPCN 2401 and expansion to the female
population. We may explore the possibility of partnering LPCN 2401 with a third party, although no partnering agreement has been entered
into by us. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such
an agreement would be on terms favorable to us. 

Disease
and Market Overview Obesity Management 

Approximately
74 of US adults aged 20 and older are either obese or overweight, and an estimated 30 of the US adult population has a BMI 30 kg/m 2 .
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing health risk defined by excess body fat. Excess body fat increases the risk of death and major comorbidities
such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis of the knee, sleep apnea, and some cancers 1 .
About 30 of overweight (BMI 25 kg/m 2) adults 2 have type 2 diabetes, 50 3 have
dyslipidemia, and 67 4 have hypertension. 

It
is estimated that the total GLP-1 users in the U.S. may reach 30 million (around 9 of the overall population) by
2030 5 . Reportedly, ~24M 6 obese elderly are most vulnerable to losing muscle mass. The rapid weight loss
observed with the currently approved chronic weight management GLP-1 receptor agonist medications includes unwanted lean mass loss,
up to 40 of the patient s total weight lost. Moreover, discontinuation of these therapies frequently results in a rapid
regain in weight. Loss of lean mass has multiple negative health implications including weakness/fatigue, lowered metabolism which
can cause a regain in fat mass, declines in neuromuscular function, potential effects on emotion and psychological states, and
increased risk of injury. 

Several
recent studies showed that body composition, especially lean body mass (muscle) may play an independent role in survival of patients
with diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (DH Lee and EL Giovannucci, Exp Biol Med. 2018). Therefore, a focus on body
composition in obesity management to sustainably lose fat mass while maintaining lean mass should be an essential goal. 

There
is a significant unmet need for an oral, efficacious, muscle preserving/gaining option for chronic obesity/weight management that ameliorates
the loss of lean mass associated with GLP-1/GIP agonist treatment, resulting in a higher quality weight loss. Moreover, there is a need
for a chronic long-term pharmacotherapy option to maintain weight upon cessation of incretin mimetic therapy, prevent fat/weight rebound
 overshoot and minimize lag in muscle recovery to prevent collateral fattening as well as improve the durability of any
achieved diabetes remission while on GLP-1.

LPCN
1148: Oral Product Candidate for the Management of Decompensated Cirrhosis 

We
are currently evaluating LPCN 1148 comprising testosterone laurate TL for the management of decompensated cirrhosis.
We believe LPCN 1148 targets unmet needs for cirrhosis subjects including improvement in the quality of life of patients while on the
liver transplant waiting list, prevention or reduction in the occurrence of new decompensation events such as OHE, and improvement in post liver transplant survival, including outcomes and costs. We are exploring the possibility
of partnering with a third party for the development and/or marketing of LPCN 1148, although no partnering agreement has been entered
into by the Company. No assurance can be given that any partnering agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that
such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us. 

We
conducted a Phase 2 proof of concept POC study (NCT04874350) in male subjects with cirrhosis to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of LPCN 1148 for the management of sarcopenia. The Phase 2 POC study was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled
study in male sarcopenic cirrhotic patients. Subjects were initially randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 arms. The treatment arm was an oral dose
of LPCN 1148, and the second arm was a matching placebo. There were no restrictions on patients with respect to background therapies,
including current standard of care, diet or exercise. The primary endpoint was a change in skeletal muscle index at week 24 with key
secondary endpoints including change in liver frailty index, rates of breakthrough OHE, and number of waitlist events, including all-cause
mortality. Total treatment was 52 weeks, with 24-week placebo-controlled treatment subjects receiving LPCN 1148 in the 28-week open-label
extension OLE phase of the study for the duration of the study through week 52. 

In
July 2023 we announced that the Phase 2 study met the study primary endpoint, increased skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI) relative to placebo
(P 

In
March 2024 we announced that 24-week L3-SMI increases were maintained through 52 weeks of LPCN 1148 intervention and that placebo patients
who switched to LPCN 1148 in the open label extension period of the study had increases in L3-SMI. Furthermore, fewer OHE events were observed in LPCN 1148 treated patients and time to first recurrent OHE event was longer for treated patients.
LPCN 1148 was well-tolerated, with AE rates and severities similar to placebo and fewer participants experienced serious or severe adverse
events when switched from placebo to LPCN 1148 and patients on therapy were hospitalized for fewer days. We plan to request a Type C
meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development plan for LPCN 1148. 

Disease
Overview Cirrhosis 

There
are over 2 million cases of cirrhosis worldwide, with over 500,000 people living with decompensated cirrhosis in the U.S. Non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease is the most rapidly increasing indication for liver transplant. 62 of those on the liver transplant LT waitlist are male and the economic burden (approximately 812,500/transplant) is high and continues to increase. Each year about half
of the approximately 17,000 people in U.S. on the LT waitlist undergo transplant, while nearly 3,000 patients either die or are removed
from the list because they were too sick to transplant. 

Liver
cirrhosis is defined as the histological development of regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands. Patients with cirrhosis typically
have a years-long silent, asymptomatic phase (compensated cirrhosis) until decreasing liver function and increasing portal pressure move
the patient into the symptomatic phase (decompensated cirrhosis). Transition to decompensated cirrhosis is marked by clinical events
including ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, and/or variceal hemorrhage. Decompensated subjects survive on average less than 2 years.
Common causes of liver cirrhosis include alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD ), chronic hepatitis
B and C, primary biliary cirrhosis PBC ), and primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC and some patients have
liver disease of unknown cause (cryptogenic). 

Common
complications in patients with cirrhosis may include: compromised liver function, portal hypertension, varices in GI tract with
internal bleeding, edema, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy HE ), compromised immunity with post-transplant acute rejection risk, high
sodium levels, increased bilirubin, low albumin level, insulin resistance with impaired peripheral uptake of glucose, depression,
accelerated muscle disorder in the form of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and frailty with compromised energetics, bone diseases (e.g.,
osteoporosis), high alkaline phosphatase ALP ), cachexia, malnutrition, weight loss (>5 ), symptoms of hypogonadism
such as abnormal hair distribution, anemia, sexual dysfunction, testicular atrophy, muscle wasting, fatigue, osteoporosis,
gynecomastia, inflammation with elevated cytokines, and infection risk leading to hospital admissions and possibly death.

HE,
a significant decompensation event in patients with cirrhosis, is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal systemic
shunting. Because the damaged liver cannot function normally (as in cirrhosis), neurotoxins such as ammonia are inadequately removed
from systemic circulation and travel to the brain, where they affect neurotransmission. This can cause episodes of HE, which may present
as alterations in consciousness, cognition, and behavior that range from minimal to severe. Overt HE occurs in 30 to 40 of patients
with cirrhosis at some point during the clinical course of their disease. As the burden of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is increasing,
the frequency of HE is also increasing. 

LPCN
1144: An Oral Prodrug of Bioidentical Testosterone Product Candidate for the Treatment of NASH 

We
are exploring the possibility of partnering with a third party for LPCN 1144, although no partnering agreement has been entered into
by the Company. No assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement is completed, that such an
agreement would be on terms favorable to us. 

Disease
Overview NASH 

NASH
is an advanced state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD that can progress to a cirrhotic liver or liver failure,
require liver transplant, and can result in hepatocellular carcinoma/ liver cancer, and death. Progression of NASH to end stage liver
disease is one of the leading causes of liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Importantly, beyond these critical conditions,
NASH and NAFLD patients additionally suffer heightened cardiovascular risk and die more frequently from cardiovascular events than from
liver disease. NAFLD/NASH is becoming more common due to its strong correlation with obesity and metabolic syndrome, including components
of metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. 20 to 30 of the U.S. population is estimated
to suffer from NAFLD, with a large proportion of that group, 15 to 20 , progressing to NASH, which lacks an effective therapy. NASH
is a silent killer that affects millions in the U.S. Diagnoses have been on the rise and are expected to increase dramatically in the
next decade. Approximately 50 of NASH patients are adult males. In men, especially with comorbidities associated with NAFLD/NASH, testosterone
deficiency has been associated with an increased accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance, which could be factors
contributing to NAFLD/NASH. There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of NASH although there are several drug candidates
currently under development with many having clinical failures to date. 

The
critical pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of NASH include reduced ability to handle lipids, increased
insulin resistance, injury to hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in response to hepatocyte injury. NASH patients have an excessive accumulation
of fat in the liver resulting primarily from a caloric intake above and beyond energy needs. A healthy liver contains less than 5 fat,
but a liver in someone with NASH can contain more than 20 fat. This abnormal liver fat contributes to the progression to NASH, a liver
necro-inflammatory state that can lead to scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for some, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. 

Current
Status 

We
have completed the LiFT Phase 2 clinical study in biopsy-confirmed non-cirrhotic NASH subjects. The LiFT clinical study
was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-arm study in biopsy-confirmed hypogonadal and
eugonadal male NASH subjects with grade F1-F3 fibrosis and a target NAFLD Activity Score 4 with a 36-week treatment period. The
 LiFT clinical study enrolled 56 biopsy confirmed NASH male subjects. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms (Treatment
A was a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent, Treatment B was a twice daily oral dose of 142 mg testosterone equivalent
formulated with 217 mg of d-alpha tocopherol equivalent, and the third arm was a twice daily matching placebo). 

The
primary endpoint of the LiFT clinical study was change in hepatic fat fraction via MRI-PDFF and exploratory liver fat/marker end
points post 12 weeks of treatment. Additionally, key secondary endpoints post 36 weeks of treatment included assessment of histological
change for NASH resolution and/or fibrosis improvement (biopsy) as well as liver fat data (MRI-PDFF). The LiFT clinical study
was not powered to assess statistical significance of any of the secondary endpoints. Other important endpoints included the following:
change in liver injury markers, anthropomorphic measurements, body composition including lean mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density,
lipids, insulin resistance and inflammatory/fibrosis markers; as well as patient reported outcomes. 

Treatments
with LPCN 1144 post 12 weeks of treatment in the LiFT study resulted in robust liver fat reduction, assessed by MRI-PDFF, and
showed improvement of liver injury markers with no observed tolerability issues. 

31 

Liver
biopsies were performed at baseline BL and after 36 weeks of treatment EOS ). Pre-specified biopsy analyses
included NASH Clinical Research Network CRN scoring as well as a continuous paired Paired Technique and
digital technique Digital Technique-Fibronest ). All biopsy analyses were performed on the same slides and the reads for
the three techniques were done independently. Analysis sets included the NASH Resolution Set (all subjects that have BL and EOS biopsy
with NASH at BL [NAS 4 with lobular inflammation score 1 and hepatocyte ballooning score 1 at BL] (n=37)), the Biopsy Set
(all subjects with baseline and EOS biopsies (n=44)), and the Safety Set (all randomized subjects (n=56)). 

Both
LPCN 1144 treatment arms met with statistical significance the pre-specified accelerated approval regulatory endpoint of NASH resolution
with no worsening of fibrosis based on NASH CRN scoring. Additionally, both treatment arms showed substantial improvement of the observed
NASH activity in steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning. 

During
the 36 weeks of treatment, LPCN 1144 was well tolerated with an overall safety profile comparable to placebo. Additionally, subjects
were given the option to have access to LPCN 1144 through an open label extension OLE study. The extension study enabled
the collection of additional data on LPCN 1144 for up to a total of 72 weeks of therapy, as well as data for 36 weeks of therapy for
those subjects on placebo in the LiFT study. Key results from the OLE study are as follows: 

LPCN
 1144 was well tolerated over 72-week exposure with no observed safety signals; 

Liver
 injury markers were reduced and maintained with extended LPCN 1144 treatment; and 

Observed
 liver histology improvements support further development. 

In
November 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to LPCN 1144 as a treatment for non-cirrhotic NASH. The Fast Track program is designed
to accelerate the development and expedite the review of products, such as LPCN 1144, which are intended to treat serious diseases and
for which there is an unmet medical need. 

We
had a written only response from the FDA for a LPCN 1144 Type C meeting with the FDA in January 2022 to discuss the development path
forward with LPCN 1144. The FDA acknowledged that the NDA submission of LPCN 1144 would be via the 505(b)2 regulatory pathway and agreed
that no additional non-clinical studies are needed to support an NDA submission. The FDA acknowledged that subjects in the LiFT study
achieved improvements in key components associated with NASH histopathology after 36-weeks of treatment with LPCN 1144 in adult males
and agreed that the proposed multicomponent primary surrogate endpoint is acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval
pathway. The FDA agreed that the proposed primary multicomponent surrogate endpoint, NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, is
acceptable for seeking approval under the accelerated approval pathway and the FDA recommended a Phase 3 trial with a study duration
of 72 weeks. In July 2022, Lipocine held an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for LPCN 1144 for NASH. The FDA recommended a Phase 2
dose ranging study be conducted to identify the optimal dose prior to conducting a pivotal study. The FDA agreed to the proposed unique
testosterone ester, testosterone laurate, for future clinical studies. 

LPCN
1107: An Oral Product Candidate for the Prevention of Preterm Birth PTB 

We
are exploring the possibility of partnering with a third party for the development and/or marketing of LPCN 1107, although no partnering
agreement has been entered into by us. No assurance can be given that any partnering agreement will be completed, or, if an
agreement is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us. 

We
believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate HPC product indicated for the
reduction of risk of PTB (delivery less than 37 weeks) in women with singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous
PTB. Prevention of PTB is a significant unmet need as approximately 11 of all U.S. pregnancies result in PTB, a leading cause of neonatal
mortality and morbidity. 

Current
Status 

We
have completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess
HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label,
4-period, 4-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose PK study in pregnant women with 3 dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the IM HPC
(Makena ). The study enrolled 12 healthy pregnant women (average age of 27 years) with a gestational age of approximately 16 to 19
weeks. Subjects received three dose levels of LPCN 1107 (400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, or 800 mg BID) in a randomized, crossover manner during
the first 3 treatment periods and then received 5 weekly injections of HPC during the fourth treatment period. During each of the LPCN
1107 treatment periods, subjects received a single dose of LPCN 1107 on Day 1 followed by twice daily administration from Day 2 to Day
8. Following completion of the 3 LPCN 1107 treatment periods and a washout period, all subjects received 5 weekly injections of HPC.
Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (Cavg0-24) were comparable or higher for all 3 LPCN 1107 doses
than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the 3 LPCN 1107 doses. Also, unlike the
injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all 3 LPCN 1107 doses within 7 days. 

32 

A
traditional PK/PD based Phase 2 clinical study in the intended patient population is not expected to be required prior to entering into
Phase 3. Therefore, based on the results of our multi-dose PK study we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting and subsequent guidance meetings
with the FDA to define a pivotal Phase 2b/3 development plan for LPCN 1107. We have completed a food effect study to characterize the
dosing regimen for the pivotal study and we have submitted a pivotal clinical study protocol to the FDA. 

The
FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine
for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user
fee when we file our NDA. 

Recent
Competition Update 

On
October 5, 2020, the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER proposed that Makena be withdrawn from
the market because the PROLONG trial failed to verify the clinical benefit of Makena and concluded that the available evidence does not
show Makena is effective for its approved use. 

The
CDER issued AMAG Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder at the time, a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing NOOH to withdraw approval
of Makena, for which AMAG Pharmaceuticals responded by requesting a hearing and providing detail on the company s position, recognizing
clinicians decade-long use of treatment with Makena and the public health implications of withdrawing approval. The FDA Commissioner
held a public hearing with Covis from October 17 through 19, 2022, which resulted in a 14-1 vote recommending removal of the product
from the market. On October 31, 2022, Covis approached the CDER and outlined a plan of orderly withdrawal which would set a withdrawal
timeframe sufficient for current patients to complete their courses of treatment. The CDER declined this proposal. On March 6, 2023,
Covis announced its plan to voluntarily withdraw Makena from the market and submitted a request to the CDER for a minimum 21-week wind-down.
On April 6, 2023, the FDA withdrew its approval of Makena and ordered the immediate withdrawal of Makena and several approved generic
versions of the drug, making it unlawful for the drug to be distributed in the U.S. The FDA stated that in light of the unmet need for
a treatment for preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes, it is imperative that the medical and scientific communities
increase their efforts to find effective treatments and stated their hope that the decision to withdraw Makena will help galvanize further
research. The FDA further stated their commitment to working together with patients, researchers, and drug developers to advance the
development of safe and effective therapies that are urgently needed as a treatment for the prevention of preterm birth. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

Revenue

To
date, we have not generated any revenues from product sales and do not expect to do so until our FDA approved product receives regulatory
approval outside the U.S. and Canada or until one of our product candidates receives approval from the FDA. Revenues to date have been
generated substantially from license fees, royalty and milestone payments and research support from our licensees. Since our inception
through September 30, 2024, we have generated 49.6 million in revenue under our various license and collaboration arrangements and from
government grants. We have entered into the Verity License Agreement, the SPC License Agreement, and the Pharmalink License Agreement
with the potential for revenue from future milestones, royalties and/or product sales, but we may never generate revenues from any of
our clinical or preclinical development programs or licensed products as we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing
any of these product candidates. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related personnel costs, fees paid to
external service providers such as contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, contractual obligations
for clinical development, clinical sites, manufacturing and scale-up for late stage clinical trials, formulation of clinical drug supplies,
and expenses associated with regulatory submissions. Research and development expenses also include an allocation of indirect costs,
such as those for facilities, office expense, and depreciation of equipment based on the ratio of direct labor hours for research and
development personnel to total direct labor hours for all personnel. We expense research and development expenses as incurred. Since
our inception, we have spent approximately 153.5 million in research and development expenses through September 30, 2024. 

33 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs as we develop our other product candidates, including our CNS product candidates, as well
as the development of any future pipeline product candidates. 

In
general, the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of uncertainties in clinical development,
including, among others: 

the
 number of sites included in the trials; 

the
 length of time required to enroll suitable subjects; 

the
 duration of subject follow-ups; 

the
 length of time required to collect, analyze and report trial results; 

the
 cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review; and 

potential
 changes by the FDA in clinical trial and NDA filing requirements. 

Future
research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion, including, among
others: 

the
 timing and outcome of regulatory filings and FDA reviews and actions for product candidates; 

our
 dependence on third-party manufacturers for the production of satisfactory finished products for registration and launch should regulatory
 approval be obtained on any of our product candidates; 

the
 potential for future license or co-promote arrangements for our product candidates, when such arrangements will be secured, if at
 all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our future plans and capital requirements; and 

the
 effect on our product development activities of actions taken by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. 

A
change of outcome for any of these variables with respect to the development of our product development candidates could mean a substantial
change in the costs and timing associated with these efforts, could require us to raise additional capital, and may require us to reduce
operations. 

Given
the stage of clinical development and the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development, manufacturing, and
regulatory approval process, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the time or cost to complete the development of LPCN 1154,
LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144, LPCN 1111, LPCN 1107 and other product candidates. Clinical development timelines,
the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations and results from our clinical trials may not
be favorable. If we are successful in progressing LPCN 1154, LPCN 2401. LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203 or other future product candidates into
later stage development, we will require additional capital. The amount and timing of our future research and development expenses for
these product candidates will depend on the pre-clinical and clinical success of both our current development activities and potential
development of new product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of such activities. We will continue
efforts to enter into partnership arrangements for the continued development and/or marketing of LPCN 1144, LPCN 1148, LPCN 2401, LPCN
1107, for the development and commercialization of TLANDO outside of the United States, Canada, South Korea, and the GCC countries and
LPCN 1111 outside of the United States and Canada. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses in the future as we complete on-going clinical studies, including
the studies for our CNS product candidates and as we conduct future clinical studies, including when and if we conduct Phase 2 clinical
studies with LPCN 2401 or our development product candidates and when and if we conduct Phase 3 clinical studies with LPCN 1144, LPCN
1148, and LPCN 1107. We are also exploring the possibility of licensing LPCN 1144, LPCN 1148, LPCN 2401 and LPCN 1107, although we have
not entered into a licensing agreement and no assurance can be given that any license agreement will be completed, or, if an agreement
is completed, that such an agreement would be on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital or obtain non-dilutive
financing, we may need to reduce research and development expenses in order to extend our ability to continue as a going concern. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, and outside consulting
services related to our executive, finance, business development and administrative support functions. Other general and administrative
expenses include rent and utilities, travel expenses, and professional fees for auditing, tax, legal, and various other services. 

34 

General
and administrative expenses also include expenses for the cost of preparing, filling and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining,
enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims. 

We
expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue as a public company. These fees include legal
and consulting fees, accounting and audit fees, director fees, directors and officers insurance premiums, fees for investor
relations services and enhanced business and accounting systems, litigation costs, professional fees and other costs. However, if we
are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to reduce general and administrative expenses in order to extend our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

Other
Income and Expense 

Other
income and expense consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities, imputed
interest on minimum royalties under the Antares Licensing Agreement in 2023, and losses (gains) on our warrant liability.

Revenue 

We
did not recognize any revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of variable consideration
for minimum guaranteed royalties of 3.1 million relating to the termination of the Antares License Agreement during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

The
decrease in research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023 consists of a 605,000 decrease in TLANDO related costs, a 448,000 decrease in contract research organization
expense and outside consulting costs related to the wind down of our LPCN 1148 study in 2024, a 296,000 decrease in costs related to
our LPCN 1154 clinical studies, offset by a 49,000 increase in personnel related costs, and a 6,000 increase in other research and
development related costs and supplies. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 1.0 million in each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Interest
and Investment Income 

The
decrease in interest and investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest and investment income
during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to somewhat lower cash and marketable investment securities balances, in addition
to no longer having imputed interest income on the Antares License Agreement contract asset in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

35 

Gain
(Loss) on Warrant Liability 

We
recorded gains of approximately 138,000 and 75,000 on warrant liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, related to the change in the fair value of outstanding common stock warrants issued in the November 2019 Offering. The
gain in 2024 resulted from a decrease in the fair value of warrants mainly due to a lower stock price, remaining life and interest rate
at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to the stock price and interest rate at the end of the second quarter of 2024. The gain
in 2023 resulted from a decrease in the fair value of warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2023 as compared to June 30, 2023, which
was primarily due to the decrease in our stock price at the end of the third quarter 2023 compared to the stock price at the end of the
second quarter of 2023. No common stock warrants from the November 2019 Offering were exercised during the either three or nine months
ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The warrants are classified as a liability due to a provision contained within the warrant agreement
which allows the warrant holder the option to elect to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the warrants as determined in
accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing model with certain defined assumptions upon a change of control. The warrant liability
will continue to fluctuate in the future based on inputs to the Black-Scholes model including our current stock price, the remaining
life of the warrants, the volatility of our stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the number of common stock warrants outstanding.

Revenue 

We
recognized revenue of 7.7 million primarily consisting of licensing revenue of 7.5 million received from our Verity License Agreement
and TLANDO royalty revenue of 206,000 from the Verity License Agreement and terminated Antares License Agreement during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. We recognized a non-cash revenue reversal of variable consideration for minimum guaranteed royalties of 3.1
million relating to the termination of the Antares License Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 offset by licensing
revenue of approximately 55,000 for payments received related to the Spriaso license agreement. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

The
decrease in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023 consists of an 2.6 million decrease in contract research organization expense and outside consulting costs related to the wind
down of our LPCN 1148 study in 2024, a 558,000 decrease in TLANDO related costs, a 87,000 decrease in personnel related costs, and
a 6,000 decrease in other research and development related costs. These decreases were offset by a 1.0 million increase in costs related
to our LPCN 1154 clinical studies and a 25,000 increase in LPCN 2401 development costs. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

The
increase in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 consists of an 834,000 increase in business development expenses, a 94,000 increase in corporate legal fees, and
a 23,000 increase in director fees, offset by a 204,000 decrease in corporate insurance expense, a 173,000 decrease in professional
fees related to our 2023 reverse stock split, a 134,000 decrease in various other administrative consulting fees, a 42,000 decrease
in personnel related costs, and a 40,000 decrease in travel related costs. 

36 

Interest
and Investment Income 

The
decrease in interest and investment income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest and investment income
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to somewhat lower cash and marketable investment securities balances, in addition
to no longer having imputed interest income on the Antares License Agreement contract asset in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gain
(Loss) on Warrant Liability 

We
recorded non-cash gains of approximately 14,000 and 200,000 on our warrant liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of outstanding common stock warrants issued in the November 2019 Offering.
The gain in 2024 resulted from a decrease in the fair value of warrants mainly due to the remaining life of the warrant and lower interest
rate at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to a lower stock price on December 31, 2023. The gain in 2023 was attributable to a
decrease in the fair value of warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to the decrease
in our stock price at the end of the third quarter 2023 compared to the stock price on December 31, 2022. No common stock warrants from
the November 2019 Offering were exercised during either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The warrants are classified as a liability due to a provision contained within the warrant agreement which allows the warrant holder
the option to elect to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the warrants as determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with certain defined assumptions upon a change of control. The warrant liability will continue to fluctuate in the
future based on inputs to the Black-Scholes model including our current stock price, the remaining life of the warrants, the volatility
of our stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the number of common stock warrants outstanding. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception, our operations have been primarily financed through sales of our equity securities, issuances of debt and payments received
under our license and collaboration arrangements. We have devoted our resources to funding research and development programs, including
discovery research, and preclinical and clinical development activities. We have incurred operating losses in most years since our inception
and we expect to continue to incur operating losses into the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of LPCN 1154,
LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203, and any other future product candidates, including continued research efforts. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 19.8 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities compared to 22.0
million at December 31, 2023. 

In
September 2024, we entered into the SPC License Agreement with SPC, pursuant to which we granted to SPC a non-transferable,
exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize our TLANDO product with respect to TRT in South Korea. Under the
terms of the SPC License Agreement, SPC paid us a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront fee in October 2024. We are eligible to
receive additional payments including a non-refundable, non-creditable payment in consideration for certain TLANDO product
inventory, marketing authorization and sales milestones, and we will supply TLANDO to SPC and receive a supply price. In addition,
we will receive royalties on net sales in the SPC Territory under the SPC License Agreement. Our ability to realize benefits from
the SPC License Agreement, including milestone, product sale and royalty payments, is subject to a number of risks. We may not
realize milestone, product sale or royalty payments in anticipated amounts, or at all. 

On
January 12, 2024, we entered into the Verity License Agreement with Verity Pharma, pursuant to which we granted to Verity Pharma an exclusive,
royalty-bearing, sublicensable right and license to develop and commercialize our TLANDO product with respect to TRT in the Licensed Verity Territory.
Upon execution of the Verity License Agreement in January 2024 and upon transition of the commercialization of TLANDO from Antares to
Verity Pharma in February 2024, Verity Pharma paid us initial payments of 2.5 million and 5 million, respectively. Verity Pharma has
also agreed to make additional payments to us of 2.5 million before January 1, 2025, and 1 million before January 1, 2026. The Verity
License Agreement also provides Verity Pharma with a license to develop and commercialize TLANDO XR (LPCN 1111), our potential next generation,
once daily oral product candidate for testosterone replacement therapy comprised of testosterone tridecanoate TT in the
U.S. and Canada. We are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to 259 million in the aggregate, depending on the achievement of
certain development milestones and sales milestones in a single calendar year with respect to all products licensed by Verity Pharma
under the Verity License Agreement. In addition, we receive tiered royalty payments at rates ranging from 12 up to 18 of net sales
of all products licensed to Verity Pharma in the Licensed Verity Territory. Our ability to realize benefits from the Verity License Agreement,
including milestone and royalty payments, is subject to a number of risks. We may not realize milestone or royalty payments in anticipated
amounts, or at all. 

On
March 6, 2017, we entered into a sales agreement Cantor Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor as sales agent pursuant to which we agreed to sell shares of our common stock, having registered up to 50.0 million for sale under the
Cantor Sales Agreement. 

37 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 0 and 32,110 shares of our common stock under the Cantor Sales Agreement.
On April 24, 2024, we terminated the Cantor Sales Agreement. From the inception of the Cantor Sales Agreement to the termination of the
agreement, we sold in aggregate 996,821 shares of our common stock for 33.5 million. 

On
April 26, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement (the A.G.P. Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners A.G.P. pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to
the amount we registered on an effective registration statement pursuant to which the offering is being made. We currently have
registered up to 10,616,169 of shares of common shares for sale under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement, pursuant to the Registration
Statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-275716) (the Form S-3 ), through A.G.P. as sales agent. A.G.P. may sell
our common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of
the Securities Act, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other existing trade market for our
common stock, in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to prevailing market
prices, or any other method permitted by law. A.G.P. will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading
and sales practices and applicable law and regulations to sell shares under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement. We will pay A.G.P. 3.0 of
the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement. In addition, we have also provided A.G.P.
with customary indemnification rights. 

Our
shares of common stock to be sold under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement will be sold and issued pursuant to the Form S-3, as amended, which
was previously declared effective by the SEC, and the related prospectus and one or more prospectus supplements. 

We
are not obligated to make any sales of our common stock under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement. The offering of common stock pursuant to the
A.G.P. Sales Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the A.G.P. Sales Agreement as permitted therein. We and A.G.P. may each
terminate the A.G.P. Sales Agreement at any time upon ten days prior notice. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had not sold any shares under the A.G.P. Sales Agreement. 

We
believe that our existing capital resources, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements
through at least November 7, 2025 which include on-going clinical studies for LPCN 1154, research and development activities, and compliance
with regulatory requirements. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect if additional activities are performed by us including new clinical studies for LPCN
2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144, and/or LPCN 1107. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources
to fund our projected operating requirements through at least November 7, 2025, we will need to raise additional capital at some point
through the equity or debt markets or through additional out-licensing activities, either before or after November 7, 2025, to support
our operations. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital as necessary, our ability to continue as a going concern will be
limited. Further, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements
for product development, regulatory compliance and clinical trial activities sooner than planned. In addition, our capital resources
may be consumed more rapidly if we pursue additional clinical studies for LPCN 1154, LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203, LPCN 1148, LPCN
1144, and/or LPCN 1107. Conversely, our capital resources could last longer if we reduce expenses, reduce the number of activities currently
contemplated under our operating plan or if we terminate, modify or suspend on-going clinical studies. We can raise capital pursuant
to the A.G.P. Sales Agreement but may choose not to issue common stock if our market price is too low to justify such sales in our discretion.
There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and, subject to approval by the FDA, commercialization of
our product candidates. There are numerous risks and uncertainties impacting our ability to enter into collaborations with third parties
to participate in the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We are unable to precisely estimate the
amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our anticipated or unanticipated clinical studies and
ongoing development efforts. All of these factors affect our need for additional capital resources. To fund future operations, we will
need to ultimately raise additional capital and our requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical studies, pre-clinical testing and other related activities for all of our
 product candidates, including LPCN 1154, LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203, LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144, and LPCN 1107; 

the
 cost of manufacturing clinical supplies and establishing commercial supplies, of our product candidates and any products that we
 may develop; 

the
 cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if any; 

the
 terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, settlement and other arrangements that we may establish; 

the
 number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 

38 

the
 cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals; 

the
 timing, receipt and amount of sales, profit sharing, milestones or royalties, if any, from our potential products; 

the
 cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the
 extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements
 relating to any of these types of transactions; and 

the
 extent to which we grow significantly in the number of employees or the scope of our operations. 

Funding
may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Also, market conditions may prevent us from accessing the debt and equity capital
markets, including sales of our common stock through the A.G.P. Sales Agreement. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed,
we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our clinical studies, research and development programs or, if any
of our product candidates receive approval from the FDA, commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital
through a combination of public or private equity offerings, including the Sales Agreement, debt financings, collaborations, strategic
alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. These arrangements may not be available to us or
available on terms favorable to us. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, other
collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product
candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will
be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences, warrants or other terms that adversely affect
our stockholders rights or further complicate raising additional capital in the future. If we raise additional capital through
debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable, for any reason, to raise needed capital, we will have to
reduce costs, delay research and development programs, liquidate assets, dispose of rights, commercialize products or product candidates
earlier than planned or on less favorable terms than desired or reduce or cease operations. 

Sources
and Uses of Cash 

The
following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

respectively. 

Net
cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to cash required to support
ongoing operations, including research and development expenses primarily related to our LPCN 1154 clinical studies and manufacturing
scale up in addition to general and administrative expenses, offset by cash provided by the Verity License Agreement of 7.5 million.
Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to cash outlays to
support ongoing operations, including research and development expenses primarily related to our LPCN 1154 clinical studies, our LPCN
1148 Phase 2 POC study in male subjects with cirrhosis, and TLANDO manufacturing capabilities in addition to general and administrative
expenses. 

Net
Cash from Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 1.7 million and 10.4
million, respectively. 

39 

Net
cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was primarily the result
of the maturities of marketable investments securities, net. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 80,000 and 4,000, respectively. 

Net
Cash from Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 209,000 and 410,000,
respectively. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted primarily from the sale of 32,110
shares of common stock at a weighted average price of 6.77 per share, less costs associated with the Cantor Sales Agreement. Net
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to the sale of 81,000 shares of
our common stock at a weighted average price of 5.36 per share, less costs associated with the Cantor Sales Agreement. 

Contractual
Commitments and Contingencies 

Purchase
Obligations 

We
enter into contracts and issue purchase orders in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials
and clinical and commercial supply manufacturing and with vendors for pre-clinical research studies, research supplies and other services
and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and are cancellable obligations. 

Operating
Leases 

In
August 2004, we entered into an agreement to lease our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah consisting of office and laboratory space which
serves as our corporate headquarters. On January 24, 2024, we modified and extended the lease through February 28, 2025. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our financial statements,
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We concluded that licensing
revenue recognized in conjunction with the Verity License Agreement met
the requirements under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and,
if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. License revenue from payments to be received in the
future will be recognized when it is probable that we will receive license payments under the terms of the Verity License Agreement,
the SPC License Agreement or the Pharmalink License Agreement (see Footnote 13 Subsequent Events for disclosure regarding the SPC License Agreement and the Pharmalink
License Agreement). 

There
have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Accounting
Standards Issued Not Adopted 

In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic
280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reporting requirements under Topic 280. The enhanced disclosure
requirements include: title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), significant segment expenses provided to the CODM,
extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarifying single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety,
and permitting more than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain circumstances. This change is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply retrospectively
to all periods presented. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the financials statements of the
Company.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are exposed to various market risks, which include potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as
interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s market risk during the first nine months of 2024. For a discussion of the Company s
exposure to market risk, refer to the Company s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures within the meaning of Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures, Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our Disclosure Controls, which was done under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Principal Financial Officer. Based on the controls evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the
most recent fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Please
refer to Note 10 Commitments and Contingences to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained
in this report for certain information regarding our legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or
other material legal proceedings. We may, from time to time, be involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course
of business activities, and, while the Company has insurance that covers claims of this nature, unfavorable resolution of any of
these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, consider the risk factors discussed in Part 1,
 Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, risk factors discussed in Item 1A of the 2024 March Form
10-Q, risk factors discussed in Item 1A of the 2024 June Form 10-Q, and the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in the
aforementioned reports are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the
Company or that it currently deems to be not material also may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial
condition, and/or operating results. 

The
following are the risk factors that have materially changed from our risk factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K: 

41 

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry 

LPCN
2401 is in a very early stage of development and may not be further developed for a variety of reasons. 

LPCN
2401 is in a very early stage of development and consequently the risk that we may fail to develop, commercialize, or partner LPCN 2401
and related products is high. This development program is susceptible to technical failures in future clinical studies and regulatory
hurdles for further testing and/or meeting the FDA s needs for NDA filing or approval. The result of a possible POC Phase 2 study
may not be indicative of ultimate success in a larger Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical study and, although we are exploring the possibility
of partnering LPCN 2401 with a third party for further development and commercialization, we may not be able to identify potential partners
or successfully enter into partnership arrangements on terms favorable to us, if at all. We may
not be able to further test in-clinic in a timely manner or at all due to other regulatory hurdles. In addition, LPCN 2401 in combination
with incretin mimetics may not be effective in achieving weight loss and improving body composition or may not have differentiation from
competitive products on the market or in development. Pending resource availability, we may expend significant resources before determining
that these programs are not viable candidates for regulatory approval and commercialization. 

LPCN
1154 is in development and an NDA submission may not be filed as planned, or if filed, accepted by the FDA. 

LPCN
1154 is currently in development, and we plan to file NDA in 2024. There can be no assurance as to whether the results of the
clinical trials or whether the planned NDA submission will be accepted for review or approved by the FDA for postpartum depression,
including, the oral route related brexanolone or its metabolites exposure profile relative to the reference injectable
brexanolone. Although we have an agreement with the FDA on a 505(b)(2) pathway to NDA submission, we may be required to undertake
additional clinical studie(s) including studies in the patient population since our pivotal study was conducted in post-menopausal
women. 

LPCN
1154 may not achieve planned commercialization or commercialization objectives for a variety of reasons. 

Commercialization
of LPCN 1154 is likely highly dependent on us finding a partner to market and sell LPCN 1154, if approved. We are exploring the
possibility of partnering LPCN 1154 to a third party for commercialization, however we may not be able to identify potential
partners or successfully enter into partnership arrangements on terms favorable to us, if at all. We cannot be certain as to whether
label language required by the FDA will require warnings, blackbox or otherwise, as to the safety or efficacy of LPCN 1154 which
could negatively effect the commercialization of the LPCN 1154, if approved. If we are unable to successfully partner or otherwise
develop and get a regulatory approval for LPCN 1154, LPCN 1154 may never be commercialized. 

Our
current LPCN 1154 505 (b)(2) filing strategy includes referencing injectable brexanolone (Zulresso) as a listed drug. There can be no
assurance there will not be any third party patent infringement proceedings against us. 

We
rely on third party vendors for our supply of brexanolone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of LPCN 1154, and on a third-party manufacturer
for the development and supply of commercial drug product of LPCN 1154. The loss of these third-party vendors could harm the commercialization
of LPCN 1154. 

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

The
value of our warrants outstanding from the November 2019 Offering is subject to potential material increases and decreases based on fluctuations
in the price of our common stock, among other factors. 

In
November 2019, we completed a public offering of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock (the November 2019 Offering ).
Gross proceeds from the November 2019 Offering were approximately 6.0 million. In the November 2019 Offering, the Company sold (i) 614,706
Class A Units, with each Class A Unit consisting of one share of common stock and a common stock warrant to purchase one share of common
stock, and (ii) 91,177 Class B Units, with each Class B Unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock
and one common stock warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a price of 8.50 per Class A Unit and 8.4998 per Class B Unit.
The pre-funded warrants were issued in lieu of common stock in order to ensure the purchaser did not exceed certain beneficial ownership
limitations. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.0017 per share, subject to adjustment. Additionally,
the common stock warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 8.50 per share and expire on November 17, 2024. As of
September 30, 2024, there were 64,362 warrants from the November 2019 offering outstanding. 

42 

We
account for the common stock warrants as a derivative instrument, and changes in the fair value of the warrants are included under other
income (expense) in the Company s statements of operations for each reporting period. On September 30, 2024, the aggregate fair
value of the warrant liability included in the Company s consolidated balance sheet was approximately 4,000. We use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to determine the fair value of the warrants. As a result, the option-pricing model requires the input of several
assumptions, including the stock price volatility, share price and risk-free interest rate. Changes in these assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate. While the liability may only result from a change of control at that point in time, we ultimately may
incur amounts significantly different than the carrying value. 

Our
management and directors will be able to exert influence over our affairs. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 6.2 of our common stock. These stockholders,
if they act together, may be able to influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including significant
corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might affect
the market price of our common stock. 

The
market price of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and may continue to be volatile. 

The
market price and trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and it may continue to be volatile. Over the
past year, our common stock has traded as low as 2.36 and as high as 10.69 per share. We cannot predict the price at which our common
stock will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be
influenced by many factors, including our financial results; developments generally affecting our industry; general economic, industry
and market conditions, and our customers; the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock; investor perceptions of our business;
reports by industry analysts; announcements by other market participants, including, among others, investors, our competitors, and our
customers; regulatory action affecting our business; and the impact of other Risk Factors discussed herein and in our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, changes in the trading price of our common stock may be inconsistent
with our operating results and outlook. The volatility of the market price of our common stock may be inconsistent with our operating
results and outlook. The volatility of the market price of our common stock may adversely affect investors ability to purchase
or sell shares of our common stock. 

Risks
Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements 

We
have incurred significant operating losses in most years since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the
foreseeable future. 

We
have focused a significant portion of our efforts on developing TLANDO and more recently on LPCN 1154, LPCN 1148, and LPCN 1144. We have
funded our operations to date through sales of our equity securities, debt and payments received under our license and collaboration
arrangements. We have incurred losses in most years since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 201.6
million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs
and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. These losses, combined with expected future losses, have had
and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity. We expect to continue to incur significant research and
development expenses in connection with clinical trials associated with LPCN 1154, and potentially with LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203,
LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144 and LPCN 1107, if further clinical trials are initiated. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant
operating losses for the foreseeable future as we evaluate further clinical development of LPCN 1154, LPCN 2401, LPCN 2101, LPCN 2203,
and possibly LPCN 1148, LPCN 1144, and LPCN 1107, in addition to our other programs and continued research efforts. Because of the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses
or when we will become profitable, if at all.
