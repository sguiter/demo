 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation those statements that are identified by the words anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts and similar expressions, and include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical facts. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions which we believe are reasonable based on current expectations and projections about future events and industry conditions and trends affecting our business. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that, among other things, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the risk factors described in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports that we file with the SEC from time to time, and the following: 
 
 Our ability to obtain adequate cost recovery for our utility operations through regulatory proceedings and favorable rulings on periodic applications to recover costs for capital additions, plant retirements and decommissioning, fuel, transmission, purchased power and other operating costs, and the timing in which new rates would go into effect; 

Our ability to complete our capital program in a cost-effective and timely manner; 

Our ability to execute on our strategy; 

Our ability to successfully execute our financing plans; 

The effects of changing interest rates; 

Our ability to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction goals; 

Board of Directors approval of any future quarterly dividends; 

The impact of future governmental regulation; 

Our ability to overcome the impacts of supply chain disruptions on availability and cost of materials; 

The effects of inflation and volatile energy prices; 

Our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs and whether such coverage will protect us against significant losses; and 

Other factors discussed from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 

New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements emerge from time-to-time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, or the extent to which any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We assume no obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, ASU 2024-03 
 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , which requires public entities to disclose, in the notes to financial statements, certain costs and expenses, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, and costs related to depreciation and amortization. ASU 2024-03 is effective for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2027, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect ASU 2024-03 to have an impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; however, are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

million of our 2023 generated PTCs. We elected to account for the net proceeds from the transfer of PTCs as a reduction to income taxes payable under the scope of ASC 740 Income Taxes . We included the discount from the sale of our tax credits as a component of income tax expense. This sale of tax credits is presented within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid. We expect to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize our tax credits through third party transferability agreements. We will also include any expected proceeds from the sale of tax credits in the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets related to PTCs. IRS Revenue Procedure 2023-15 On April 14, 2023, the IRS released Revenue Procedure 2023-15 Amounts paid to improve tangible property . The Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether costs to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized. The Revenue Procedure may be adopted in tax years ending after May 1, 2023. We intend to elect the safe harbor for tax year 2024. We do not expect the Revenue Procedure to have a material impact on our tax repairs deduction. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) and Effective Tax Rates Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Income tax (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was million compared to million reported for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was compared to for the same period in 2023.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Income tax (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was million compared to million reported for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was which compared to for the same period in 2023 .

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussions should be read in conjunction with the Notes contained herein and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 We are a customer-focused energy solutions provider with a mission of Improving Life with Energy for more than 1.3 million customers and 800+ communities we serve. Our aspiration is to be the trusted energy partner across our growing eight-state footprint, including Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Our strategy is centered on four critical priorities: Growth to grow strategically and achieve strong financial performance, Operational Excellence delivering safe, reliable and cost-effective energy to meet our customers needs, Transformation be a simple and connected company positioned for growth, and People Culture retain and attract a talented, engaged and thriving team. 
 
 We conduct our business operations through two operating segments: Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities. Certain unallocated corporate expenses that support our operating segments are presented as Corporate and Other. We conduct our utility operations under the name Black Hills Energy predominantly in rural areas of the Rocky Mountains and Midwestern states. We consider ourself a domestic electric and natural gas utility company. 
 
 We have provided energy and served customers for 140 years, since the 1883 gold rush days in Deadwood, South Dakota. Throughout our history, the common thread that unites the past to the present is our commitment to serve our customers and communities. By being responsive and service focused, we can help our customers and communities thrive while meeting rapidly changing customer expectations. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Environmental Matters - Power Plant Greenhouse Gas Regulations 
 
 In April 2024, the EPA published final rules addressing control of CO 2 emissions from the power sector. The rules regulate new natural gas generating units and provide emission guidelines for existing coal and certain natural gas generation. The rules create subcategories of coal units based on planned retirement date and subcategories of natural gas combustion turbines and combined cycle units based on utilization. The CO 2 control requirements vary by subcategory. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules through our integrated resource plans and believe that costs incurred as a result of the new rules will be recoverable through our regulatory mechanisms. 
 
 Business Segment Recent Developments 
 
 Electric Utilities 
 
 See Note 2 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent rate review activity for Colorado Electric. 

South Dakota Electric continues to pursue adding 100 MW of utility-owned, dispatchable natural gas generation by the second half of 2026. During the first quarter of 2025, South Dakota Electric expects to file for a permit to construct the project in South Dakota and request a CPCN in Wyoming. 

Wyoming Electric continues construction on Ready Wyoming, which is on schedule and expected to be completed in multiple segments in 2024 and 2025. 

On July 11, 2024, Wyoming Electric announced its partnership with Meta to provide power for its newest AI data center to be constructed in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Wyoming Electric will serve Meta under its Large Power Contract Service tariff and will procure customized energy resources essential to Meta's operations and sustainability objectives. 

On April 17, 2024, Colorado Electric filed its 120-Day report with the CPUC recommending the addition of renewable energy resources to advance its Clean Energy Plan. The final composition of resources and timing is subject to review and approval by the CPUC, which is expected later this year. 

On January 11, 2024, Wyoming Electric set a new all-time and winter peak load of 314 MW, surpassing the previous winter peak of 301 MW set on December 26, 2023, and all-time peak of 312 MW set on July 24, 2023.

 See Note 2 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent rate review activity for Arkansas Gas, Colorado Gas, Iowa Gas, and Wyoming Gas. 

In January 2024, Black Hills Energy Renewable Resources acquired a RNG production facility at a landfill in Dubuque, Iowa. The facility currently injects RNG into the natural gas distribution system serving Dubuque, which is owned and operated by Iowa Gas. This acquisition represents our entry into the production of RNG as a non-regulated business while leveraging our expertise in owning and operating regulated natural gas pipeline systems, including RNG interconnections. The RNG produced from the landfill facility captures methane that would otherwise vent into the atmosphere. It is delivered under long-term contracts to a third party that purchases the RNG and its related environmental attributes, in conformity with the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard Program.

During the second quarter of 2024, we published our 2023 Corporate Sustainability Report, highlighting our environmental, social and governance impacts and our progress on major projects and climate goals. We reported a 27 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas distribution system since 2022 and are on track to achieve our goal of net zero emissions by 2035. Additionally, we have reduced our electric utility greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one-third since 2005 and are on track to achieve our goals to reduce electric emissions intensity by 40 by 2030 and 70 by 2040 compared to 2005. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Certain lines of business in which we operate are highly seasonal, and revenue from, and certain expenses for, such operations may fluctuate significantly among quarterly periods. Demand for electricity and natural gas is sensitive to seasonal cooling, heating and industrial load requirements. In particular, the normal peak usage season for our Electric Utilities is June through August while the normal peak usage season for our Gas Utilities is November through March. Significant earnings variances can be expected between the Gas Utilities segment s peak and off-peak seasons. Due to this seasonal nature, our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and our financial condition as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and financial condition to be expected as of or for any other period or for the entire year. 
 
 All amounts are presented on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise indicated. Minor differences in amounts may result due to rounding.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023: 
 
 The variance to the prior year included the following: 
 
 Electric Utilities operating income decreased 17.9 million primarily due to higher operating expenses and unfavorable impacts from current year unplanned generation outages partially offset by new rates and rider recovery; and prior-year one-time benefits from a gain on sale of land to support data center growth and a recovery from our business interruption insurance; 

Gas Utilities operating income decreased 4.5 million primarily due to higher operating expenses partially offset by new rates and rider recovery driven by the Colorado Gas, Iowa Gas, RMNG and Wyoming Gas rate reviews; 

Net interest expense increased 4.2 million primarily due to higher interest rates partially offset by increased interest income; and 

Income tax expense decreased 4.5 million primarily driven by lower pre-tax income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023: 
 
 The variance to the prior year included the following: 
 
 Electric Utilities operating income decreased 14.7 million primarily due to higher operating expenses and unfavorable impacts from current year unplanned generation outages partially offset by new rates and rider recovery; and prior-year one-time benefits from a gain on the sale of Northern Iowa Windpower assets, a gain on sale of land to support data center growth, and a recovery from our business interruption insurance; 

Gas Utilities operating income increased 16.9 million primarily due to new rates and rider recovery driven by the Colorado Gas, Iowa Gas, RMNG and Wyoming Gas rate reviews and retail customer growth and usage partially offset by higher operating expenses and unfavorable weather; 

Net interest expense increased 5.9 million primarily due to higher interest rates partially offset by increased interest income; 

Income tax expense increased 7.6 million driven by a higher effective tax rate primarily due to a prior-year 8.2 million tax benefit from a Nebraska income tax rate decrease; and 

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased 2.6 million due to lower net income from Colorado IPP primarily driven by an unplanned generation outage.

Segment Operating Results 
 
 A discussion of operating results from our business segments follows. Unless otherwise indicated, segment information does not include inter-segment eliminations. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and a non-GAAP financial measure", Electric and Gas Utility margin. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Electric and Gas Utility margin (revenue less cost of sales) is a non-GAAP financial measure due to the exclusion of operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and property and production taxes from the measure. 
 
 Electric Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of fuel and purchased power. Gas Utility margin is calculated as operating revenue less cost of natural gas sold. Our Electric and Gas Utility margin is impacted by the fluctuations in power and natural gas purchases and other fuel supply costs. However, while these fluctuating costs impact Electric and Gas Utility margin as a percentage of revenue, they only impact total Electric and Gas Utility margin if the costs cannot be passed through to our customers. 
 
 Our Electric and Gas Utility margin measure may not be comparable to other companies Electric and Gas Utility margin measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.

(a) In 2021, Wygen I experienced an unplanned outage which resulted in lost revenue. A claim for these losses was submitted under our business interruption insurance policy. During the third quarter of 2023, we recovered 5.0 million from our business interruption insurance which was recognized as Revenue. 

Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to a prior-year 3.9 million gain on sale of land, 3.2 million of costs related to unplanned generation outages, 1.6 million of higher office, facility and IT-related expenses, 1.4 million of higher insurance expense and 1.1 million of higher employee costs. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a higher asset base driven by current year and prior year capital expenditures. 
 
 Taxes - property and production was comparable to the same period in the prior year.

During the third quarter of 2023, we recovered 5.0 million from our business interruption insurance which was recognized as Revenue. 

Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to a prior-year one-time 7.7 million gain on the sale of Northern Iowa Windpower assets, a prior-year 3.9 million gain on sale of land, 4.2 million of costs related to unplanned generation outages and 3.0 million of higher insurance expense, partially offset by 2.1 million of lower employee-related expenses driven by lower headcount. Other favorable variances, none of which were individually significant, comprised the remainder of the difference when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a higher asset base driven by current year and prior year capital expenditures. 
 
 Taxes - property and production was comparable to the same period in the prior year.

(a) Renewable energy purchases increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to new wind and solar energy PPAs. In 2022, Wyoming Electric entered into two new PPAs with third parties to purchase up to 106 MW of wind energy and up to 150 MW of solar energy, upon construction of new renewable generation facilities (owned by third parties). The new wind generation facility was placed in service in December 2023 and the solar facility was placed in service in March 2024. The renewable energy from these PPAs is used to serve our expanding partnerships with data centers.

 Interest expense, net increased primarily due to higher interest rates partially offset by increased interest income. 
 
 Other income (expense), net was comparable to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Income tax (expense) increased primarily due to a higher effective tax rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was 11.4 compared to 7.6 for the same period in 2023. The higher effective tax rate was primarily driven by a prior-year 8.2 million tax benefit from a Nebraska income tax rate decrease.

 Net cash provided by operating activities was 189.9 million lower than the same period in 2023. The variance to the prior year was primarily attributable to: 
 
 Total earnings (net income plus non-cash adjustments) were 34.2 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased Electric and Gas Utility margins driven by new rates and increased rider revenues. 

Net inflows from changes in certain operating assets and liabilities were 224.3 million lower, primarily attributable to: 

Cash inflows decreased by 211.5 million as a result of changes in materials, supplies, fuel, accounts receivable, and other current assets primarily driven by fluctuations in commodity prices and weather conditions; 

Cash outflows decreased by 124.7 million as a result of changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by fluctuations in commodity prices, payment timing of natural gas and power purchases, and changes in other working capital requirements; and 

Cash inflows decreased by 137.5 million as a result of changes in our regulatory assets and liabilities primarily due to lower recoveries of deferred gas and fuel cost adjustments driven by fluctuations in commodity prices and lower recoveries of Winter Storm Uri costs from customers.

Exhibit 95 
 
 Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Sections 1503(a) of Dodd-Frank is included below. 
 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration Safety Data 
 
 Safety is a core value at Black Hills Corporation and at each of its subsidiary operations. We have in place a comprehensive safety program that includes extensive health and safety training for all employees, site inspections, emergency response preparedness, crisis communications training, incident investigation, regulatory compliance training and process auditing, as well as an open dialogue between all levels of employees. The goals of our processes are to eliminate exposure to hazards in the workplace, ensure that we comply with all mine safety regulations, and support regulatory and industry efforts to improve the health and safety of our employees along with the industry as a whole. 
 
 Under the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act, each operator of a coal or other mine is required to include certain mine safety results in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our mining operation, consisting of Wyodak Coal Mine, is subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). Below we present the following information regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the three month period ended September 30, 2024. In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The information presented includes: 
 
 Total number of violations of mandatory health and safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which we have received a citation from MSHA; 

Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act; 

Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health and safety standards under section 104(d) of the Mine Act; 

Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act; and 

Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act. 

The table below sets forth the total number of citations and/or orders issued by MSHA to BHE Wyodak Mine under the indicated provisions of the Mine Act, together with the total dollar value of proposed MSHA assessments received during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, together with the Administrative Law Judges thereof, for BHE Wyodak Mine, our only mining complex. All citations were abated within 24 hours of issue.
