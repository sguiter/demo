 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
 September 30, 2024 

In fulfilling the Company s obligation to transport freight from a specified origin to a specified destination, control of freight is transferred to us at the point it has been loaded into the driver s trailer, the doors are sealed and the driver has signed a bill of lading, which is the basic transportation agreement that establishes the nature, quantity and condition of the freight loaded, the responsibility for invoice payment and the pickup and delivery locations. Our revenue is generated, and our customers receive benefit, as the freight progresses towards delivery locations. In the event our customer cancels the shipment at some point prior to the final delivery location and re-consigns the shipment to an alternate delivery location, we are entitled to receive payment for services performed for the partial shipment. Shipments are generally conducted over a relatively short time span, generally one to three days; however, freight is sometimes stored temporarily in our trailer at one of our drop yard locations or at a location designated by a customer. Our revenue is categorized as either Freight Revenue or Fuel Surcharge Revenue, and both are earned by performing the same freight transportation services, as discussed further below. 
 
 Freight Revenue revenue generated by the performance of the freight transportation service, including any accessorial service, provided to customers. 
 
 Fuel Surcharge Revenue revenue designed to adjust freight revenue rates to an agreed-upon base cost for diesel fuel. Diesel fuel prices can fluctuate widely during the term of a contract with a customer. At the point that freight revenue rates are negotiated with customers, a sliding scale is agreed upon that approximately adjusts diesel fuel costs to an agreed-upon base amount. In general, as fuel prices increase, revenue from fuel surcharge increases, so that diesel fuel cost is adjusted to the approximate base amount agreed upon. 
 
 Revenue is recognized over time as the freight progresses towards its destination and the transportation service obligation is fulfilled. For loads picked up during the reporting period but delivered in a subsequent reporting period, revenue is allocated to each period based on the transit time in each period as a percentage of total transit time. There are no assets or liabilities recorded in conjunction with revenue recognized, other than accounts receivable and estimated credit losses.

The following table sets forth the gross unrealized gains and losses on the Company s marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Gross unrealized losses

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized dividend income of approximately in non-operating income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized dividend income of approximately in non-operating income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The Company s equity securities are periodically used as collateral against any outstanding margin account borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under its margin account, which is no change from December 31, 2023, when the Company had outstanding borrowings under the same account. Margin account borrowings are used for the purchase of marketable equity securities and as a source of short-term liquidity and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Our marketable equity securities portfolio had a net unrealized pre-tax gain in market value of approximately during the third quarter of 2024, and a net unrealized pre-tax gain in market value of approximately during the third quarter of 2023, which were reported as non-operating income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods. 

shares were reserved for the issuance of stock awards to directors, officers, key employees, and others. The stock option exercise price and the restricted stock value under the Plan shall not be less than of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the award is granted. The fair market value is determined by the closing price of the Company s common stock, on its primary exchange, on the same date that the option or award is granted. This Plan expired on March 13, 2024, and no further grants may be made under the Plan. All outstanding unvested awards granted under the Plan, however, remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. On February 15, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors adopted a new 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ), under which shares are reserved for issuance of stock awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company. The 2024 Plan is subject to and will become effective upon approval by the Company s shareholders at its upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. 
 
 During May 2024, the Company issued unrestricted shares of common stock to non-employee directors. These shares had a grant date fair value of per share, based on the closing price of the Company s stock on the date of issuance. 
 
 The total grant date fair value of stock vested during the first nine months of 2024 was approximately . The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense, recognized in salaries, wages and benefits during the first nine months of 2024, was approximately and includes approximately recognized as a result of the issuance of shares to certain non-employee directors. The recognition of stock-based compensation expense decreased both diluted and basic earnings per common share by approximately during the first nine months of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had stock-based compensation plans with total unvested stock-based compensation expense of approximately , which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. As a result, the Company expects to recognize approximately in additional compensation expense related to unvested stock awards during the remainder of 2024 and to recognize approximately , , and in additional compensation expense related to unvested stock awards during the years 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. 
 
 The total grant date fair value of stock vested during the first nine months of 2023 was approximately . The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense, recognized in salaries, wages and benefits during the first nine months of 2023, was approximately and includes approximately recognized as a result of the grant of shares to certain non-employee directors. The recognition of stock-based compensation expense decreased both diluted and basic earnings per common share by approximately during the first nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had stock-based compensation plans with total unvested stock-based compensation expense of approximately , which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. 
 
 A summary of the status of the Company s non-vested restricted stock as of September 30, 2024, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is as follows:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately under this program. As of September 30, 2024, there remain shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under this plan. 
 
 On April 24, 2024, the Company commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to shares of the Company s outstanding common stock at a price of not greater than nor less than per share. Following the expiration of the tender offer on May 22, 2024, the Company accepted shares of its common stock for purchase at per share, at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million, excluding fees and expenses related to the offer. The Company funded the purchase of the accepted shares tendered with available cash and accounted for the repurchase of these shares as treasury stock on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method. As of September 30, 2024, shares were held in the treasury at an aggregate cost of approximately .

and forward remain open to examination in those jurisdictions. 
 
 In determining whether a tax asset valuation allowance is necessary, management, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 - 10 - 30, Accounting for Income Taxes , weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is necessary. If negative conditions exist which indicate a valuation allowance might be necessary, consideration is then given to what effect the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the availability of tax strategies might have on future taxable income to determine the amount, if any, of the required valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2024, management determined that the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax strategies would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its tax assets and therefore a valuation allowance was not necessary. 
 
 The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of September 30, 2024, an adjustment to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for uncertain tax positions has not been required as management believes that the Company s tax positions taken in income tax returns filed or to be filed are supported by clear and unambiguous income tax laws. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions, if any, in income tax expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not recognized or accrued any interest or penalties related to uncertain income tax positions. 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rates were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory rates to pre-tax income primarily due to state income taxes.

The Company s investments in marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices. The carrying value of other financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 
 
 The carrying amount for the line of credit approximates fair value because the line of credit interest rate is adjusted frequently. 

For long-term debt other than the lines of credit, the fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and estimated fair value of this other long-term debt at September 30, 2024 was as follows: 

The Company has not elected the fair value option for any of its financial instruments.

million. Therefore, we specifically reserve for claims that are expected to exceed million when fully developed, based on the facts and circumstances of those claims. 
 
 If we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve, it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company leases trucks to owner-operators under operating leases, which generally have a term of up to five years and include options to purchase the truck at the end of the lease. In the event that an independent contractor defaults on their lease, the Company generally leases the truck to another independent contractor. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the gross carrying value of trucks underlying these leases was million and accumulated depreciation was million. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the equipment, down to an estimated salvage value. In most cases, the Company has agreements in place with certain manufacturers whereby salvage values are guaranteed by the manufacturer. In other cases, where salvage values are not guaranteed, estimates of salvage value are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million of depreciation expense for these assets. 
 
 The Company leases dock space to a related party at our Laredo, Texas terminal. The dock space is depreciated in conjunction with the structures and improvements for the entire Laredo terminal on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Lease income is recorded as a component of non-operating income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Unless the context otherwise requires, this report presents information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Company s administrative headquarters are in Tontitown, Arkansas. From this location we manage operations conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries based in various locations around the United States and in Mexico and Canada. The operations of these subsidiaries can generally be classified into either truckload services or brokerage and logistics services. This designation is based primarily on the ownership of the asset that performed the freight transportation service. Truckload services are performed by Company divisions that generally utilize Company-owned trucks, long-term contractors, or single-trip contractors to transport loads of freight for customers, while brokerage and logistics services coordinate or facilitate the transport of loads of freight for customers and generally involve the utilization of single-trip contractors. Both our truckload operations and our brokerage and logistics operations have similar economic characteristics and are impacted by virtually the same economic factors as discussed elsewhere in this report. 
 
 For both operations, substantially all of our revenue is generated by transporting freight for customers and is predominantly affected by the rates per mile received from our customers, equipment utilization, and our percentage of non-compensated miles. These aspects of our business are carefully managed, and efforts are continuously underway to achieve favorable results. Truckload services revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, represented 68.8 and 64.4 of total revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The remaining revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, were generated from brokerage and logistics services. 
 
 The main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are costs incurred in transporting freight for our customers. Currently, our most challenging costs include fuel, driver recruitment, training, wage and benefits costs, independent broker costs (which we record as purchased transportation), insurance, maintenance and capital equipment costs. 
 
 In discussing our results of operations, we use revenue before fuel surcharge (and fuel expense, net of fuel surcharge), because management believes that eliminating the impact of this often-volatile source of revenue allows a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 21.8 million and 27.2 million, respectively, of the Company s total revenue was generated from fuel surcharges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 66.1 million and 80.8 million, respectively, of the Company s total revenue was generated from fuel surcharges. We may also discuss certain changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue, before fuel surcharge, rather than absolute dollar changes. We do this because we believe the variable cost nature of certain expenses makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, truckload services revenue, before fuel surcharges, decreased 1.5 to 110.6 million as compared to 112.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease relates primarily to a 1.5 decrease in total miles travelled from 47.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 46.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and to a 2.0 decrease in our rate per mile, from 2.14 for the third quarter of 2023 to 2.10 for the third quarter of 2024. The reduction in total miles was primarily driven by a 1.6 reduction in average miles driven by each truck combined with a 1.4 reduction in the average number of trucks operated during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Operating supplies and expenses decreased from 13.3 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 11.7 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. The decrease relates primarily to a reduction in repair and tire expenses, which is a result of introducing new, more reliable revenue equipment to our fleet, while retiring older, less-reliable revenue equipment. The decrease can also be partially attributed to a decrease in truck count from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Rent and purchased transportation increased from 22.6 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 26.7 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the proportion of miles driven by third-party carriers quarter over quarter, as the average number of third-party trucks increased from 326 during the third quarter of 2023 to 481 during the third quarter of 2024, while the average number of company trucks decreased from 2,007 to 1,820 during that same period. 
 
 Depreciation increased from 13.6 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 15.8 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. The increase relates primarily to an increase in cost for replacement revenue equipment compared to the cost of retired equipment and to the interaction of a decrease in operating revenues with the fixed-cost nature of depreciation expense. 
 
 Non-operating income improved from 1.0 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 3.3 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in the market value of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense increased from 1.4 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 2.5 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. This increase is attributed to an increase in equipment note debt and to an increase in average borrowing rates from 3.66 during the third quarter of 2023 to 4.73 during the third quarter of 2024. 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, truckload services revenue, before fuel surcharges, decreased 10.7 to 319.4 million as compared to 357.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease relates primarily to an 8.0 decrease in total miles travelled from 148.3 million during the first nine months of 2023 to 136.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 and to a 3.4 decrease in our rate per mile, from 2.17 for the first nine months of 2023 to 2.10 for the first nine months of 2024. The reduction in total miles was primarily driven by a 4.2 reduction in the average number of trucks operated combined with a 4.5 reduction in average miles driven by each truck during the first nine month of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The reduction in truck count and miles resulted from a less favorable freight market year over year, characterized by an oversupply of available trucks in the market compared to available freight. 
 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased from 37.2 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, in the first nine months of 2023 to 39.0 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. This year to year percentage-based increase is explained by the interaction of salaries and wages with fixed-cost characteristics combined with the year to year reduction in revenue recognized during the first nine months of the year. 
 
 Rent and purchased transportation increased from 23.0 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 25.3 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the proportion of miles driven by third-party carriers year over year. The average number of third-party trucks utilized increased from 360 during the first nine months of 2023 to 455 during the first nine months of 2024, while the average number of company trucks decreased from 2,038 to 1,842 during that same period. 
 
 Depreciation increased from 13.1 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 17.1 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. The increase relates primarily to an increase in cost for replacement revenue equipment compared to the cost of retired equipment and to the interaction of a decrease in operating revenues with the fixed-cost nature of depreciation expense. 
 
 Insurance and claims expense decreased from 7.0 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 4.7 of revenues before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. This decrease relates primarily to specific auto liability claims being settled in the latter half of 2023. This decrease was partially offset by a 12.8 increase in auto liability premiums year over year. 
 
 Non-operating income increased from 0.8 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 2.3 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in the market value of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense increased from 1.5 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 2.6 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. This increase is attributed to an increase in equipment note debt and to an increase in average borrowing rates from 3.66 as of September 30, 2023 to 4.73 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The truckload services division operating ratio, which measures the ratio of operating expenses, net of fuel surcharges, to operating revenues, before fuel surcharges, increased from 96.0 for the first nine months of 2023 to 102.8 for the first nine months of 2024.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, logistics and brokerage services revenue, before fuel surcharges, decreased 19.2 to 50.2 million as compared to 62.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease relates to a reduction in the average rates charged to customers year to year, as the truckload market continues to be negatively impacted by downward rate pressure driven by the challenging truckload rate environment. 
 
 Rents and purchased transportation increased from 85.7 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2023 to 86.8 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the third quarter of 2024. The increase resulted from paying third-party carriers a larger percentage of customer revenue. 
 
 The logistics and brokerage services division operating ratio, which measures the ratio of operating expenses, net of fuel surcharges, to operating revenues, before fuel surcharges, increased from 93.3 for the third quarter of 2023 to 94.3 for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, logistics and brokerage services revenue, before fuel surcharges, decreased 15.4 to 162.6 million as compared to 192.2 million during the first nine months of 2023. The decrease relates to a reduction in the average rates charged to customers year to year, as the truckload market continues to be negatively impacted by downward rate pressure driven by the challenging truckload rate environment. 
 
 Rents and purchased transportation increased from 84.1 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2023 to 86.4 of revenues, before fuel surcharges, during the first nine months of 2024. The increase resulted from paying third-party carriers a larger percentage of customer revenue. 
 
 The logistics and brokerage services division operating ratio, which measures the ratio of operating expenses, net of fuel surcharges, to operating revenues, before fuel surcharges, increased from 91.2 for the first nine months of 2023 to 94.0 for the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMBINED SERVICES 
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 Net income for all divisions was approximately 2.4 million, or 1.5 of revenues, before fuel surcharges for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net income of 6.1 million, or 3.5 of revenues, before fuel surcharges for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income resulted in diluted earnings per share of 0.11 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to diluted earnings per share of 0.28 for the third quarter of 2023.

Table of Contents 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, all divisions recognized a combined net loss of approximately 0.2 million, or 0.1 in excess of revenues, before fuel surcharges as compared to net income of 20.6 million, or 3.8 of revenues, before fuel surcharges for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in net income resulted in a diluted loss per share of (0.01) for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to diluted earnings per share of 0.93 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our business has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment in new revenue equipment. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations, proceeds from the sales of revenue equipment, and borrowings under our credit facilities, installment notes, and investment margin account. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we generated 43.8 million in cash from operating activities. Investing activities used 54.9 million in cash in the first nine months of 2024. Financing activities used 41.4 million in cash in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Our primary use of funds is for the purchase of revenue equipment. We typically use installment notes with fixed interest rates and terms ranging from 36 to 84 months, our existing line of credit on an interim basis, proceeds from the sale or trade of equipment, and cash flows from operations to finance capital expenditures and repay long-term debt. During the first nine months of 2024, we utilized cash on hand, installment notes, and our line of credit to finance purchases of revenue equipment and other assets of approximately 124.4 million. 
 
 During the remainder of 2024, we expect to purchase approximately 232 trucks and 400 trailers while continuing to sell or trade older equipment, which we expect to result in net capital expenditures of approximately 18.9 million. 
 
 On April 24, 2024, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to 550,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock at a price of not greater than 18.00 nor less than 15.50 per share. Following the expiration of the tender offer on May 22, 2024, we accepted 284,206 shares of our common stock for purchase at 18.00 per share, at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5.1 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the offer. The Company funded the purchase of the accepted shares tendered with available cash. 
 
 We currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance our growth and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we maintained a revolving line of credit. Amounts outstanding under the line bear interest at Term SOFR plus 1.85 (7.18 at September 30, 2024), are secured by our trade accounts receivable and mature on July 1, 2027. An unused fee of 0.25 is charged if average borrowings are less than 18.0 million. At September 30, 2024 we had no outstanding borrowings against the line of credit and approximately 0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, with availability to borrow 59.9 million. 
 
 Trade accounts receivable increased from 80.6 million at December 31, 2023 to 93.7 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was a result of an increase in revenues, which flow through accounts receivable, during the final month of the quarter ending September 30, 2024 compared to the final month of the year ending December 31, 2023. Additionally, the company s cash suspense decreased during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Prepaid expenses and deposits decreased from 13.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 9.5 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease relates to the normal amortization of items prepaid as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Revenue equipment increased from 689.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 726.2 million at September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to the purchase of new trucks and trailers during the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by the disposition of aging trucks and trailers during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Land increased from 23.1 million at December 31, 2023 to 30.4 million at September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to the purchase of land in El Paso, Texas that will serve as an additional terminal for our truckload operations. 
 
 Accounts payable decreased from 62.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 37.9 million at September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to payments made in the first nine months of 2024 on contracts for revenue equipment placed in service, but not yet paid for at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our accounts payable includes outstanding invoices for revenue equipment totaling 0.9 million.

Long-term debt and current maturities of long term-debt are reviewed on an aggregate basis, as the classification of amounts in each category are typically affected merely by the passage of time. Long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, on an aggregate basis, increased from 261.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 288.7 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily related to the financing of additional revenue equipment during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 See Note B to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of the most recent accounting pronouncements and their impact, if any, on the Company. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 Our primary market risk exposures include equity price risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk (the price paid to obtain diesel fuel for our trucks), and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The potential adverse impacts of these risks are discussed below. While the Company has used derivative financial instruments in the past to manage its interest rate and commodity price risks, the Company does not currently enter into such instruments for risk management purposes or for speculation or trading. 
 
 The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that an adverse change in the overall economy may have, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results of changes in prices or rates may differ materially from the hypothetical results described below. 
 
 Equity Price Risk 
 We hold certain actively traded marketable equity securities, which subjects the Company to fluctuations in the fair market value of its investment portfolio based on the current market price of such securities. The recorded value of marketable equity securities increased to 44.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 43.2 million at December 31, 2023. A 10 decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities would cause a corresponding 10 decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or approximately 4.4 million. For additional information with respect to marketable equity securities, see Note D to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our line of credit bears interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus a fixed percentage. Accordingly, changes in SOFR, which are affected by changes in interest rates, or a change to a new index rate, will affect the interest rate on, and therefore our costs under, the line of credit. Assuming 18.0 million of variable rate debt was outstanding under our line of credit for a full fiscal year, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in SOFR would result in approximately 180,000 of additional interest expense. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are generally outside of our control. Accordingly, the price and availability of diesel fuel, as well as other petroleum products, can be unpredictable. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Based upon our 2023 fuel consumption, a 10 increase in the average annual price per gallon of diesel fuel would increase our annual fuel expenses by 8.2 million. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the activities of our branch office located in Mexico. Currently, we do not hedge our exchange rate exposure through any currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency swaps as all of our revenues, and substantially all of our expenses and capital expenditures, are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases related to our Mexico branch office are incurred in or exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. Based on 2023 expenditures denominated in pesos, a 10 increase in the exchange rate would increase our annual operating expenses by 0.9 million.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Based on management s evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the ordinary conduct of business. We also provide accruals for claims within our self-insured retention amounts. We are currently self-insured for certain layers of auto liability claims in excess of 2.0 million. Therefore, we specifically reserve for claims that are expected to exceed 2.0 million when fully developed, based on the facts and circumstances of those claims. Based on our knowledge of the facts, and in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of such claims and pending litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, if we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve, it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Repurchases of Equity Securities 
 The Company s stock repurchase program has been extended and expanded several times, most recently in July 2023, when the Board of Directors reauthorized 500,000 shares of common stock for repurchase under the initial September 2011 authorization. Since the reauthorization, the Company has repurchased 25,984 shares of its common stock under this repurchase program. 
 
 No shares were repurchased under the Company s stock repurchase program during the third quarter of 2024. 

Item 5. Other Information. 
 
 Rule 10b5 - 1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 (a) of Regulation S-K.
