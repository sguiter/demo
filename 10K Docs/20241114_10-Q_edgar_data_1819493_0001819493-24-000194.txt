 Risks and Uncertainties 
 In recent years, the United States and other significant markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. Global general economic and political conditions, such as recession, inflation, uncertain credit and global financial markets, including potential future bank failures, health crises, supply chain disruption, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, changes to trade policies and tariffs, and geopolitical events such as local and national elections, corruption, political instability and acts of war or military conflict, or terrorism, make it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause our customers to slow spending on our products and services or impact their ability to make timely payments. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. In addition, there is a risk that our current or future suppliers, service providers, manufacturers or other partners may not survive such difficult economic times, which would directly affect our

 million . Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 reflects the consummation of the Arrangement with ElectraMeccanica on March 26, 2024. The Company s short- and long-term uses of cash are for working capital and to pay interest and principal on its debt. The Company has incurred losses since inception and had negative cash flow from operating activities of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As an early-stage growth company, the Company's ability to access capital is critical. However, there can be no assurance such capital will be available to the Company when needed, on favorable terms or at all. The consolidated financial information does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The Company intends to employ various strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations, which may include capital raising strategies such as debt financing, other non-dilutive financing and/or equity financing, including through asset-based lending and/or receivable financing and collecting on its outstanding receivables. The Company also has in place the ability to access capital through the SEPA (defined below in Note 9 - Equity ), however , the ability to access the SEPA is dependent on trading volumes and the market price of Xos Common Stock. Furthermore, the Company s access to capital under the SEPA is limited to the extent of the shares registered for resale pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment Number 1 thereto, which was declared effective on September 10, 2024, and the satisfaction of other applicable conditions. 
 On August 9, 2022 (as amended on September 28, 2022), the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement with Aljomaih Automotive Co. Aljomaih under which the Company agreed to sell and issue to Aljomaih a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of million and a maturity date of August 11, 2025.

 to years. The Company accrues warranty reserve for the products sold, which includes its best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Company s relatively short history of sales, and changes to its historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. Claims incurred under the Company s standard product warranty programs are recorded based on open claims. The Company recorded warranty liability within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 On June 22, 2023, the Company and Yorkville entered into the First Amendment to Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA Amendment ), in which the Company and Yorkville amended the SEPA to: (1) change the calculation of the purchase price of an Option 1 Advance (as defined in the SEPA) from an average of the daily VWAP of the Common Stock during a pricing period to the lowest VWAP during such pricing period; (2) change the denomination of any requested advances from the Company to Yorkville under the SEPA from dollars to shares; (3) increase Yorkville s beneficial ownership limitation under the SEPA from to of the outstanding Common Stock, provided that if any portion of an advance under the SEPA would cause Yorkville to exceed the beneficial ownership limitation due to Yorkville s ownership of the Company s securities convertible into Common Stock, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that such securities will be convertible into will be reduced by the number of shares of Common Stock included in such advance for such period that Yorkville holds such shares of common stock covered by such advance and the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such advance will not be reduced; (4) extend the commitment period to February 11, 2026 and (5) make other administrative and drafting changes. 
 Pursuant to the Side Letter, the Company and Yorkville agreed, among other things, to remove the restriction in the Securities Purchase Agreement on the Company s ability to effect an advance under the SEPA, subject to certain conditions while the Convertible Debentures remain outstanding. The proceeds from any advance under the SEPA would offset an equal amount outstanding under the Convertible Debentures as an optional redemption.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information which Xos management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in this Item 2 (including in the sections entitled Overview and Liquidity and Capital Resources below), in the accompanying unaudited notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report, under the section entitled Risk Factors of this Report, and under the heading Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to we , us , our , and the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of Xos and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a leading fleet electrification solutions provider committed to the decarbonization of commercial transportation. We design and manufacture Class 5-8 battery-electric commercial vehicles that travel on last-mile, back-to-base routes of up to 200 miles per day. We also offer charging infrastructure products and services through Xos Energy Solutions to support electric vehicle fleets. Our proprietary fleet management software, Xosphere , integrates vehicle operation and vehicle charging to provide commercial fleet operators a more seamless and cost-efficient vehicle ownership experience than traditional internal combustion engine counterparts. We developed the X-Platform (our proprietary, purpose-built vehicle chassis platform) and the X-Pack (our proprietary battery system) specifically for the medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment with a focus on last-mile commercial fleet operations. 
 Our X-Platform and X-Pack provide modular features that allow us to accommodate a wide range of last-mile applications and enable us to offer clients at a lower total cost of ownership compared to traditional diesel fleets. The X-Platform and X-Pack were both engineered to be modular in nature to allow fleet operators to customize their vehicles to fit their commercial applications (e.g., upfitting with a specific vehicle body and/or tailoring battery range). 
 Through our Powered by Xos business we also provide mix-use powertrain solutions for off-highway, industrial and other specialty vehicles, such as forklifts, school buses, medical and dental clinics, blood donation vehicles, and mobile command vehicles. Our powertrain offerings encompass a broad range of solutions, including high-voltage batteries, power distribution and management componentry, battery management systems, system controls, inverters, electric traction motors and auxiliary drive systems. 
 Xos Energy Solutions is our comprehensive charging infrastructure through which we offer mobile and permanent multi-application charging equipment, mobile energy storage, and turnkey energy infrastructure services to accelerate transitions to electric fleets by maximizing incentive capture and reducing implementation lead times and costs. Xos Energy Solutions offers customers full service project management, electric vehicle chargers and charging equipment, and solutions for charging infrastructure installation. This service is available to customers whether they use Xos trucks, competitor trucks, or a mixed fleet. 
 We have also developed a fleet management platform called Xosphere that interconnects vehicle, maintenance, charging, and service data. The Xosphere is aimed at minimizing electric fleet total cost of ownership through fleet management integration. This comprehensive suite of tools allows fleet operators to monitor vehicle and charging performance in real-time with in-depth telematics; reduce charging cost; optimize energy usage; and manage maintenance and support with a single software tool. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered 78 vehicles and 16 powertrains (including leases and hubs). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered 104 vehicles and 1 powertrain. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 14.9 million in revenue (or 95 of revenue) from vehicle, powertrain and hub sales, 0.1 million (or 1 of revenue) in other product revenue, and 0.7 million (or 5 of revenue) in ancillary revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 16.0 million in revenue (or 96 of revenue) from vehicle and powertrain sales, 0.1 million (or 1 of revenue) in other product revenue, and 0.6 million (or 3 of revenue) from ancillary revenue. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered 216 vehicles and 30 powertrains (including leases and hubs). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered 171 vehicles (including leases) and 3 powertrains. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 41.5 million in revenue (or 93 of revenue) from vehicle, powertrain and hub sales, 1.4 million (or 3 of revenue) in other product revenue, and 1.6 million (or 4 of revenue) in ancillary revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 24.8 million in revenue (or 95 of revenue) from vehicle and powertrain sales, 0.4 million (or 2 of revenue) in other product revenue, and 1.0 million (or 3 of revenue) from ancillary revenue. 
 We believe our growth in the coming years will be supported by the growth of e-commerce and last-mile delivery, and will depend in part on regulatory and consumer interest in reducing the impacts of climate change. E-commerce continues to grow rapidly and has been accelerated by changes in consumer purchasing behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial trucks are the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses per capita in the transportation industry. Although there can be no assurance such goals will be maintained, the U.S. federal, state and foreign governments, along with corporations such as FedEx, UPS and Amazon, have set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We believe regulation relating to commercial vehicles, sustainability initiatives from leading financial and corporate institutions and growth of last-mile logistics will be important factors in establishing the level of demand for, and adoption of, our products worldwide. 
 Xos is an early-stage growth company, and as such incurred net losses and cash outflows since its inception. As an early-stage growth company, the Company's ability to access capital is critical. However, there can be no assurance such capital will be available to the Company when needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable, obtain a sufficient level of new capital in the near-term and/or obtain replacement financing for or extend the maturity of existing debt, we could be required to dissolve and liquidate our assets under bankruptcy laws or otherwise. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 On January 11, 2024, Xos and ElectraMeccanica entered into an arrangement agreement, as amended on January 31, 2024 (the Arrangement Agreement ), pursuant to which Xos acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of ElectraMeccanica ElectraMeccanica Shares pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the Arrangement ). 
 
 The Arrangement was consummated on March 26, 2024. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, on March 26, 2024, each ElectraMeccanica Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement was converted automatically into the right to receive 0.0143739 of a share of our Common Stock, for total consideration of 1,766,388 shares of Common Stock. Our liquidity was supplemented by net cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of ElectraMeccanica, which was approximately 50.2 million. 
 
 Management s plans to improve Xos s liquidity and working capital requirements over the next twelve months include reducing operating costs in order to conserve financial resources. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Xos took the following measures: 
 
 We completed a reduction in force (the RIF pursuant to which we terminated approximately 26 of our total workforce. We do not expect to incur material costs in connection with the RIF. The RIF may have unintended adverse effects on our operations and results. See Our recent cost-cutting measures may not adequately reduce our operating costs or improve our operating margins, may lead to additional workforce attrition and may cause operational disruptions in Part II Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report. 
 
 Certain of our senior executives have accepted temporary reductions in their annual base salaries, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer who have volunteered to temporarily reduce their cash salaries by between approximately 20 and approximately 50 , effective October 28, 2024. See Part II, Item 5 Other Information of this Report for more information. 

Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed in this Report. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Successful Commercialization of our Products and Services 
 We expect to derive future revenue from sales of our vehicles, battery systems and other product and service offerings. As many of these products are in development, we will require substantial additional capital to continue developing our products and services and bring them to full commercialization as well as fund our operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales, we expect to finance a substantial portion of our operations through commercialization and production with proceeds from the Business Combination, the SEPA, the Convertible Note (as defined below), the ElectraMeccanica acquisition and any future capital raising efforts . The amount and timing of our future funding requirements, if any, will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our commercialization efforts. 
 Customer Demand 
 We have sold a limited number of our vehicles to our existing customers, have agreements with future customers and have received interest from other potential customers. The sales of our vehicles and services to our existing and future customers will be an important indicator of our performance. 
 Supply Chain Disruptions 
 While our ability to source certain critical inventory items has been steadily improving since prior years, it is still experiencing long-standing negative effects from global economic conditions, and expects such effects to continue to varying degrees for the foreseeable future. We have also observed, and expect to be impacted by, sporadic and unpredictable shortages for specific components, primarily in power electronics and harnesses, and disruptions to the supply of components. Fluctuating fuel prices and geopolitical conflicts have compounded ongoing supply and demand pressures for shipping, resulting in port congestion, higher freight fees and longer transit times. 
 
 Despite these disruptions, our supply chain team continues to employ mitigating strategies to effectively source inventory for all of our products. We continue working with vendors to find alternative solutions to overcome these constraints and, where appropriate, working to find alternate sources of supply for critical components, including placing orders in advance of projected need, while ensuring such components have extended usage projected. We also have been closely monitoring potential changes to trade policies and tariffs in order to proactively adjust and refine our strategy. These steps are designed to promote availability of materials in time to meet production plans, without inflating inventory beyond projected lead times. 

Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xos and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Xos Fleet, Inc. and Xos Services, Inc. (f/k/a Rivordak, Inc.), as well as the entities acquired pursuant to the Arrangement with ElectraMeccanica. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All long-lived assets are maintained in, and all losses are attributable to, the United States. 
 Currently, we conduct business through one operating segment. We are an early-stage growth company with minimal commercial operations and our activities to date have been conducted primarily within North America. For more information about our basis of operations, refer to Note 1 - Description of Business in the accompanying unaudited notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 To date, we have primarily generated revenue from the sale of electric step vans, stripped chassis vehicles and battery systems. Our stripped chassis is our vehicle offering that consists of our X-Platform electric vehicle base and X-Pack battery systems, which customers can upfit with their preferred vehicle body. As we continue to expand our commercialization, we expect our revenue to come from these products and other vehicle offerings including chassis cabs, which will feature our chassis and powertrain with the inclusion of a proprietary designed cab, and tractors, a shortened version of the chassis cab designed to haul trailers (also known as day cabs ), that travel in last-mile use cases. In addition, we also offer service offerings that include Xos Energy Solutions , our energy solutions offering and Xosphere , our fleet management platform. 
 Revenue consists of product sales, inclusive of shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for customer allowances, service offerings, and leasing. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 products. All revenue is recognized when we satisfy the performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by delivering the promised products to the customer, with the revenue recognized at the point in time the customer takes control of the products. For shipping and handling charges, revenue is recognized at the time the products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. For leasing, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. The majority of our current contracts have a single performance obligation, which is met at the point in time that the product is delivered, and title passes, to the customer, and are short term in nature. 
 Revenue also consists of sales-type leases which are accounted for under ASC 842. Revenue is the lower of the fair value of the asset leased or the present value of the lease receivable and prepayments. 
 We also earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to emission reduction, clean fuel, and others. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credit is transferred to the purchasing party. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold includes materials and other direct costs related to production of our vehicles, including components and parts, batteries, direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead, among others. Cost of goods sold also includes material and other direct costs related to the production and assembly of powertrains and battery packs as well as materials and other costs incurred related to charging infrastructure installation. Materials include inventory purchased from suppliers, as well as assembly components that are assembled by company personnel, including allocation of stock-based compensation expense. Direct labor costs relate to the wages of those individuals responsible for the assembly of vehicles, powertrain units and batteries delivered to customers. Cost of goods sold also includes depreciation expense on property and equipment related to cost of goods sold activities, calculated over the estimated useful life of the property and equipment on a straight-line basis. Upon property and equipment retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset disposed, and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, allocated to cost of goods sold. 
 Cost of goods sold includes reserves for estimated warranty expenses as well as reserves for estimated returns of vehicles. Additionally, cost of goods sold includes adjustments for the results of physical inventory counts. Cost of goods sold also includes reserves to write down the carrying value of our inventory to their net realizable value and to provide for any excess or obsolescence. 
 We are continuing to undertake efforts to find more cost-effective vendors and sources of parts and raw materials to lower our overall cost of production. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative G A expense consists of personnel-related expenses, outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services, as well as expenses for facilities, non-sales related travel, and general office supplies and expenses. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, allocations of stock-based compensation, and associated payroll taxes. Overhead items including rent, insurance, utilities, and other items are included in G A expense. G A expense also includes depreciation expense on property and equipment related to G A activities, calculated over the estimated useful life of the property and equipment on a straight-line basis. Upon property and equipment retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset disposed, and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, allocated to G A. 
 We expect that our G A expense will decrease for the foreseeable future primarily due to lower headcount driven by our reduction in workforce. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development R D expense consists primarily of costs incurred for the design and development of our vehicles and battery systems, which include: 
 expenses related to materials and, supplies consumed in the development and modifications to existing vehicle designs, new vehicle designs contemplated for additional customer offerings, and our battery pack design; 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 fees paid to third-parties such as consultants and contractors for engineering and computer-aided design work on vehicle designs and other third-party services; and 
 payroll expense for employees primarily engaged in R D activities, including allocation of stock-based compensation expense. 
 We expect our R D costs to decrease for the foreseeable future primarily due to lower headcount driven by our reduction in workforce. 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 Sales and marketing S M expense consists primarily of e xpenses related to our marketing of vehicles and brand initiatives, which includes: 
 travel expenses of our sales force who are primarily responsible for introducing our platform and offerings to potential customers; 
 web design, marketing and promotional items, and consultants who assist in the marketing of the Company and its products and services; 
 payroll expense for employees primarily engaged in S M activities, including allocation of stock-based compensation expense; and 
 depreciation expense on property and equipment related to S M activities, calculated over the estimated useful life of the property and equipment on a straight-line basis. Upon property and equipment retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset disposed, and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, allocated to S M. 
 We expect our S M expense to decrease for the foreseeable future primarily due to lower headcount driven by our reduction in workforce. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net is comprised of income associated with the duty drawback receivable, which is estimated recovery of tariffs paid for vehicles that were acquired through the ElectraMeccanica acquisition, interest income from our investments in marketable debt securities, available-for-sale (applicable to 2023), income from the sublease of our Los Angeles office space, and other income, partially offset by interest paid on our equipment leases and interest expense related to our financing obligations, including the amortization for debt discount and issuance costs. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
 Change in fair value of derivative instruments relates to Common Stock warrant liability assumed as part of the Business Combination and the conversion feature on the convertible notes issued in prior years and derivative features of the Convertible Debentures issued on August 11, 2022 and September 21, 2022. Changes in the fair value relate to remeasurement of our public and private placement warrants to fair value as of any respective exercise date and as of each subsequent balance sheet date and mark-to-market adjustments for derivative liabilities each measurement period. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Earn-out Shares Liability 
 The contingent earn-out shares liability was established as part of the Business Combination. Changes in the fair value relate to remeasurement to fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date.

 Our total revenues decreased by 0.9 million, or 5 , from 16.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 15.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in unit sales and ancillary revenue, partially offset by an increase in average selling price, and the sale of automotive regulatory credits. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 78 stepvans and 16 powertrains (including hubs), compared to 104 stepvans and 1 powertrain during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our total revenues increased by 18.3 million, or 70 , from 26.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 44.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales and in average selling price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 216 stepvans, 30 powertrains (including hubs), compared to 171 stepvans (including leases) and 3 powertrains during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold decreased by 1.8 million, or 12 , from 14.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of goods sold is directly attributable to the decrease in our product revenue and associated decreases of (i) 2.6 million in direct materials and (ii) 0.3 million for dealer return reserves. These decreases were offset by increases of (i) 0.9 million related to inventory reserves and associated write-downs to net realizable value, (ii) 0.1 million for warranty reserve and (iii) 0.1 million more in unfavorable physical inventory count and other adjustments. In addition, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, and freight costs stayed the same quarter over quarter. 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 8.0 million, or 28 , from 28.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 36.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in cost of goods sold is directly attributable to the increase in our product revenue and associated increases of (i) 7.5 million in direct materials, (ii) 1.1 million in direct labor, manufacturing overhead, and freight, and (iii) 1.1 million for dealer return reserves. These increases were offset by a decrease of (i) 1.1 million related to reductions in inventory reserves and write-downs of inventories to their net realizable value recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (ii) 0.3 million for warranty reserve and (iii) 0.3 million less in unfavorable physical inventory count and other adjustments. 
 The changes in direct labor encompasses both employee and subcontractor labor costs. The changes in direct labor, manufacturing overhead and direct material costs are driven by changes in units sold. A significant portion of the overhead costs incurred include freight, indirect salaries, facility rent, utilities, and depreciation of production equipment, which are primarily fixed in nature and allocated based on production levels. Accordingly, these costs are still incurred when we experience a reduction in production volume. As we increase production activities, we are expecting fixed and semi-fixed overhead costs to be absorbed through the production of our batteries, hubs and chassis. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 0.4 million, or 4 , from 8.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, attributable to increases of (i) 0.7 million in facility expenses, primarily due to two operating leases acquired in connection with the ElectraMeccanica acquisition, , (ii) 0.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, (iii) 0.1 million in professional fees, and (iv) 0.1 million in headcount and personnel costs for legal, finance, accounting, information technology and general and administrative functions. These increases were offset by decreases of (i) 0.4 million in other operating expenses, including travel, recruiting, and equipment costs, (ii) 0.2 million in insurance costs, and (iii) 0.1 million in depreciation expense due to the allocation of overhead costs. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 2.9 million, or 10 , from 30.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 27.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, attributable to decreases of (i) 1.2 million in professional fees, (ii) 1.2 million in other operating expenses, including travel, recruiting, and equipment costs, (iii) 1.1 million in insurance costs driven by cost efficiencies associated with a new broker, and (iv) 0.9 million in headcount and personnel costs for legal, finance, accounting, information technology and general and administrative functions. These decreases were offset by increases of (i) 1.3 million in facility expenses, primarily due to two operating leases acquired in connection with the ElectraMeccanica acquisition, (ii) 0.1 million in depreciation expense due to the allocation of overhead costs, and (iii) 0.1 million in stock-based compensation expense.

 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 1.9 million, or 42 , from 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to decreases of (i) 1.1 million in allocation of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, driven by lower headcount in engineering, (ii) 0.5 million in equipment and material purchases due to fewer research and development projects in development year over year and (iii) 0.3 million in other research and development costs, including consulting and software. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 6.8 million, or 44 , from 15.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to decreases of (i) 3.5 million in allocation of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, driven by lower headcount in engineering, (ii) 2.2 million in equipment and material purchases due to fewer research and development projects in development year over year and (iii) 1.1 million in other research and development costs, including consulting and software. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased by 0.5 million, or 33 , from 1.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to decreases of (i) 0.3 million in allocation of personnel costs driven by lower headcount and (ii) 0.2 million in other sales and marketing expenses such as customer accommodation payments and sales events. 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased by 1.9 million, or 36 , from 5.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to decreases of (i) 1.3 million in allocation of personnel costs driven by lower headcount, (ii) 0.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and (iii) 0.4 million in other sales and marketing expenses such as customer accommodation payments and sales events. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net increased by 1.0 million, from a 1.7 million expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a 0.7 million expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change was attributable to decreases of (i) 0.8 million in net interest expense related to the Convertible Note and Conv ertible Debentures, including amortization of related discounts and issuance costs, primarily due to Convertible Debentures being fully repaid on December 4, 2023 and (ii) 0.4 million of redemption premiums related to prepayments on Convertible Debentures during the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no such comparable expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by 0.2 million of impairment losses due to the sale of assets previously designated as held-for-sale. 
 Other income (expense), net increased by 10.1 million, from an 9.8 million expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a 0.3 million income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was attributable to decreases of (i) 5.1 million in net interest expense related to the Convertible Note and Convertible Debentures, including amortization of related discounts and issuance costs, primarily due to Convertible Debentures being fully repaid on December 4, 2023, (ii) 1.3 million for impairment on assets held for sale, (iii) 1.2 million of redemption premiums related to prepayments on Convertible Debentures during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no such comparable expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (iv) 0.2 million in amortization expense related to marketable debt securities, available-for-sale with no such comparable expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 2.3 million increase in other income, net related to the estimated amount that can be recovered from previously paid tariffs relating to crushed SOLO vehicles that were acquired in connection with the ElectraMeccanica acquisition. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivatives 
 The loss on the change in fair value of derivative instruments increased by 0.4 million, or 134 , from a 0.3 million gain in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.1 million loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value in both periods is primarily attributable to the change in our stock price and the resulting valuation at the respective reporting period. 
 The loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments increased by 0.7 million, or 128 , from a gain of 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a loss of 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value in both periods is primarily attributable to the change in our stock price and the resulting valuation at the respective reporting period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents of 8.4 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 184.4 million. Our short-term uses of cash are for working capital , and our long-term uses of cash are for working capital and to pay the principal of our indebtedness. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately 31.2 million and had net cash used in operating activities of 52.1 million. 
 Under ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), we have the responsibilit y to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our future financial obligations as they become due within one year of the financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. The result of our ASC 205-40 analysis, due to uncertainties discussed below, is that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. 
 As an early-stage growth company, we have incurred net losses and cash outflows since our inception. We will continue to incur net losses and cash outflows in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to scale our operations to meet anticipated demand and seek to establish our product and service offerings. As a result, our ability to access capital is critical and until we can generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fund and scale our operations. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial information does not include any adjustment that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 In response to these conditions, we are currently evaluating different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. We have plans to secure and intend to employ various strategies to raise additional capital, which may include capital raising strategies such as debt financing (which may include asset-based lending and/or receivable financing), other non-dilutive financing, and/or equity financing. We also have in place the ability to access capital through the SEPA; h owever, our ability to access the SEPA is dependent on trading volumes and the market price of Xos Common Stock. Furthermore, our access to capital under the SEPA is limited to the extent of the 3,333,333 shares registered for resale pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment Number 1 thereto which was declared effective on September 10, 2024 and the satisfaction of other applicable conditions. Our ability to access other capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our development programs and other operations, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Global general economic and political conditions, such as inflation, uncertain credit and global financial markets, supply chain disruption, international currency fluctuations, and geopolitical events have had and could continue to have an adverse impact in our ability to raise additional funds. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our commercialization, research and development programs and/or other efforts and our ability to continue our operations would be negatively impacted. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements and/or seek protection under Chapters 7 or 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

 This could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete or partial loss of your investment in our Common Stock. 
 Standby Equity Purchase Agreement 
 On March 23, 2022, we entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with YA II PN, Ltd. Yorkville ), which was subsequently amended on June 22, 2023 (as amended, the "SEPA"), whereby we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville up to 125.0 million of our shares of Common Stock at our request any time until February 11, 2026, subject to certain conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining commitment available under the SEPA was 119.4 million. However, our ability to access the SEPA is dependent on trading volumes and the market price of our Common Stock and limited to the extent of the 3,333,333 shares registered for resale, among other things. We used the net proceeds received from sales of Common Stock pursuant to the SEPA for working capital and general corporate purposes and expect similar uses of any remaining proceeds going forward. See Note 8 Convertible Notes and Note 9 Equity Standby Equity Purchase Agreement in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the SEPA. 
 
 Convertible Debt 
 
 On August 11, 2022 and September 21, 2022, we issued convertible debentures (as subsequently amended, the Convertible Debentures to Yorkville in the aggregate principal amount of 35.0 million, with a maturity date of November 11, 2023, which was extended to February 11, 2024 pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Also on August 11, 2022, we issued a convertible promissory note (as subsequently amended and restated, the Convertible Note to Aljomaih Automotive Co. Aljomaih with a principal amount of 20.0 million and a maturity date of August 11, 2025. See Note 8 - Convertible Notes in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of 20.0 million was outstanding on the Convertible Note. The Convertible Debentures were fully repaid on December 4, 2023. We have used the net proceeds from the Convertible Debentures and the Convertible Note for operational liquidity, working capital and general and administrative expenses and expect similar uses of any remaining proceeds going forward.

 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cas h provided by investing activities was 51.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to 51.4 million net cash acquired in connection with the acquisition of ElectraMeccanica and net proceeds from sale of assets held for sale of 0.1 million partially offset by property and equipment purchases of 0.3 million. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 50.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the sale of investments in marketable debt securities of 50.7 million and net proceeds from sale of assets held for sale of 1.3 million, offset by property and equipment purchases of 1.2 million. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net c ash used in financi ng activities was 1.5 million f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily related to (i) equipment lease principal payments of 1.7 million and (ii) taxes paid relating to net-settlement of stock-based awards of 0.9 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from net short-term insurance financing note activity of 1.1 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to (i) payments for convertible notes (including prepayment premium) of 25.0 million, (ii) equipment lease principal payments of 2.5 million, (iii) taxes paid relating to net-settlement of stock-based award s of 0.9 million, and (iv) outflow from net short-term insurance financing note activity of 0.3 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under the SEPA of 1.2 million. 
 Cash Conservation Measures 
 
 Management s plans to improve our liquidity and working capital availability over the next twelve months include reducing operating costs in order to conserve financial resources. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we took the following measures: 
 
 We completed a reduction in force (the RIF pursuant to which we terminated approximately 26 of our total workforce. We do not expect to incur material costs in connection with the RIF. 
 
 Certain of our senior executives have accepted temporary reductions in their annual base salaries, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer who have volunteered to temporarily reduce their cash salaries by between approximately 20 and approximately 50 , effective October 28, 2024. See Part II, Item 5 Other Information of this Report for more information. 
 
 Management plans to continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs and, in particular, cash expenditures, in a manner intended to minimize their adverse impact on our core operations. However, there can be no assurance that the measures described above, or any other cost-cutting measures we may implement in the future, will be sufficient to address our immediate or longer-term liquidity and working capital needs. Moreover, it is possible that such measures will have an adverse effect on our operations (see Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report, under the caption Our recent cost-cutting measures may not adequately reduce our operating costs or improve our operating margins, may lead to additional workforce attrition and may cause operational disruptions ). 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We did not have any material contractual obligations or other commitments as of September 30, 2024, other than as disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K, except the remaining obligations for operating leases acquired in connection with ElectraMeccanica acquisition aggregating 24.1 million . 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements ha ve been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve inventory valuation, incremental borrowing rates for assessing operating and financing lease 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 liabilities, useful lives of property and equipment, earn-out shares liability, stock-based compensation, common stock warrant liability, product warranty liability and and valuations utilized in connection with acquisitions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial statements. 
 There were no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than below. 
 
 Duty Drawback Receivables: Duty drawback is the recovery of tariffs paid for vehicles that we acquired as a result of the consummation of the Arrangement. The Company expects to recover some of the vehicle inventory value through crushing the vehicles to recover tariffs already paid. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates aggregate tariff recovery of approximately 2.7 million upon destruction of SOLO vehicles and submission of the related claim documents. As of June 30, 2024, the Company completed the crushing of the vehicles but, as of September 30, 2024, has not yet received any tariff recovery related to the destruction of SOLO vehicles. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K), we are not required to provide the information under this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer carried out evaluations of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon each of their evaluations, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective at the reasonable assurance level for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, discover areas that need improvement in the future or discover additional material weaknesses, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected. 
 
 During the preparation of our Annual Report on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to the ineffective operation of controls related to inventory management and revenue recognition. As a result of these material weaknesses, management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 ensure that our financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024 , we have identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the ineffective operation of controls related to payroll that resulted in errors in recording payroll accruals, which caused liabilities and expenses to be understated for the three months ended March 31, 2024. As a result of this material weakness, management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements included in this Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In order to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the ineffective operation of controls related to payroll, management is implementing financial reporting control changes. Management is implementing remediation steps to improve its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, including further documenting and implementing control procedures to address the identified risks of material misstatements, and implementing monitoring activities over such control procedures. We believe we are on schedule to remediate the material weakness during the year ended December 31, 2024. Remediation efforts to date include the following: 
 
 Redesign internal controls over the payroll accrual process. 
 
 To further remediate the material weaknesses, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reaffirmed and reemphasized the importance of internal controls, control consciousness and a strong control environment. We also expect to continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated control operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that this enhanced control is operating effectively. 
 Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 In the 2023 Form 10-K, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the revenue recognition process. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we completed remediation efforts to address this material weakness, which included: 
 
 Adding additional internal controls over the revenue process 
 Partnering with external consultants specializing in public company control compliance, to assess and implement additional controls over the revenue process 
 
 Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, this material weakness has been remediated. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of ElectraMeccanica. Prior to the acquisition, ElectraMeccanica was a public reporting company listed on Nasdaq. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are continuing to incorporate our controls and procedures into ElectraMeccanica and to augment our company-wide controls to reflect the risks that may be inherent in acquisitions. 
 
 Other than our integration of the ElectraMeccanica business and the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our risk factors are described in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10-K . Except as stated below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. 
 
 As an early-stage growth company, our ability to access capital is critical. Unless and until we can generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fund and scale our operations. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts, needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our development programs and other operations. 
 
 Additional equity financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and, if available, could be dilutive to current stockholders. Our ability to access the SEPA is dependent on trading volumes and market price of our Common Stock. Furthermore, our ability to access the SEPA is limited to the extent of the 3,333,333 shares registered for resale pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended by Post-Effective Amendment Number 1 thereto which was declared effective on September 10, 2024, and the satisfaction of other applicable conditions. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. Moreover, 20.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes will need to be repaid out of our available cash on August 11, 2025, unless converted, extended or refinanced. 
 Global general economic and political conditions, such as a potential recession, inflation, uncertain credit and global financial markets, including potential future bank failures, health crises, supply chain disruption, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, changes to trade policies and tariffs, and geopolitical events such as local and national elections, corruption, political instability and tensions and acts of war or military conflict including repercussions of the wars between Russia and Ukraine and in Israel, terrorism, or tensions with China and related sanctions and export control restrictions, have and could continue to adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds, among other things. 
 Since inception, we financed our operations primarily from the sales of Common Stock, the Business Combination, the SEPA, the ElectraMeccanica acquisition and the issuance of debt. As of September 30, 2024 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents aggregating to 8.4 million (including cash acquired pursuant to the Arrangement with ElectraMeccanica, which closed on March 26, 2024). 
 If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future, any doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may make prospective investors or other financing sources more resistant or unwilling to provide funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements and/or seek protection under Chapters 7 or 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete or partial loss of your investment in our Common Stock. 
 If capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts, needed, we could be required to delay, scale back, or abandon some or all of our operations and development programs, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The result of our ASC 205-40 analysis, due to uncertainties discussed above, is that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Report. Our consolidated financial information does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Our recent cost-cutting measures may not adequately reduce our operating costs or improve our operating margins, may lead to additional workforce attrition and may cause operational disruptions. 
 
 In October 2024, we initiated a plan to reduce future operating expenses and improve cash flows through a reduction in force and a temporary reduction in cash salaries for certain senior executives. As part of this plan we made a reduction in our workforce of approximately 26 of our total employee base at the time of the announcement. 
 
 The charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with these cost-cutting measures, and timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and we may incur costs that are greater than we currently expect in connection with these activities. The cost-cutting measures may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, employee attrition beyond our intended reductions in force, and a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, these cost-cutting measures could place substantial demands on our management and remaining employees, which could lead to the diversion of attention from other business priorities. In addition, while we eliminated certain positions in connection with the reduction in force, certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees or to external service providers, which could result in disruptions to our operations. We may also discover that the workforce reductions will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. To compensate for reductions in salary for affected employees, we may incur additional unanticipated stock-based compensation expense and related dilution. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Temporary Modifications to Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Named Executive Officers 
 
 In connection with management s efforts to reduce operating costs in order to conserve financial resources, Xos s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer accepted temporary reductions in their annual base salaries of approximately 50 , and Xos s Chief Legal Officer accepted a temporary reduction in his annual base salary of approximately 20 , in each case effective as of October 28, 2024. The timing of any restoration of the base salaries will be based on evolving business and economic conditions and will be made in consultation with, and pursuant to the consent of, the Board of Directors. 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plan Adoptions and Modifications 
 
 Except as set forth in the following paragraph, during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
