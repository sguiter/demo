EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 of Rayonier Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and Rayonier, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Rayonier or the Company mean Rayonier Inc. and references to the Operating Partnership mean Rayonier, L.P. References to we, us, and our mean collectively Rayonier Inc., the Operating Partnership and entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Rayonier Inc. and/or the Operating Partnership. 
 
 Rayonier Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT UPREIT under which substantially all of its business is conducted through the Operating Partnership. Rayonier Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. On May 8, 2020, Rayonier, L.P. acquired Pope Resources, a Delaware Limited Partnership Pope Resources and issued approximately 4.45 million operating partnership units OP Units or Redeemable Operating Partnership Units of Rayonier, L.P. as partial merger consideration. These OP Units are generally considered to be economic equivalents to Rayonier common shares and receive distributions equal to the dividends paid on Rayonier common shares. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned a 98.7 interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 1.3 interest owned by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operatin g Partnership, Rayonier Inc. has exclusive control of the day-to-day management of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 Rayonier Inc. and the Operating Partnership are operated as one business. The management of the Operating Partnership consists of the same members as the management of Rayonier Inc. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, Rayonier Inc. consolidates Rayonier, L.P. for financial reporting purposes, and has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports of Rayonier Inc. and Rayonier, L.P. into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 
 Strengthens investors understanding of Rayonier Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a single operating unit in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 Creates efficiencies for investors by reducing duplicative disclosures and providing a single comprehensive document; and 
 Generates time and cost savings associated with the preparation of the reports when compared to preparing separate reports for each entity. 
 
 There are a few important differences between Rayonier Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how Rayonier Inc. operates as a consolidated company. The Company itself does not conduct business, other than through acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. The Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the Company s assets. Likewise, all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of the Company s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. 
 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report includes: 
 
 Separate Consolidated Financial Statements for Rayonier Inc. and Rayonier, L.P.; 
 A combined set of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements with separate discussions of per share and per unit information, noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity and partners capital, as applicable; 
 A combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which includes specific information related to each reporting entity;

We generally collect payment within a year of satisfying performance obligations and therefore have elected not to adjust revenues for a financing component. 
 CONTRACT BALANCES 
 The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing and cash collections results in trade receivables and deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trade receivables are recorded when we have an unconditional right to consideration for completed performance under the contract. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as (or when) we perform under the contract. 
 Trade receivables Contract liabilities Deferred revenue, current (b) Deferred revenue Deferred revenue, non-current (c) Long-term deferred revenue 
 
 (a) The increase in trade receivables was primarily driven by timing of sales in our timber segments. 
 (b) The increase in deferred revenue, current is driven by the timing of renewals of hunting contracts and the current portion of carbon capture and storage contracts entered into during 2024, partially offset by the satisfaction of post-closing obligations on real estate sales. 
 (c) The increase in deferred revenue, non-current is primarily driven by carbon capture and storage contracts entered into during 2024. 
 The following table summarizes revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue recognized from contract liability balance at the beginning of the year (a)

 controlling financial interest in Matariki Forestry Group (the New Zealand subsidiary ), a joint venture that owns or leases approximately legal acres of New Zealand timberland. Accordingly, we consolidate the New Zealand subsidiary s balance sheet and results of operations. Income attributable to the New Zealand subsidiary s noncontrolling interests is reflected as an adjustment to income in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) under the caption Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates. Rayonier New Zealand Limited RNZ ), a wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the manager of the New Zealand subsidiary. 
 NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP 
 Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the third-party ownership of Redeemable Operating Partnership Units. Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership is computed by applying the weighted average Redeemable Operating Partnership Units outstanding during the period as a percentage of the weighted average total units outstanding to the Operating Partnership s net income for the period. If a noncontrolling unitholder redeems a unit for a registered common share of Rayonier or cash, the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership will be reduced and the Company s share in the Operating Partnership will be increased by the fair value of each security at the time of redemption.

The New Zealand subsidiary s trading operations typically hedge a portion of export sales receipts to cover the projected foreign exchange exposure for the following three months. As of September 30, 2024, foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts had maturity dates through July 2027. 
 INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS 
 We are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt and on anticipated debt issuances. We use variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge this exposure. For these derivative instruments, we report the gains/losses from the fluctuations in the fair market value of the hedges in AOCI and reclassify them to earnings as interest expense in the same period in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. 
 To the extent we de-designate or terminate a cash flow hedging relationship and the associated hedged item continues to exist, any unrealized gain or loss of the cash flow hedge at the time of de-designation remains in AOCI and is amortized using the straight-line method through interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item. To the extent the associated hedged item is no longer effective, the gain or loss is reclassified out of AOCI to earnings immediately.

 It is expected that the upland mill site cleanup and NRD restoration will occur over the next one to , while the monitoring of Port Gamble Bay, mill site, and landfills will continue for an additional to years. NRD costs are subject to change as the restoration projects progress. It is reasonably possible that these components of the liability may increase as construction continues. Management continues to monitor the Port Gamble cleanup process and will make adjustments as needed. Should any future circumstances result in a change to the estimated cost of the project, we will record an appropriate adjustment to the liability in the period it becomes known and when we can reasonably estimate the amount. 
 
 We do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of the established liabilities. Our future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including, but not limited to, the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation, the evolving nature of environmental regulations, and the availability and application of technology. We do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity.

 qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering a portion of our employees and an unfunded plan that provides benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law in the qualified plans. We closed enrollment in the pension plans to salaried employees hired after December 31, 2005. Effective December 31, 2016, we froze benefits for all employees participating in the pension plan. In lieu of the pension plan, we provide those employees with an enhanced 401(k) plan match similar to what is currently provided to employees hired after December 31, 2005. Employee benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial estimates and management assumptions. These estimates are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause the estimates to change. 
 DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN 
 In December 2022, the Rayonier Board of Directors authorized the termination of its Defined Benefit Plan. Affected participants were notified of the termination and provided with alternative distribution options. The Defined Benefit Plan was terminated on February 28, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, lump sum distributions were made to participants who elected that option. The remaining plan liabilities were settled in March 2024 through the purchase of annuity contracts from a third-party insurance provider. In connection with the plan s termination, we made a cash contribution of million to fully fund the plan. Additionally, a pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge of million was recognized as a component of AOCI due to actuarial losses. 
 UNFUNDED PLAN 
 In July 2023, the Rayonier Board of Directors authorized the termination of the unfunded plan and distribution of all benefits in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The unfunded plan was terminated on July 31, 2023, and settled in the third quarter of 2024 with lump sum cash payments of million.

 OUR COMPANY 
 We are a leading timberland real estate investment trust REIT with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the United States and New Zealand. We invest in timberlands and actively manage them to provide current income and attractive long-term returns to our shareholders. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust UPREIT structure in which our assets are owned by our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Rayonier manages the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. Our revenues, operating income and cash flows are primarily derived from the following core business segments: Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber, Real Estate, and Trading. As of September 30, 2024, we owned or leased under long-term agreements approximately 2.7 million acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South (1.84 million acres), U.S. Pacific Northwest (417,000 acres) and New Zealand (411,000 gross acres or 289,000 net plantable acres). 
 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 The Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments include all activities related to the harvesting of timber and other value-added activities such as the licensing of properties for hunting, the leasing of properties for mineral extraction and cell towers, the sale of carbon credits, and revenue from land-based solutions such as carbon capture and storage, solar, and wind energy. Our New Zealand operations are conducted by Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture (the New Zealand subsidiary ), in which we maintain a 77 ownership interest. See Note 4 - Noncontrolling Interests for additional information regarding our noncontrolling interests in the New Zealand Timber segment. 
 The Real Estate segment includes all U.S. and New Zealand land or leasehold sales disaggregated into six sales categories: Improved Development, Unimproved Development, Rural, Timberland Non-Strategic, Conservation Easements and Large Dispositions. It also includes residential and commercial lease activity, primarily in the town of Port Gamble, Washington. 
 The Trading segment primarily reflects log trading activities in New Zealand and Australia conducted by our New Zealand subsidiary. It also includes log trading activities conducted from the U.S. South and Pacific Northwest. Our Trading segment activities include an export services joint venture with a third-party forest manager in which Matariki Forests Trading Ltd maintains a 50 ownership interest. The Trading segment complements the New Zealand Timber segment by providing added market intelligence, increasing the scale of export operations and achieving cost savings that directly benefit the New Zealand Timber segment. This additional market intelligence also benefits our Southern and Pacific Northwest export log marketing. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 For a full description of our environmental matters, see Item 1 - Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our sustainability report located at our Responsible Stewardship webpage. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends, current fact patterns, expectations and other sources of information we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a full description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS 
 The demand for timber is directly related to the underlying demand for pulp, paper, packaging, lumber and other wood products. The significant majority of timber sold in our Southern Timber segment is consumed domestically. With a higher proportion of pulpwood, our Southern Timber segment relies heavily on downstream markets for pulp and paper, and to a lesser extent wood pellet markets. Our Pacific Northwest Timber segment relies primarily on domestic customers but also exports timber to China and Japan. The Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber segments rely on the strength of U.S. lumber markets as well as underlying housing starts. Our New Zealand Timber segment sells timber to domestic New Zealand wood products mills and also exports a significant portion of its volume to Asian markets, particularly in China and South Korea. In addition to market dynamics in the Pacific Rim, the New Zealand Timber segment is subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which can impact the operating results of the segment in U.S. dollar terms. 
 Pricing in our timber segments is influenced by macroeconomic factors, including residential construction activity, and can also vary considerably on a local level based on weather, the available inventory of logs, mill demand, and export market access. In our Southern Timber segment, pine pulpwood net stumpage realizations have generally stabilized due to improved demand from pulp mills and weather-related constraints in select markets on competing supply, while pine sawtimber net stumpage realizations have been constrained by softer demand from lumber mills. In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, weighted-average delivered log prices remain under pressure due to soft domestic demand and reduced export market tension. In our New Zealand Timber segment, lower levels of construction activity in China continue to negatively impact export market demand and prices. 
 We are also subject to the risk of price fluctuations in certain of our cost components, primarily logging and transportation (cut and haul), ocean freight and demurrage costs. Other major components of our cost of sales are the cost basis of timber sold (depletion) and the cost basis of real estate sold. Depletion includes the amortization of capitalized site preparation, planting and fertilization, real estate taxes, timberland lease payments and certain payroll costs. The cost basis of real estate sold includes the cost basis in land and costs directly associated with the development and construction of identified real estate projects, such as infrastructure, roadways, utilities, amenities and/or other improvements. Other costs include amortization of capitalized costs related to road and bridge construction and software, depreciation of fixed assets and equipment, road maintenance, severance and excise taxes, fire prevention and real estate commissions and closing costs. 
 Our Real Estate segment is exposed to changes in interest and mortgage rates as higher rates could negatively impact buyer demand for the properties we sell. However, our improved development projects, specifically Wildlight, our development project north of Jacksonville, Florida, and Heartwood, our development project south of Savannah, Georgia, continue to benefit from favorable migration and demographic trends, which have thus far outweighed the impacts of higher interest rates.

 SOUTHERN TIMBER 
 Third quarter sales of 62.0 million decreased 2.0 million, or 3 , versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes decreased 13 to 1.57 million tons versus 1.81 million tons in the prior year period, primarily driven by wet ground conditions that constrained production as well as softer demand from lumber mills. Average pine sawtimber stumpage realizations decreased 5 to 27.46 per ton versus 28.85 per ton in the prior year period, primarily due to softer demand from sawmills and an unfavorable geographic mix. Average pine pulpwood stumpage realizations increased 4 to 17.21 per ton versus 16.54 per ton in the prior year period, primarily driven by improved demand from pulp mills and weather-related constraints on competing supply in certain markets. Overall, weighted-average net stumpage realizations (including hardwood) decreased 3 to 20.77 per ton versus 21.48 per ton in the prior year period. Non-timber sales of 16.7 million increased 6.8 million versus the prior year period, primarily driven by higher pipeline easement revenues and growth in our land-based solutions business.

 Third quarter sales of 66.8 million decreased 3.7 million, or 5 , versus the prior year period. Sales volumes decreased 1 to 686,000 tons versus 690,000 tons in the prior year period. Average delivered prices for export sawtimber increased 10 to 104.48 per ton versus 95.23 per ton in the prior year period, as higher shipping costs were partially passed on to export customers through increased prices. Average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber increased 2 to 64.89 per ton versus 63.45 per ton in the prior year period. Despite higher delivered log prices, net stumpage realizations declined 16 versus the prior year quarter, largely due to elevated shipping and production costs. Third quarter non-timber / carbon credit sales totaled 8.9 million versus 15.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a lower volume of carbon credits sold as compared to the prior year period. Operating income of 8.9 million decreased 8.6 million versus the prior year period due to lower carbon credit income 6.6 million), lower net stumpage realizations 2.6 million), higher costs 0.2 million), and lower volumes 0.1 million), partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts 0.5 million) and lower depletion rates 0.3 million ).

 Year-to-date sales of 166.3 million decreased 9.2 million, or 5 , versus the prior year period. Sales volumes decreased 5 to 1.76 million tons versus 1.84 million tons in the prior year period. Average delivered prices for export sawtimber increased 2 to 104.75 per ton versus 102.93 per ton in the prior year period, as higher shipping costs were partially passed on to export customers through increased prices. Average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber decreased 2 to 65.85 per ton versus 67.46 per ton in the prior year period. The decrease in domestic sawtimber prices was primarily driven by weaker domestic demand coupled with the decline in the NZ /US exchange rate (US 0.61 per NZ 1.00 versus US 0.62 per NZ 1.00). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices decreased 1 versus the prior year period. Year-to-date non-

Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA of 33.7 million was 11 , or 4.2 million, below the prior year period. 
 REAL ESTATE 
 Third quarter sales of 30.1 million decreased 1.1 million versus the prior year period, while operating income of 8.6 million decreased 0.6 million versus the prior year period. Sales and operating income decreased versus the prior year period due to lower acres sold (2,916 acres sold versus 4,281 acres sold in the prior year period), partially offset by higher weighted-average prices 8,835 per acre versus 5,781 per acre in the prior year period). 
 Improved Development sales of 12.0 million included 7.9 million from the Wildlight development project north of Jacksonville, Florida, 3.6 million from the Heartwood development project south of Savannah, Georgia, and 0.5 million from the sale of an industrial-use parcel in Kitsap County, Washington 266,000 per acre). Sales in Wildlight consisted of two residential pod sales totaling 104 acres for 7.7 million 74,000 per acre) and two small non-residential sales totaling 0.2 million.

 Year-to-date sales of 26.0 million decreased 8.7 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to lower volumes and prices. Sales volumes of 236,000 tons decreased 21 versus the prior year period. Year-to-date operating income and Adjusted EBITDA of 0.1 million decreased 0.3 million versus the prior year period. 
 OTHER ITEMS 
 CORPORATE AND OTHER EXPENSE / ELIMINATIONS 
 Third quarter corporate and other operating expenses of 10.5 million increased 1.1 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to 0.9 million of costs related to disposition initiatives and higher compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by lower professional services fees. 
 Year-to-date corporate and other operating expenses of 32.3 million increased 4.0 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to 1.6 million of costs related to disposition initiatives, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher IT related expenses. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

This compares to prior year period interest and other miscellaneous income of 21.7 million, which included 20.5 million of net recoveries associated with legal settlements. 
 INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT 
 Third quarter income tax expense decreased 0.5 million versus the prior year period. Year-to-date income tax benefit of 0.3 million versus income tax expense of 1.8 million in the prior year period was primarily due to a 1.2 million tax benefit associated with the pension termination and settlement. The New Zealand subsidiary is the primary driver of income tax expense. 
 OUTLOOK 
 In our Southern Timber segment, we now expect full-year harvest volumes slightly below the lower end of our prior guidance range due to the disposition of approximately 91,000 acres in Oklahoma as well as weather-related impacts in certain markets. In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we now expect full-year harvest volumes slightly below the lower end of our prior guidance range due to the disposition of approximately 109,000 acres in Washington. In our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect full-year harvest volumes in line with our prior guidance and lower carbon credit sales, softer export markets, and elevated shipping costs. In our Real Estate segment, we continue to expect strong fourth quarter closing activity, contingent on the timing of several large transactions. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our principal source of cash is cash flow from operations, primarily the harvesting of timber and sales of real estate. As an UPREIT, our main use of cash is dividends and unitholder distributions. We also use cash to maintain the productivity of our timberlands through replanting and silviculture. Our operations have generally produced consistent cash flow and required limited capital resources. Short-term borrowings have helped fund working capital needs, while acquisitions of timberlands generally require funding from external sources or Large Dispositions.

 The following table outlines common share issuances pursuant to our ATM program (dollars in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Common shares issued under the ATM program 400 Average price of common shares issued under the ATM program 34.03 
 CASH FLOWS 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 (millions of dollars) 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 173.8 208.9 Investing activities (74.8) (79.7) Financing activities (229.9) (134.2) 
 
 CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased 35.2 million from the prior year period, primarily due to lower operating results and changes in working capital. 
 CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash used for investing activities decreased 4.8 million from the prior year period, due to lower cash used for timberland acquisitions 10.4 million), partially offset by higher real estate development investments 0.3 million) and lower proceeds from other investing activities 5.2 million). 
 CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
 Cash used for financing activities increased 95.8 million from the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher repayments of debt 60.0 million), higher dividends paid on common shares 30.5 million), and higher distributions to noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates 5.5 million), partially offset by lower distributions to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership 0.1 million) and lower costs associated with the issuance of common shares under the ATM equity offering program 0.1 million).

FUTURE USES OF CASH 
 We expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, lease payments, capital expenditures, real estate development investments, timberland acquisitions, dividends on Rayonier Inc. common shares and distributions on Rayonier, L.P. units, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and repurchases of the Company s common shares to satisfy other commitments. 
 
 Significant long-term uses of cash include the following (in millions):

 We expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, the remaining issuances available under the Company s ATM Program, Large Dispositions and the use of our revolving credit facilities. We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. 
 
 EXPECTED 2024 EXPENDITURES 
 Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be between 79 million and 82 million, excluding any strategic timberland acquisitions we may make. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily consist of seedling planting, fertilization and other silvicultural activities, property taxes, lease payments, allocated overhead and other capitalized costs. Aside from capital expenditures, we may also acquire timberland as we actively evaluate acquisition opportunities. 
 We anticipate real estate development investments in 2024 to be between 30 million and 34 million, net of reimbursements from community development bonds. Expected real estate development investments are primarily related to Wildlight, our mixed-use community development project located north of Jacksonville, Florida and Heartwood, our mixed-use development project located in Richmond Hill just south of Savannah, Georgia. 
 Our 2024 dividend payments on Rayonier Inc. common shares and distributions to Rayonier, L.P. unitholders, excluding the additional dividend and distribution paid on January 12, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 29, 2023, are expected to be approximately 171 million and 2 million, respectively, assuming no change in the quarterly dividend rate of 0.285 per share or partnership unit, or material changes in the number of shares or partnership units outstanding. 
 Future share repurchases, if any, will depend on the Company s liquidity and cash flow, as well as general market conditions and other considerations including capital allocation priorities. 
 57 

We made cash contributions of 2.7 million in 2024 in order to fund the Defined Benefit Plan on a plan termination basis. Additionally, we settled the Excess Benefit Plan with lump sum cash payments of 1.2 million in 2024. We have no mandatory contribution requirements remaining in 2024. See Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans for additional information. 
 Full-year 2024 cash tax payments are expected to be bet ween 5.0 million and 6.0 million, primarily related to the New Zealand subsidiary. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We utilize off-balance sheet arrangements to provide credit support for certain suppliers and vendors in case of their default on critical obligations, and collateral for outstanding claims under our previous workers compensation self-insurance programs. These arrangements consist of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. As part of our ongoing operations, we also periodically issue guarantees to third parties. Off-balance sheet arrangements are not considered a source of liquidity or capital resources and do not expose us to material risks or material unfavorable financial impacts. See Note 11 Guarantees for details on the letters of credit and surety bonds as of September 30, 2024. 
 SUMMARY OF GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PERFORMANCE AND LIQUIDITY INDICATORS 
 The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance, liquidity, and ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes two measures of financial results: Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution CAD ). These measures are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), and the discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and CAD is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described above. 
 Management uses CAD as a liquidity measure. CAD is a non-GAAP measure of cash generated during a period that is available for common share dividends, distributions to Operating Partnership unitholders, distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchase of the Company s common shares, debt reduction, timberland acquisitions and real estate development investments. CAD is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital spending (excluding timberland acquisitions and real estate development investments) and working capital and other balance sheet changes. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to make strategic decisions about the business and that investors can use to evaluate the operational performance of the assets under management. It excludes specific items that management believes are not indicative of the Company s ongoing operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, the non-cash cost of land and improved development, non-operating (income) expense, costs related to disposition initiatives, timber write-offs resulting from casualty events and Large Dispositions. 
 We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income for the consolidated Company and to Operating Income for the segments, as those are the most comparable GAAP measures for each. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods (in millions of dollars): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Net Income 30.4 22.7 35.8 49.3 Interest, net and miscellaneous income 8.7 12.0 24.0 35.5 Income tax expense (benefit) (a) 0.6 (0.3) 1.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 33.5 37.0 106.7 114.3 Non-cash cost of land and improved development 9.8 6.6 19.2 20.2 Non-operating (income) expense (b) (11.5) 0.1 (3.3) (20.5) Costs related to disposition initiatives (c) 0.9 1.6 Timber write-offs resulting from casualty events (d) 2.3 Adjusted EBITDA 71.8 78.9 183.7 202.9

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks. We use derivatives in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Derivatives are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating, managing and monitoring resulting exposures. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk through our variable rate debt due to changes in SOFR. However, we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our term credit agreements by swapping existing and anticipated future borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 790 million of U.S. long-term variable rate debt outstanding on our term credit agreements. 
 The notional amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts with respect to our term credit agreements at September 30, 2024 was 700 million. The 290 million 2015 Term Loan Agreement matures in April 2028 and on August 1, 2024, three forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 200 million matured into active interest rate swaps and fixed 200 million of the outstanding principal over its remaining four-year term. The 2016 Incremental Term Loan Agreement and associated interest rate swaps mature in May 2026, and the 2021 Incremental Term Loan Agreement and associated interest rate swaps mature in June 2029. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to cover 100 million of borrowings under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Agreement through the maturity date in December 2027. At this current borrowing and derivatives level, a hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase/decrease in interest payments and expense of approximately 0.9 million over a 12-month period. 
 The fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk. The estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 was 468.5 million compared to the 523.4 million principal amount. We use interest rates of debt with similar terms and maturities to estimate the fair value of our debt. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in prevailing interest rates at September 30, 2024 would result in a corresponding decrease/increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately 24 million and 25 million, respectively. 
 We estimate the periodic effective interest rate on our U.S. long-term fixed and variable rate debt to be approximately 2.8 after consideration of interest rate swaps and estimated patronage and excluding unused commitment fees on the revolving credit facility.

The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, interest rate swaps and average interest rates, by year of expected maturity and their fair values at September 30, 2024:

 (b) Interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 (c) Average daily SOFR rate as of September 30, 2024 based on a 30-day look back period. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The New Zealand subsidiary s export sales are predominately denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore its cash flows are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the New Zealand dollar and the U.S. dollar. This exposure is partially managed by a natural currency hedge, as ocean freight payments and shareholder distributions are also paid in U.S. dollars. We manage any excess foreign exchange exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
 Foreign Exchange Exposure 
 At September 30, 2024, the New Zealand subsidiary had foreign currency exchange contracts with a notional amount of 123 million and foreign currency option contracts with a notional amount of 126 million outstanding related to foreign export sales. The amount hedged represents a portion of forecasted U.S. dollar denominated export timber and log trading sales proceeds over the next 36 months and next 2 months, respectively.
