 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 For the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 

shares of our common stock and payment to certain lenders of Scio of an aggregate of 
million in cash. In addition, we agreed to pay one-half of certain other unsecured operational liabilities of Scio. The transaction was
approved by a majority of the Scio stockholders voting in person or by proxy at a special meeting of stockholders held commencing on
July 12, 2019 and reconvening on August 6, 2019. The transaction closed on October 17, 2019. We recorded the fair value of the assets
purchased and liabilities assumed at million . 

The
assets and liabilities were valued using ASC 805 , the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination,
which requires the measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their acquisition-date fair values. 

Since
acquiring the assets of Scio, we have continued to further develop the technologies acquired from Scio, and we have begun producing diamonds
for fine jewelry and diamond material for industrial uses. 

On
April 17, 2024, the Company announced the establishment of a Board of Advisors for it s newly formed Adamas Technologies subsidiary.
Adamas Technologies was formed on November 9. 2023 and is responsible for research and development, partnerships and deployment of lab-grown
diamond-based solutions for the technology industry. The board consists of Jerry McGuire, the Adamas One Corp. COO and three technology
industry veterans. Activity during the quarter has been focused on planning, as the subsidiary intends to take Adamas One Diamond Technology
into high-tech industrial markets including semiconductors.

Settlements

 Change in fair value 

Balance June 30, 2024 

During
2023, the Company issued note payable agreements which contain conversion provisions meeting the definition of a derivative liability
which therefore require bifurcation. Further, pursuant to the Company s contract ordering policy, equity linked instruments subsequently
issued resulted in derivative liabilities. 

At
June 30, 2024, the Company estimated the fair value of the conversion feature derivatives embedded in the notes payable based on assumptions
used in the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial pricing model using the following inputs: the price of the Company s common stock of 0.4365;
risk-free interest rate of 5.50 ; expected volatility of the Company s common stock of 118 based on the historical volatility
of the Company s common stock; exercise price of 0.2586; and terms of three months. 

as of August 7, 2019. We completed our last annual goodwill
impairment test in our fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and as a result of the annual test management determined
that no change was needed to the carrying value of goodwill at June 30, 2024 or as of September 30, 2023. 

We
account for stock-based compensation at estimated fair value on the date of grant. There were 2,628,215 shares of common stock granted
to employees for one year s services and fully expensed during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. These were valued at an aggregate
of 1.5 million. 

There were 1,145,000 shares of common stock granted to employees for their
service. The price per share was based upon the market closing price on the day of the grant. The grants are fully vested and are recognized
upon the date of grant. 

and shares from the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the nine months ended
June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These shares are what would have been issued
if the convertible debt, plus accrued interest had been converted for each of the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncement 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40) ASU 2020-06 ).
ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible
instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB s simplification initiative, which aims
to reduce unnecessary complexity in US GAAP. The ASU s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 ASU 2023-09 ),
Income Taxes, which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures by expanding annual disclosure requirements related to the rate
reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption
is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company s disclosures. The new guidance eliminates certain exceptions to the general
approach to the income tax accounting model and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income taxes. The guidance
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of
the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements
have not yet been issued. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our condensed financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which replaces the current
incurred loss impairment methodology for most financial assets with the current expected credit loss, or CECL, methodology. The series
of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than
incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The guidance should
be applied on either a prospective transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our condensed financial statements, but since we have yet to
recognize revenue, adoption is not anticipated to have a material effect. 

million and million , respectively. As of September 30, 2023, finished products and work in process
were million and million , respectively. There was no inventory obsolescence in the nine months period ended June 30, 2024. 

and respectively. Depreciation expense for the
three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 totaled and , respectively. 

Leases 

As
the Company s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the estimated collateralized incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use
in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based
on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments
for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is the rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include
options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding
right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company s lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

We
are obligated under a triple-net operating lease for our 6,475 square foot manufacturing facility located in Greenville, South Carolina,
which is classified as an operating lease. The terms of the lease require a payment of approximately 10,680 per month, which includes
an estimate for utilities, taxes, and repairs. This lease expires in August 2028. 

We believe this facility will be adequate
to meet our current needs based on the property and equipment currently owned. On April 1, 2023, we had entered into a lease to expand
our manufacturing footprint in Greenville, South Carolina. On April 1. 2024, we terminated the lease in a mutual agreement with our former
landlord, as we reassess the locations for future growth. In addition, we have a lease for 3,414 square feet of office space in Scottsdale,
Arizona, expiring in September 2024. The office is to facilitate the administration and marketing of expanding the manufacturing aspect
of our company as well as to administer increased management anticipated in areas of human resources, finance, accounting, and financial
analysis as well as sales and marketing to manage the growth in the production output as a result of the second facility in Greenville,
South Carolina. We intend to pay for these improvements using a combination of working capital, new debt financing, and equity offerings. 

The weighted average remaining lease term and weighted
average discount rate for operating leases were 1.5 years and 8 , respectively. The operating lease cost for the nine months ended June
30, 2024 was approximately 230,000.

Employment
Agreements 

We
have entered into five separate employment agreements that provide for stock to be issued annually in varying amounts through fiscal
2025. The price per share to be included in employee stock compensation expense will be based upon the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant. The grants are fully vested, pending the service requirement of continued employment. 

Additional
Compensation 

In
addition to the above stock commitments, we have agreed to provide certain executive officers with compensation paid in diamonds.
These commitments amount to issuing 9.5 carats of diamonds per month through September 2024 and 2.5 carats of diamonds per month
through October 2025. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 this obligation has been accrued at a valuation of
 1,000 per carat, which is based on management s estimate of the market value of the diamonds. 

Litigation 

During
December 2022, we became a party to a class action filing previously between Scio and a class action investor. We have retained outside
counsel specifically for this matter and are working with other defendants named in this matter to increase our chance of prevailing.
On February 17, 2022 the Company filed a motion to dismiss the class action in concert with Scio which filed a separate motion to dismiss
this class action. Our approach will continue to seek a dismissal on all items related to this legal action. We believe the case is without
merit and will defend our position vigorously. Based on the Company s assessment of a favorable decision by the court no liability
has been recorded on our balance sheet at June 30, 2024. 

The
Company retained outside counsel and filed a motion to dismiss and joined in Scio s motion to dismiss on February 17, 2023. Specifically,
the Company believes it was mis-joined to the lawsuit and that no claims are adequately pled against it. The Company further contended
the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The case was re-assigned to Hon. Cristina D. Silva. Judge Silva s on July 5, 2023.
On June 14, 2024, the court ordered an additional briefing based on the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. The briefing was to commence on June 28, 2024, however, as a result of the court s inclination to grant the Company s
motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the claims against the Company, Mr. Grdina, and Scio s management and filed
a voluntary dismissal of all of the claims as of June 28, 2024. 

On July 31, 2023, we entered into
a note with a private lender with an original principal balance of 250,000 and an original maturity date 45 days after the effective
date. The note contains a fixed interest rate of 5,000 shares of common stock which is payable at maturity along with the outstanding
principal balance. As an inducement to enter into the note 25,000 shares of the Company s common stock was issued upon the acceptance
of this note by the private lender. On March 22, 2024, an extension was granted effective as of September 30, 2023, with an extension
until December 31, 2024 in return for an interest rate of 5,000 shares of common stock per week. The principal balance outstanding on
the note at June 30, 2024 was 250,000, and as of June 30, 2024, all interest shares have been issued. 

On
June 9, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a lender with an original principal balance of 1,635,000 and an original
maturity date 12 months after the effective date. The note contains an interest rate of 8 which is payable according to a schedule of
seven monthly amortization payments beginning on December 9, 2023 with final payment and accrued interest due on at maturity along with
the outstanding principal balance due on June 9, 2024. The securities purchase agreement contained an original issue discount of 180,300
which is being amortized as interest expense over the turn of the agreement. As an inducement to enter into the note 200,000 shares of
the Company s common stock was issued upon the effective date of this note to the lender. The note also included a 5 year warrant
to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of 2.50 per share. The Company determined that the fair value
of these warrants at the time the agreement was executed to be 76,403 which is being amortized as interest expense over the term of
the agreement. The note does not provide for prepayment or repayment of the principal balance and is required to be repaid according
to an agreed upon amortization schedule. The note is convertible in full or part at a rate of 2.00 per share. The note is also convertible
in part or in total into common shares of the Company at 2.00 per share. The agreement contains an escrow agreement for 2,752,000 shares

Overview 

We
are a high-tech, laboratory grown, diamond company that uses our proprietary technology to produce high-quality, single crystal diamonds
and diamond materials through a CVD process, which we refer to as our Diamond Technology . Lab-grown diamonds have the exact
physical, chemical, and optical properties of the best mined diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are composed of a pure carbon lattice, just
like mined diamonds, and are not considered synthetic or simulant diamonds like cubic zirconia and moissanite. Simulants are other chemical
compounds that resemble diamonds but do not possess the same hardness, thermal characteristics, band gap energy, and light reflectivity
as diamond, whether mined or lab-grown. 

We
use our Diamond Technology to produce finished diamond gemstones that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for jewelry and rough unfinished
diamond materials that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for industrial uses. We are in the initial phases of commercializing diamonds
and diamond materials, and our primary mission is the development of a profitable and sustainable commercial production model for the
manufacture and sale of diamonds and diamond materials, which are suitable for known, emerging, and anticipated industrial, technology,
and consumer applications. 

Since
acquiring the Scio assets over three years ago, we have focused our efforts on research and development of improvements to the fundamental
CVD process. Like most high-tech manufacturers, the philosophy of continuous improvement is at our core. Our development efforts have
focused on commercialization of the diamonds and diamond materials we produce, improvements in our white diamond process, improvements
in our diamond seed processes, automation in our machine operation, expansion of our capacity with our existing machines, and improvements
in our laser cutting procedures. The guiding principle of these efforts is to provide the highest quality diamonds and diamond materials
in a consistent and high-yield manner. 

We
currently have limited available commercial products and have to date sold minimal diamonds or diamond materials to consumers or commercial
buyers. Our current operations, until just recently, have been dedicated to the research and development of our Diamond Technology and
the exploration of markets that we may exploit in the future. While we are unable to predict the timing of our entry into any market
in the future, we will strive to produce on a large scale high-quality finished and raw diamond materials and to pursue related commercial
opportunities.

Components
of Results of Operations Net Sales 

During
the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we had net sales of 179,774 and 411,046 respectively, compared to 290,938 and 1,130,994
net sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. We anticipate deriving continuing future revenue from the following business
lines: 

Direct
Sales of Diamonds: The sale of diamond gemstones direct to the consumer through our website and the sale of industrial grade diamonds
direct to industrial manufacturing companies. 

Wholesale
of Diamonds: The sale of diamonds to wholesalers, distributors, and jewelers. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes direct costs (parts, material, and labor), indirect manufacturing costs (manufacturing overhead, depreciation, plant
operating lease expense, and rent), shipping, lab services, and logistics costs. 

Costs of revenues for the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2024, were 161,273 and 461,753 respectively. Costs of revenues for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023
were 217,844 and 397,842, respectively. 

Gross Profit (Loss) 

Gross Profit (Loss) for the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2024, was 18,500 and (50,707) respectively with a gross margin on diamond sales of 47 and (12.3) for each
of those periods, respectively. Gross Profit (Loss)for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, was 73,094 and 733,152, respectively
with a gross profit margin on diamond sales of 25 and 65 for each of those periods, respectively. 

Research
and Development Expense 

We
conduct research and development activities to enhance existing processes and products and develop new processes and products at our
facilities in Greenville, South Carolina, utilizing our personnel and strategic relationships. We expense all costs associated with our
research and development efforts through either our cost of goods sold, as they are performed by the same employees who produce our finished
product, or through our general and administrative expenses if the product has not been brought to market. 

We
expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
activities to achieve our operational and commercial goals. 

Operating
Expense 

Operating
expense includes selling, general and administrative expense, employee salaries and related expense and depreciation and amortization
expense. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and professional, consulting services and all non-personnel-related
expenses or depreciation and amortization. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation.
Depreciation and amortization expenses are related to the Company s fixed assets and intangible assets. 

Operating
expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, included in the condensed statements of operations was 1.9 million and 7.5
million, respectively, compared to 4.5 million and 16.9 million in the prior period. These decreases in operating expenses for both
the three- and nine-month periods were generally due to the lower stock compensation expense as a result of a lower valuation based on
price of the stock at the time of grant. 

We
expect our future operating expense to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount and expenses with the growth of our
business, build out our manufacturing facilities, refine our production processes, drive for productivity improvements, acquire new and
retain existing customers, and incur additional costs as a result of being a public company. 

18 

Other
Expenses 

Interest
Expense and Other Costs of Financing 

Interest expense consists of interest
paid and accrued on our notes payable, promissory notes and the amortization of debt issue costs. 

Interest and other expenses were 0.3
million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to .1 million and 2.3 million the
three- and nine-month periods of the prior year. This was due primarily to the higher costs associated with new financings and lower overall
borrowings for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, versus the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

Primarily as a result of the above factors
we had a net loss of 2.2 million and 10.1 million compared to a net loss of 4.5 million and 18.5 million for the three and nine months
ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2024, we had 16,102
of cash and cash equivalents compared to 26,088 at September 30, 2023. 

Changes in cash flows are summarized
as follows: 

Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended June 30,
2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately 2.1 million. This was primarily the result of a net loss of approximately
 10.1 million, increases to our period end accounts accrued liabilities of 1.2 million, an increase in our accrued interest of 0.5 million,
a increase in derivative liability of 1.1 million, a decrease with an offset by the benefit of non-cash expenses for employee stock compensation
and consultants compensation of 3.7 million and warrants issued for conversion of 0.9 million. 

For the nine months ended June 30, 2023,
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately 6.1 million. This was primarily the result of net loss of approximately 18.5
million offset by the benefit of non-cash expenses for employee stock compensation of 9.9 million. 

Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2024, we used no cash for investing activities. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we used 1.5 million for investing activities
related to purchase of property and equipment. 

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2024, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 2.1 million. This was primarily the result of additional borrowings. 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 8.1 million. This was the net effect of 9.1 million we received as net proceeds
from our IPO which closed on December 14, 2022 offset by 0.6 million used to reduce related party notes and 1.2 million to acquire treasury
stock during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern for the ensuing year. Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph in
their audit opinion in regard to this uncertainty and can be found in the Company s Annual Form 10K filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. 

Satisfaction
of our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months 

Our
IPO which closed on December 14, 2022, gave us gross proceeds of 11.0 million before direct IPO expenses and fees associated with underwriting.
These funds along with the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing are anticipated to meet
our operating needs. We are not currently generating sufficient revenue to meet operating needs. In the event we cannot obtain additional
capital to pursue our strategic plan, however, this would materially impact our ability to continue as a going concern. 

19 

Since
inception, we have financed cash flow requirements through debt financing and the private issuance of common stock for cash and services
along with advances from our CEO as well as our CEO and CFO deferring significant compensation and benefits that were earned under their
respective employment contracts. If we continue to experience cash flow deficiencies, we would be required to obtain additional financing
to fund operations through private common stock offerings and debt borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital. However,
there is no assurance we would be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

We
intend to implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continue to develop, and upgrade technology and products,
respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
made in preparing the condensed financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of deferred
tax assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and stock-based compensation. A summary of our critical
accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, under Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no significant changes to these policies
during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they
will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Our controls were ineffective due to the size of the Company and available resources. There are limited personnel to assist with the
accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be
adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information
presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the nine months ended June
30, 2024, and 2023 in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes
in internal controls 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during
the quarterly period from April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are involved in or subject to, or may become involved in or subject to, routine litigation, claims, disputes, proceedings, and investigations
in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty,
in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred,
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

On
January 10, 2023, the Company was joined as a defendant to an existing lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada (case no. 2:22-cv-00256) between Theodorus Strous, a shareholder of Scio Diamond Technology Corp. Scio ), and Scio
executives, brought as a proposed derivative shareholder class action. The second amended complaint added the Company and John G. Grdina
as defendants, expanding the claim to assert a proposed derivative shareholder class action against the Company as well as Scio. 

The
Company retained outside counsel and filed a motion to dismiss and joined in Scio s motion to dismiss on February 17, 2023. Specifically,
the Company believes it was mis-joined to the lawsuit and that no claims are adequately pled against it. The Company further contended
the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The case was re-assigned to Hon. Cristina D. Silva. Judge Silva s on July 5, 2023.
On June 14, 2024, the court ordered additional briefing based on the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
The briefing was to commence on June 28, 2024, however, as a result of the court s inclination to grant the Company s motion
to dismiss, the Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the claims against the Company, Mr. Grdina, and Scio s management and filed a voluntary
dismissal of all of the claims as of June 28, 2024. 

Please
reference the Contingencies section of Note 3 of our Condensed Financial Statements for additional disclosure.
