 Capital Southwest Equity Investments, Inc. (the Taxable Subsidiary ), Capital Southwest SPV LLC SPV ), and Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP SBIC I are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and are consolidated in its financial statements. The Taxable Subsidiary was formed to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still allow us to satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90 of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. The Taxable Subsidiary has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates based on its taxable income. SPV is a special purpose vehicle that was formed to hold investments for the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below) to support our investment and operating activities. 
 
 On April 20, 2021, SBIC I received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA to operate as a small business investment company ("SBIC") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. SBIC I has an investment strategy substantially similar to ours and makes similar types of investments in accordance with SBA regulations. SBIC I and its general partner are consolidated for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), and the portfolio investments held by it are included in the consolidated financial statements.

 (2) securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; 
 (3) securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements; 
 (4) securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no readily available market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company; 
 (5) securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; and 
 (6) cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
 Additionally, in order to qualify for RIC tax treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things meet the following requirements:

 (2) derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships," or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities; and 
 (3) diversify our holdings in accordance with two diversification requirements: (a) diversify our holdings such that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and such other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of our assets or more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and (b) diversify our holdings such that no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S.

 of the CSWC investment portfolio consisted of privately held debt and equity instruments for which inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not readily available. Therefore, the Valuation Committee determines the fair value of our investments in good faith using Level 3 inputs, pursuant to CSWC's valuation policy and procedures subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Investment Valuation Inputs 
 
 ASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date excluding transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. In determining the principal market for an asset or liability under ASC 820, it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date. 
 
 The Level 3 inputs to CSWC s valuation process reflect our best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset. 
 
 The fair value determination of each portfolio investment categorized as Level 3 required one or more of the following unobservable inputs: 
 
 financial information obtained from each portfolio company, including unaudited statements of operations and balance sheets for the most recent period available as compared to budgeted numbers; 
 current and projected financial condition of the portfolio company; 
 current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations; 
 type and amount of collateral, if any, underlying the investment; 
 current financial ratios (e.g., fixed charge coverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and net debt/EBITDA ratio) applicable to the investment; 
 current liquidity of the investment and related financial ratios (e.g., current ratio and quick ratio); 
 indicative dealer quotations from brokers, banks, and other market participants; 
 market yields on other securities of similar risk; 
 pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company; 
 projected operating results of the portfolio company; 
 current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment;

 Changes in Fair Value Levels 
 We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. During the three and six ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no transfers between fair value levels.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, CSWC declared and paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of million, or per share per share in regular dividends and per share in supplemental dividends). During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, CSWC declared and paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of million, or per share per share in regular dividends and per share in supplemental dividends). 
 
 The determination of the tax attributes for CSWC s distributions is made annually, based upon its taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, any determination made on an interim basis is forward-looking based on currently available facts, rules and assumptions and may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions determined at tax year end. 
 
 Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the 20 maximum tax rate on dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital.

 1 The calculation of taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return each year. Final taxable income may be different than this estimate. 
 2 At September 30, 2024, the Company had long-term capital loss carryforwards of million to offset future capital gains. These capital loss carryforwards are not subject to expiration. 
 
 A RIC may elect to retain all or a portion of its net capital gains by designating them as a deemed distribution to its shareholders and paying a federal tax on the net capital gains for the benefit of its shareholders. Shareholders then report their share of the retained capital gains on their income tax returns as if it had been received and report a tax credit for tax paid on their behalf by the RIC. Shareholders then add the amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax to the basis of their shares. 
 
 In addition, the Taxable Subsidiary holds a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiary is consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiary. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90 of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to us. To the extent that our income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates. Where interests in LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiary, however, the income from those interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC tax treatment and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate an income tax provision as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. The income tax provision, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, if any, are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the cost of investments held by the RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes was million, with such investments having gross unrealized appreciation of million and gross unrealized depreciation of million, resulting in net unrealized depreciation of million. As of September 30, 2024, the cost of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax purposes was million, with such investments having gross unrealized appreciation of million and gross unrealized depreciation of million, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of million. On a consolidated basis, the total investment portfolio has net unrealized depreciation of million for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. 
 
 Valuation of Investments 
 
 The most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our investment portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, our investment portfolio at fair value represented approximately 94.0 and 94.8 of our total assets, respectively. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our investment portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities actually existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 
 Beginning as of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors designated a valuation committee (the "Valuation Committee") comprised of certain officers of the Company as its valuation designee to determine the fair value of the Company's investments that do not have readily available market quotations, subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors. Our Valuation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, reflects the fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 
 Interest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated quarterly for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding its ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of September 30, 2024, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 3.5 of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 5.4 of its cost. As of March 31, 2024, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 2.3 of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 3.9 of its cost.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, including an annual requirement to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or its disclosure. 

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION 
 
 The total fair value of our investment portfolio was 1,508.5 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,476.6 million as of March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 118 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of 1,522.7 million. As of March 31, 2024, we had investments in 116 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of 1,476.7 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, approximately 1,340.0 million, or 97.5 , and 1,310.0 million, or 97.4 , respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 99.3 and 99.1 , respectively, were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the weighted average contractual minimum interest rate is 1.38 and 1.28 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, approximately 34.0 million, or 2.5 , and 34.5 million, or 2.6 , respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at fixed rates. 
 
 The following tables provide a summary of our investments in portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands) Number of portfolio companies (a) 118 116 Fair value 1,508,507 1,476,561 Cost 1,522,664 1,476,703 of portfolio at fair value - debt 91.1 91.1 of portfolio at fair value - equity 8.9 8.9 of investments at fair value secured by first lien 89.2 88.7 Weighted average annual effective yield on debt investments (b) 12.9 13.3 Weighted average annual effective yield on total investments (c) 12.7 12.7 Weighted average EBITDA (d) 19,842 22,988 Weighted average leverage through CSWC security (e) 3.8x 3.6x 
 
 (a) At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had equity ownership in approximately 61.0 and 56.0 , respectively, of our portfolio companies. 
 (b) The weighted average annual effective yield of debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for CSWC's shareholders, but rather relates to CSWC's investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of CSWC's and subsidiaries' fees and expenses. The weighted average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates during the quarter for all debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments. As of September 30, 2024, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 3.5 of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 5.4 of its cost. As of March 31, 2024, investments on non-accrual status represented approximately 2.3 of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 3.9 of its cost. Weighted average annual effective yield is not a return to shareholders and is higher than what an investor in shares in our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. 
 (c) The weighted average annual effective yield of total investments is not the same as a return on investment for CSWC's shareholders, but rather relates to CSWC's investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of CSWC's and subsidiaries' fees and expenses. The weighted average annual effective yields on total investments were calculated by dividing total investment income, exclusive of non-recurring fees, by average total investments at fair value. 
 (d) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Weighted average EBITDA metric is calculated using investment cost basis weighting. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 12 portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted

 EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. For the year ended March 31, 2024, 12 portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. 
 (e) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Calculated as the amount of each portfolio company s debt (including CSWC s position and debt senior or pari passu to CSWC s position, but excluding debt subordinated to CSWC s position) in the capital structure divided by each portfolio company s adjusted EBITDA. Weighted average leverage is calculated using investment cost basis weighting. Management uses this metric as a guide to evaluate relative risk of its position in each portfolio debt investment. For the year ended September 30, 2024, 12 portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. For the year ended March 31, 2024, 12 portfolio companies are excluded from this calculation due to a reported debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio that was not meaningful. 
 
 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 
 We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio. The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment's expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company's future outlook. The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments. 
 
 Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. The investment generally has a higher probability of being prepaid in part or in full. 
 Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral. All new loans are initially rated 2. 
 Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The investment may be out of compliance with financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due. 
 Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired. 
 
 We continue to observe supply chain disruptions, labor and resource shortages, commodity inflation, elements of financial market instability (including elevated interest rates and volatility in the banking systems, particularly with small and regional banks), an uncertain economic outlook for the United States (which may include a recession), and elements of geopolitical instability (including the ongoing war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and U.S. and China relations). I n the event that the U.S. economy enters into a protracted recession, it is possible that the results of certain U.S. middle market companies could experience deterioration. We are closely monitoring the effect of such market volatility may have on our portfolio companies and our investment activities, and we have also increased oversight of credits in vulnerable industries to mitigate any decline in loan performance and reduce credit risk. 
 
 The following table shows the distribution of our debt portfolio investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024:

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The composite measure of our financial performance in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is captioned Net increase in net assets from operations and consists of four elements. The first is Net investment income, which is the difference between income from interest, dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses, net of applicable income taxes. The second element is Net realized (loss) gain on investments, net of tax, which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost. The third element is the Net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments, net of tax, which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio, compared with the stated cost. The Net realized (loss) gain on investments before income tax and Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, net of tax are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain, a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized to being realized. Conversely, when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security, an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs. The fourth element is the Realized loss on extinguishment of debt , which is the acceleration of unamortized deferred fees associated with amendments to the Corporate Credit Facility that trigger a debt extinguishment or, in relation to notes payable, the difference between the principal amount due at maturity adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and any "make-whole" premium payable at the time of the debt extinguishment.

 Investment Income 
 
 Total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 48.7 million, a 5.9 million, or 13.9 , increase as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income primarily consists of interest income, dividend income, fee income and other income for each applicable period. 
 
 The following table summarizes the components of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents 

 Interest income (including PIK interest income and amortization of purchase discounts and fees) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 46.1 million as compared to 39.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 22.2 increase in the average monthly cost basis of debt investments held by us from 1,150.2 million to 1,405.4 million year-over-year, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield on debt investments from 13.5 to 12.9 year-over-year. Dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.9 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the liquidation of I-45 SLF during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by an increase in distributions received from our equity investments. Fee income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.8 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in prepayment and amendment fees in the current quarter. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.4 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash balances held. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation) and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Interest and Fees on our Borrowings 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total interest expense was 12.6 million, an increase of 2.1 million, as compared to the total interest expense of 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our total debt from 5.42 to 5.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. This increase in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to an increase in SBA Debentures outstanding and the addition of the SPV Credit Facility. 
 
 Salaries, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) remained relatively flat as compared to the total employee compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total general and administrative expense was 2.6 million, an increase of 0.3 million or 11.3 , as compared to the total general and administrative expense of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to individually immaterial increases across several general operating expenses. 
 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income before taxes increased by 3.6 million, or 13.6 . Net investment income increased from the prior year period by 4.0 million, or 14.6 , to 31.2 million as a result of a 5.9 million increase in total investment income and a 0.4 million increase in income tax benefit, partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in interest expense.

 Investment Income 
 
 Total investment income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 100.1 million, a 16.9 million, or 20.4 , increase as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income primarily consists of interest income, dividend income, fee income and other income for each applicable period. 
 
 The following table summarizes the components of investment income for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2024:

 Interest income (including PIK interest income and amortization of purchase discounts and fees) for the six months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 92.1 million as compared to 76.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 23.3 increase in the average monthly cost basis of debt investments held by us from 1,128.6 million to 1,391.3 million year-over-year, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average yield on debt investments from 13.5 to 12.9 year-over-year. Dividend income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.2 million as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the liquidation of I-45 SLF during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by an increase in distributions received from our equity investments. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation) and general and administrative expenses.

 Interest and Fees on our Borrowings 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our total interest expense was 25.0 million, an increase of 4.9 million, as compared to the total interest expense of 20.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our total debt from 5.33 to 5.60 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to an increase to the base rate on our Corporate Credit Facility and the addition of the SPV Credit Facility. 
 
 Salaries, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) increased by 1.2 million, or 16.7 , as compared to the total employee compensation expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount year over year. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, our total general and administrative expense was 5.5 million, an increase of 1.0 million, or 21.9 , as compared to the total general and administrative expense of 4.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee and an increase in audit fees, as well as individually immaterial increases across several general operating expenses. 
 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, income before taxes increased by 9.9 million, or 19.2 .

 FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from operations, the net proceeds of public offerings of debt and equity securities, advances from our credit facilities and our continued access to the debentures guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (the "SBA Debentures"). Management believes that the Company s cash and cash equivalents, cash available from investments, and commitments under our credit facilities are adequate to meet its needs for the next twelve months. We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our credit facilities and future issuances of debt and equity on terms we believe are favorable to the Company and our shareholders (including our Equity ATM Program, as described below). Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and operating expenses. Due to the diverse capital sources available to us at this time, we believe we have adequate liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. We continually evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on the current circumstances. This "Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources" section should be read in conjunction with the notes of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, effective April 25, 2019, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing. The Board of Directors also approved a resolution that limits the Company s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166 , which became effective April 25, 2019. On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s asset coverage was . 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 15.0 million. During the foregoing period, our operating activities provided 7.3 million in cash, consisting primarily of 153.1 million from sales and repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies, partially offset by new portfolio investments made by the Company of 194.0 million. In addition, our financing activities used cash of 8.2 million, consisting primarily of cash dividends paid in the amount of 60.0 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the Equity ATM Program of 58.0 million and net borrowings on our Credit Facilities of 13.0 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 47.2 million. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 1.4 million.

 Equity Capital Activities 
 
 Equity ATM Program

On February 4, 2020, the Company (i) increased the maximum amount of shares of its common stock to be sold through the Equity ATM Program to 100.0 million from 50.0 million and (ii) added two additional sales agents to the Equity ATM Program. On May 26, 2021, the Company (i) increased the maximum amount of shares of its common stock to be sold through the Equity ATM Program to 250.0 million from 100.0 million and (ii) reduced the commission paid to the sales agents for the Equity ATM Program to 1.5 from 2.0 of the gross sales price of shares of the Company's common stock sold through the sales agents pursuant to the Equity ATM Program on and after May 26, 2021.

During the three and six ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares under the share repurchase program. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Because commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Additionally, our commitment to fund delayed draw term loans generally is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions, such as meeting certain financial performance hurdles or financial covenants, which may limit a borrower's ability to draw on such delayed draw term loans. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately 133.3 million and 140.1 million, respectively, in currently unfunded commitments (as discussed in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of September 30, 2024, the total unfunded commitments included commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 0.9 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For the letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, 0.4 million expire in February 2025, 0.3 million expire in March 2025, and 0.2 million expire in April 2025. As of September 30, 2024, none of the letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risk that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies in which we invest; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes, including an increase in market volatility; interest rate volatility, including elevated interest rates; inflationary pressures; legislative reform; and local, regional, national or geopolitical, social or economic instability. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is

Table of Contents 

 affected by fluctuations in various interest rate indices, including SOFR and Prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. Our interest expenses also will be affected by changes in the published SOFR rate in connection with our Credit Facilities. The interest rates on the October 2026 Notes, the January 2026 Notes, the August 2028 Notes and the SBA Debentures are fixed for the life of such debt. 
 
 In September 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 0.50 and has indicated it will consider additional rate reductions in the near term; however, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will not make upwards adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in SOFR are not offset by a corresponding decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to SOFR. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly assess our interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we were not a party to any hedging arrangements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 97.5 of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, 99.3 of which were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. Our Corporate Credit Facility bears interest on a per annum basis equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus 2.15 . We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50 to 1.00 per annum, based on utilization. The SPV Credit Facility bears interest at a three-month Term SOFR plus 2.50 per annum during the revolving period ending on March 20, 2027 and three-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.85 thereafter. SPV (i) paid unused commitment fees of 0.10 through April 20, 2024 and (ii) pays unused commitment fees of 0.35 thereafter, on the unused lender commitments under the SPV Credit Facility. The following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments), assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Basis Point Change Increase (decrease) in net investment income (in thousands) Increase (decrease) net investment income per share (200 bps) (21,129) (0.44) (150 bps) (15,847) (0.33) (100 bps) (10,565) (0.22) (50 bps) (5,282) (0.11) 50 bps 5,282 0.11 
 
 Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including future borrowings that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments or fees from borrowers. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the table above. 
 
 Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio.
