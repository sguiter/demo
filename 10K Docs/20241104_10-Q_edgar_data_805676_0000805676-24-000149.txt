Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain statements by Park included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, in Part I- Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, or in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations, estimates, or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations, estimates, and projections concerning future results or events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are often identified because they are not limited to historical fact or by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as expects, anticipates, envisions, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words and similar expressions. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements as a result of various risk factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of Park's 2023 Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC, for more information regarding those risk factors. 
 
 Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: 
 Park's ability to execute our business plan successfully and within the expected timeframe as well as our ability to manage strategic initiatives; 
 current and future economic and financial market conditions, either nationally or in the states in which Park does business, that may reflect deterioration in business and economic conditions, including the effects of higher unemployment rates or labor shortages, the impact of persistent inflation, the impact of continued elevated interest rates, changes in the economy or global supply chain, supply-demand imbalances affecting local real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters (including the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and associated sanctions and export controls as well as the Israel-Hamas conflict), and any slowdown in global economic growth, any of which may result in adverse impacts on the demand for loan, deposit and other financial services, delinquencies, defaults and counterparties' inability to meet credit and other obligations and the possible impairment of collectability of loans; 
 factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including changes in real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers and the success of construction projects that we finance; 
 the effect of monetary and other fiscal policies (including the impact of money supply, ongoing increasing market interest rate policies and policies impacting inflation, of the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury and other governmental agencies) as well as disruption in the liquidity and functioning of U.S. financial markets, may adversely impact prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, income from fiduciary activities, the value of securities, deposits and other financial instruments, in addition to the loan demand and the performance of our loan portfolio, and the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated balance sheet as well as reduce net interest margins; 
 changes in the federal, state, or local tax laws may adversely affect the fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of state and political subdivisions held in Park's investment securities portfolio and otherwise negatively impact our financial performance; 
 the impact of the changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including the regulatory landscape, capital markets, elevated government debt, potential changes in tax legislation that may increase tax rates, government shutdown, infrastructure spending and social programs; 
 changes in laws or requirements imposed by Park's regulators impacting Park's capital actions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases; 
 changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits, whether due to changes in retail distribution strategies, consumer preferences and behaviors, changes in business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors may be different than anticipated; 
 changes in customers', suppliers', and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness, and Park's expectations regarding future credit losses and our allowance for credit losses, may be different than anticipated due to the continuing impact of and the various responses to inflationary pressures and continued elevated interest rates; 
 Park may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent there are loan concentrations by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; 
 the volatility from quarter to quarter of mortgage banking income, whether due to interest rates, demand, the fair value of mortgage loans, or other factors; 
 the adequacy of our internal controls and risk management program in the event of changes in the market, economic, operational (including those which may result from our associates working remotely), asset/liability repricing, legal, compliance, strategic, cybersecurity, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with Park's business; 
 5 

competitive pressures among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures (which could in turn impact our credit spreads), changes to third-party relationships and revenues, changes in the manner of providing services, customer acquisition and retention pressures, and Park's ability to attract, develop and retain qualified banking professionals; 
 uncertainty regarding the nature, timing, cost and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of Park, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, FDIC insurance premium levels, pensions, bankruptcy, consumer protection, rent regulation and housing, financial accounting and reporting, environmental protection, insurance, bank products and services, bank and bank holding company capital and liquidity standards, fiduciary standards, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry; 
 Park's ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations; 
 the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the FASB, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory agencies, may adversely affect Park's reported financial condition or results of operations; 
 Park's assumptions and estimates used in applying critical accounting estimates and modeling which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; 
 the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions; 
 Park's ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and Park's reliance on, and the potential failure of, a number of third-party vendors to perform as expected, including Park's primary core banking system provider, which can impact Park's ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands; 
 operational issues stemming from and/or capital spending necessitated by the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems on which Park is highly dependent; 
 Park's ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks, including those of Park's third-party vendors and other service providers, which may prove inadequate, and could adversely affect customer confidence in Park and/or result in Park incurring a financial loss; 
 a failure in or breach of Park's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
 the impact on Park's business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of the adequacy of Park's intellectual property protection in general; 
 the existence or exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty as well as the effect of trade policies (including the impact of potential or imposed tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars and other changes in trade regulations, closing of border crossings and changes in the relationship of the U.S. and its global trading partners); 
 the impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S., European and Asian government debt and concerns regarding the growth rates and financial stability of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe and Asia and the risk they may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt; 
 the effect of a fall in stock market prices on Park's asset and wealth management businesses; 
 our litigation and regulatory compliance exposure, including the costs and effects of any adverse developments in legal proceedings or other claims, the costs and effects of unfavorable resolution of regulatory and other governmental examinations or other inquiries, and liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; 
 continued availability of earnings and excess capital sufficient for the lawful and prudent declaration of dividends; 
 the impact on Park's business, personnel, facilities or systems of losses related to acts of fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; 
 the impact of widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, regional or national protests and civil unrest (including any resulting branch closures or damages), military or terrorist activities or international hostilities (especially in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict) on the economy and financial markets generally and on us or our counterparties specifically; 
 the potential further deterioration of the U.S. economy due to financial, political, or other shocks; 
 the effect of healthcare laws in the U.S. and potential changes for such laws which may increase our healthcare and other costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; 
 the impact of larger or similar-sized financial institutions encountering problems which may adversely affect the banking industry and/or Park's business generation and retention, funding and liquidity, including potential increased regulatory requirements and increased reputational risk and potential impacts to macroeconomic conditions; 
 Park's continued ability to grow deposits or maintain adequate deposit levels due to changing customer behaviors; 
 6 

unexpected outflows of deposits which may require Park to sell assets at a loss; and 
 other risk factors included in the current and periodic reports filed by Park with the SEC from time to time. 
 
 Forward-looking statements should be construed in the light of such risks. It is impossible to predict or identify all potential risk factors. Consequently, readers should not consider the foregoing list to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward looking statement in this Form 10-Q are based on current information as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and Park does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.

 Investment securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023, were as follows: 
 
 Unrealized loss position for less than 12 months Unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer Total (In thousands) Fair value Unrealized losses Fair value Unrealized losses Fair value Unrealized losses Debt securities AFS: Obligations of states and political subdivisions U.S. Government sponsored entities' asset-backed securities Collateralized loan obligations Corporate debt securities Total 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Park s debt securities portfolio consisted of billion of securities, million of which were in an unrealized loss position with aggregate unrealized losses of million. Of the million of securities in an unrealized loss position, million were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. Of the million in unrealized losses, million were related to Park's "Obligations of U.S. Government sponsored entities" and "U.S. Government sponsored entities' asset-backed securities" portfolios. For non-agency debt securities, Park verified that the current credit ratings remain above investment grade. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the credit profile of each non-agency debt security and assesses whether any impairment to the contractually obligated cash flow is likely to occur. Based on these reviews, management has concluded that the underlying creditworthiness for each security remains sufficient to maintain required payment obligations and that changes in value are largely the result of changes in the yield curve, therefore, unrealized losses have not been recognized into net income. Management does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that management would be required to sell, the securities prior to their anticipated recovery in respect of the unrealized losses. Management believes the value will recover as the securities approach maturity or market interest rates change. 
 
 There was ACL recorded for debt securities AFS at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Additionally, for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were credit-related investment impairment losses recognized.

 Nonaccrual commercial loans are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the collective evaluation. Management s general practice is to proactively charge down loans individually evaluated to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Nonaccrual consumer loans are collectively evaluated based on similar risk characteristics.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 Management utilizes past due information as a credit quality indicator across the loan portfolio. Past due information at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is included in the previous tables. The past due information is the primary credit quality indicator within the following classes of loans: (1) overdrafts in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio segment; (2) retail loans in the construction real estate portfolio segment; (3) mortgage loans, HELOC and installment loans in the residential real estate portfolio segment; and (4) consumer loans and check loans in the consumer portfolio segment. The primary credit indicator for commercial loans is based on an internal grading system that grades all commercial loans on a scale from 1 to 8. Credit grades are continuously monitored by the responsible loan officer and adjustments are made when appropriate. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (graded a 1 through a 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher PD is applied to these loans. Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that require management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of Park s credit position at some future date. Commercial loans graded a 6 (substandard), also considered watch list credits, are considered to represent higher credit risk and, as a result, a higher PD is applied to these loans. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Park will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. Commercial loans graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonaccrual and Park generally charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording an individual reserve. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Certain 6-rated loans and all 7-rated loans are placed on nonaccrual status and included within the individually evaluated category. A commercial loan is deemed nonaccrual, and is individually evaluated, when management determines the borrower's ability to perform in accordance with the contractual loan agreement is in doubt. Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off.

 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 Management identifies loans as modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and Park has altered the cash flow of the loan as part of a modification or in the loan renewal process. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of the borrower's debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed in accordance with the Company s internal underwriting policy. Park modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, a term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or an interest rate reduction. 
 
 In some cases, Park provides multiple types of modifications on one loan. Typically, one type of modification, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another modification, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the loans included in the combination columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or an interest rate reduction. 
 
 The starting point for the estimate of the ACL is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. As a result, the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the ACL and a change to the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the ACL.

 Upon the determination that a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged-off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the ACL is adjusted by the same amounts.

 When Park sells mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, these servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. Park has selected the amortization method as permissible within U.S. GAAP, whereby the servicing rights capitalized are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future servicing income with respect to the underlying loan. At the end of each reporting period, the carrying value of MSRs is assessed for impairment with a comparison to fair value. MSRs are carried at the lower of their amortized cost or fair value. The amortization of MSRs is included within "Other service income" in the consolidated condensed statements of income.

 Mortgage Banking Derivatives 
 Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. In order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans, the Company enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when interest rate locks are entered into. These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated as hedge relationships. The fair value of an interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage loan is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Fair values of these mortgage banking derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest on the loan is locked. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in "Other service income" in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 , Park had million and million, respectively, of interest rate lock commitments. The fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives was reflected by a derivative asset of and at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis: 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as described below: 
 
 Individually evaluated collateral dependent loans: When a loan is individually evaluated, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Collateral dependent loans which are individually evaluated and carried at fair value have been partially charged off or receive allocations of the allowance for credit losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is generally based on real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral is then adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the customer and the customer s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Individually evaluated loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. Additionally, valuations for all collateral dependent loans are updated annually, either through independent valuations by a licensed appraiser or a VOV performed by an internal licensed appraiser, in accordance with Company policy. A VOV can only be used in select circumstances and verifies that the original appraised value has not deteriorated through property inspection, consideration of market conditions, and performance of all valuation methods utilized in a prior valuation. 
 
 Loans individually evaluated for impairment include all internally classified commercial nonaccrual loans. 
 
 OREO: Assets acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired. The carrying value of OREO is not re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis, but is subject to fair value adjustments when the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based on recent real estate appraisals and is updated at least annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
 
 Appraisals for both individually evaluated collateral dependent loans and OREO are performed by licensed appraisers. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of collateral. In general, there are three types of appraisals received 
 68 

Table of Contents 

discount to real estate appraised values which management expects will cover all disposition costs (including selling costs). This discount is based on historical discounts to appraised values on sold OREO. 
 
 Income approach appraisals typically incorporate the annual net operating income of the business divided by an appropriate capitalization rate, as determined by the appraiser. Management generally applies a discount to income approach appraised values which management expects will cover all disposition costs (including selling costs). 
 
 Lot development loan appraisals are typically performed using a DCF analysis. Appraisers determine an anticipated absorption period and a discount rate that takes into account an investor s required rate of return based on recent comparable sales. Management generally applies a discount to lot development appraised values, which is an additional discount above the net present value calculation included in the appraisal, to account for selling costs. 
 
 MSRs: MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. MSRs do not trade in active, open markets with readily observable prices. For example, sales of MSRs do occur, but precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. As such, management, with the assistance of a third-party specialist, determines fair value based on the discounted value of the future cash flows estimated to be received. Significant inputs include the discount rate and assumed prepayment speeds. The calculated fair value is then compared to market values where possible to ascertain the reasonableness of the valuation in relation to current market expectations for similar products. Accordingly, MSRs are classified as Level 2.

 The following table provides additional detail on those individually evaluated loans which are recorded at fair value as well as the remaining individually evaluated loan portfolio not included above. The remaining individually evaluated loans consist of 1) loans which are not collateral dependent, 2) loans which are not secured by real estate, and 3) loans carried at cost as the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows on each of the loans exceeded the book value for each respective credit.

 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations, estimates, or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations, estimates, and projections concerning future results or events, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are often identified because they are not limited to historical fact or by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as expects, anticipates, envisions, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words and similar expressions. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements, as a result of various risk factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of Park's 2023 Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC, for more information regarding those risk factors. 
 
 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (or "MD A") contains non-U.S. GAAP financial measures where management believes them to be helpful in understanding Park s results of operations or financial position. Where non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as well as the reconciliation from the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, can be found herein. 
 
 Items Impacting Comparability of Period Results 
 From time to time, revenue, expenses and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not result in the inclusion of an item as one impacting comparability of period results. For example, changes in the provision for (recovery of) credit losses (aside from those related to former Vision Bank loan relationships), gains (losses) on equity securities, net, and asset valuation adjustments, reflect 
 76 

Table of Contents 

ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as items impacting comparability of period results. 
 
 Management believes the disclosure of items impacting comparability of period results provides a better understanding of Park's performance and trends and allows management to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of Park's performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance taking such items into account. 
 
 Items impacting comparability of the results of particular periods are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. 
 
 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 Park's management uses certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to evaluate Park's performance. Specifically, management reviews the return on average tangible equity, the return on average tangible assets and pre-tax, pre-provision net income. 
 
 Management has included in the tables included within the "Items Impacting Comparability" section of this MD A information relating to the annualized return on average tangible equity, the annualized return on average tangible assets and pre-tax, pre-provision net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. For the purpose of calculating the annualized return on average tangible equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income for each period is divided by average tangible equity during the period. Average tangible equity equals average shareholders' equity during the applicable period less average goodwill and other intangible assets during the applicable period. For the purpose of calculating the annualized return on average tangible assets, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income for each period is divided by average tangible assets during the period. Average tangible assets equals average assets during the applicable period less average goodwill and other intangible assets during the applicable period. For the purpose of calculating pre-tax, pre-provision net income, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, income taxes and the provision for (recovery of) credit losses are added back to net income, in each case during the applicable period. 
 
 Management believes that the disclosure of the annualized return on average tangible equity, the annualized return on average tangible assets and pre-provision net income presents additional information to the reader of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which, when read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, assists in analyzing Park's operating performance, ensures comparability of operating performance from period to period, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of Park's peer financial holding companies and bank holding companies, while eliminating certain non-operational effects of acquisitions. In the tables included within the "Items Impacting Comparability" section of this MD A, Park has provided a reconciliation of average tangible equity from average shareholders' equity, average tangible assets from average assets and pre-tax, pre-provision net income from net income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that the annualized return on average tangible equity, the annualized return on average tangible assets and pre-tax, pre-provision net income are substitutes for the annualized return on average equity, the annualized return on average assets and net income, respectively, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 FTE (fully taxable equivalent) Financial Measures 
 Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. In the tables included within the "Items Impacting Comparability" section of this MD A, Park has provided a reconciliation of FTE interest income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that FTE interest income, yields and ratios are substitutes for interest income, yields and ratios, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses: Park believes the determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting estimates. The ACL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses over the life of an asset or 
 77 

Table of Contents 

an off-balance sheet credit exposure. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations of past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. However, this evaluation has subjective components requiring material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the expected loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and forecasted economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. 
 
 One of the significant judgments impacting the ACL is the economic forecasts for Ohio unemployment, Ohio GDP, and Ohio HPI. These economic forecasts inform the regression model used to calculate cash flows during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Additionally, multiple economic forecast scenarios are weighted to arrive at the quantitative reserve. Changes in the economic forecast or weighting could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 
 
 As noted above, in calculating the ACL, management weighs different scenarios, including a baseline (most likely) scenario and an adverse scenario. At September 30, 2024, management applied a 50 weighting to the baseline scenario and applied a 50 weighting to the adverse scenario. To create hypothetical sensitivity analyses, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100 weighting applied to a baseline scenario and a quantitative allowance using a 100 weighting applied to an adverse scenario. The adverse scenario assumes among other things that: (1) tensions with China and Taiwan increase, China briefly interrupts trade through the Taiwan Strait, the Russian invasion lasts longer than expected, and the Hamas-Israel conflict will lead to a wider conflict; (2) the FRB begins to lower rates, but at a faster pace than the baseline scenario; (3) Europe goes into a recession. Populism in Europe rises, raising uncertainties about the longevity of the Euro and causes financial stress to highly indebted nations; (4) the U.S. election in November 2024 results in a democratic President and a divided House of Representatives and Senate that will allow for policy status quo to endure. Political divide will be intense, causing business and consumer sentiment to decline sharply; (5) concerns about bank failures raise fears of further collapse in the banking industry, reducing consumer confidence and causing banks to tighten lending standards; (6) a recession occurs in the fourth quarter of 2024 and lasts through the second quarter of 2025 resulting in real GDP declining by 2.6 , unemployment rates rising to a peak of 8.3 in the fourth quarter of 2025, and the stock market falling 35 from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025. The adverse scenario also forecasts Ohio unemployment for the next twelve months to range from 6.9 to 9.5 . Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in Park's ACL of 26.1 million as of September 30, 2024 if only the adverse scenario was used. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, a corresponding 26.1 million decrease in Park's ACL would occur in a hypothetical scenario if only the baseline (most likely) scenario was used. 
 
 Refer to the "Credit Metrics and Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses" section of this MD A for additional discussion. 
 
 Pension Plan: The determination of Pension Plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees will earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension income/expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our Pension Plan. During the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Park exceeded the pension settlement threshold established in ASC 715-30 and recognized in income a pro-rata portion of the unamortized gain in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pension settlement gain). 
 
 Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include: 
 
 the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 
 certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; 
 the expected return on assets in our funded Pension Plan; and 
 the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings. 
 
 Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our Pension Plan expense and obligation.

 Park's deposits grew during the COVID pandemic and declined toward pre-pandemic levels throughout 2022 and 2023. In order to manage the impact of this growth on its balance sheet, Park utilized a program where certain deposit balances were transferred off balance sheet while maintaining the customer relationship. Park is able to increase or decrease the amount of deposit balances transferred off balance sheet based on its balance sheet management strategies and liquidity needs. The balance of deposits transferred off balance sheet has declined as overall deposit balances declined toward pre-pandemic levels.

Credit Metrics and Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses is the amount subtracted from/added to the allowance for credit losses to ensure the allowance is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses over the life of a loan. The amount of the provision for credit losses is determined by management based on relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. 
 
 The adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 resulted in a 383,000 increase to the allowance for credit losses. A cumulative effect adjustment resulting in a 303,000 decrease to retained earnings and an 80,000 increase to deferred tax assets was also recorded. Additionally, as a result of the adoption of this ASU and elimination of the concept of TDRs, total nonperforming loans decreased by 20.1 million effective January 1, 2023 and individually evaluated loans decreased by 11.5 million effective January 1, 2023. 
 
 The table below provides additional information on the provision for (recovery of) credit losses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net charge-offs were 7.1 million, or 0.13 annualized, of total average loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.3 million, or 0.04 annualized, of total average loans, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in net charge-offs for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 2.9 million charge-off related to one relationship that previously carried a specific reserve.

 The total allowance for credit losses of 87.2 million at September 30, 2024 represented a 622,000, or 0.8 , increase compared to 86.6 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was due to a 3.5 million increase in general reserves, partially offset by a 2.8 million decrease in specific reserves. 
 
 The total allowance for credit losses of 87.2 million at September 30, 2024 represented a 3.5 million, or 4.2 , increase compared to 83.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to a 6.0 million increase in general reserves partially offset by a 2.5 million decrease in specific reserves. 
 
 The increase in general reserves at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included a 1.7 million additional reserve related to Hurricane Helene, which impacted borrowers in Park's Carolina region. Park identified 148.1 million in loans to borrowers in the hardest hit areas of Asheville and Hendersonville North Carolina. This reserve considers the overall population of loans to borrowers in this area as well as the industries in which commercial borrowers operate. Management will continue to evaluate potential losses as a result of Hurricane Helene as additional information becomes available. 
 
 The decrease in specific reserves at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was primarily related to the charge-off of one loan relationship which carried a 2.8 million specific reserve. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets: Non-performing assets include: (1) loans whose interest is accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (2) loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments but whose interest continues to accrue; and (3) OREO which results from taking possession of property that served as collateral for a defaulted loan.

 Nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024 of 71.5 million represented a 1.2 million, or 1.66 , decrease from 72.7 million at June 30, 2024, and represented a 10.4 million, or 17.1 , increase from 61.1 million at December 31, 2023. A majority of the increase occurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and included the downgrade of a 5.6 million loan to a non-bank consumer financial company as well as several smaller downgrades. 
 
 Park classifies loans as nonaccrual when a loan (1) is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, (2) payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or (3) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days for commercial loans and 120 days for all other loans. As a result, loans may be classified as nonaccrual despite being current with their contractual terms. The following table details the delinquency status of nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Loans are classified as current if they are less than 30 days past due.

 Credit Quality Indicators: When determining the quarterly credit loss provision, Park reviews the grades of commercial loans. These loans are graded from 1 to 8. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (graded a 1 through a 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher PD is applied to these loans. Commercial loans graded a 6 (substandard), also considered to be watch list credits, represent higher credit risk than those rated special mention and, as a result, a higher PD is applied to these loans. Commercial loans that are graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonperforming and Park charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording an individual reserve. Certain 6-rated loans and all 7-rated loans are placed on nonaccrual status and included within the individually evaluated category. Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off.

The following table highlights the credit trends within the commercial loan portfolio.

 Commercial loans include (1) Commercial, financial and agricultural loans, (2) Commercial real estate loans, (3) Commercial related loans in the construction real estate portfolio, (4) Commercial related loans in the residential real estate portfolio and (5) Leases. 
 
 Park's watch list includes all criticized and classified commercial loans defined by Park as loans rated special mention or worse. Park had 73.0 million of collectively evaluated commercial loans included on the watch list at September 30, 2024, compared to 60.7 million at December 31, 2023, and 87.7 million at September 30, 2023. The existing conditions of these loans do not warrant classification as nonaccrual. However, these loans have shown some weakness and management performs additional analysis regarding each borrower's ability to comply with payment terms. 
 
 The increase in watch list credits during the first nine months of 2024 was largely due to a 17.5 million loan to a non-bank consumer finance company which was downgraded to special mention, partially offset by problem loan resolutions. The downgraded loan was current in respect to its contractual terms at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Park considers a loan delinquent when it reaches 30 days past due. Delinquent and accruing loans were 24.9 million, or 0.32 , of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 23.5 million, or 0.31 of total loans at December 31, 2023, and 16.3 million or 0.22 of total loans at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans: Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Park has determined that any commercial loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status will be individually evaluated. Individual analysis will establish a reserve for loans in scope. Reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans are typically based on management s best estimate of the fair value of collateral securing these loans. The amount ultimately charged off for these loans may be different from the reserve as the ultimate liquidation of the collateral may be for an amount different from management s estimate. 
 
 Individually evaluated commercial loans were 53.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 8.4 million, compared to 45.2 million at December 31, 2023 and an increase of 12.8 million, compared to 40.8 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, Park had taken partial charge-offs of 5.1 million related to the 53.6 million of individually evaluated commercial loans, compared to partial charge-offs of 2.3 million related to the 45.2 million of individually evaluated commercial loans at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality: PCD loans are individually evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if a reserve is necessary. At September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses on PCD loans. The carrying amount of accruing loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 was 2.2 million and 2.8 million, respectively. The carrying amount of nonaccrual loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 was 548,000 and 534,000, respectively. 
 
 Additional Considerations: As part of its quarterly allowance process, Park evaluates certain industries which are more likely to be under economic stress in the current environment. The office sector continues to face challenges as it adjusts to the new normal of work from home brought on by the pandemic. Nationally, office properties in downtown and urban business districts are seeing the most stress. As of September 30, 2024, Park had 229.4 million of loans which were fully or partially secured by non-owner-occupied office space, 227.8 million of which were accruing. This portfolio is not currently exhibiting signs of stress, but Park continues to monitor this portfolio, and others, for signs of deterioration. 

Other Income 
 
 Other income increased by 8.8 million to 36.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 and increased 14.4 million to 91.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 77.1 million for the first nine months of 2023.

The increase for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in received death benefits as well as an increase in monthly income on the bank owned life insurance policies.

 Items Impacting Comparability (Non-U.S. GAAP) 
 
 From time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results relate to merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.

This compares to income tax expense of 8.8 million for the second quarter of 2023, which consisted of federal income tax expense of 7.9 million and state income tax expense of 920,000. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 18.1 , compared to 19.3 for the same period in 2023. Income tax expense was 24.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 and consisted of federal income tax expense of 23.7 million and state income tax expense of 868,000. This compares to income tax expense of 21.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, which consisted of federal income tax expense of 20.6 million and state income tax expense of 1.0 million. The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2024 was 17.9 , compared to 17.4 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The difference between the statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 21 and Park's effective income tax rate reflects permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from municipal investments and loans, qualified affordable housing and historical tax credits, bank owned life insurance income, and dividends paid on the common shares held within Park's KSOP, offset by the impact of state income taxes. Park expects permanent federal income tax differences for the 2024 year will be approximately 6.5 million. 

Comparison of Financial Condition 
 At September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 
 
 Changes in Financial Condition 
 
 Total assets increased by 66.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 to 9,903 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 9,836 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the following: 
 
 Loans increased by 254.8 million, or 3.4 , to 7,731 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 7,476 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Prepaid assets increased by 28.9 million, or 17.4 , to 194.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 165.9 million at December 31, 2023. This was primarily due to a change in the prepaid pension asset which was impacted by the remeasurement of the funded status of Park's pension plan as of September 30, 2024. 
 Total investment securities decreased by 195.8 million, or 13.7 , to 1,233 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 1,429 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 16.6 million, or 7.6 , to 201.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 218.3 million at December 31, 2023. Money market instruments decreased by 3.4 million and cash and due from banks decreased by 13.1 million. 
 
 Total liabilities decreased by 27.5 million, or 0.3 , during the first nine months of 2024 to 8,664 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 8,691 million at December 31, 2023. This change was primarily due to the following: 
 
 Total deposits increased by 172.1 million, or 2.1 , to 8,215 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 8,043 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Short-term borrowings decreased by 210.7 million, or 64.2 , to 117.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 328.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total shareholders equity increased by 94.1 million, or 8.2 , to 1,239 million at September 30, 2024, from 1,145 million at December 31, 2023. This change was primarily due to the following: 
 
 Retained earnings increased by 60.1 million during the period primarily as a result of net income of 112.8 million, partially offset by cash dividends on common shares of 51.9 million. 
 Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes decreased by 31.5 million during the period primarily as a result of a 18.4 million unrealized net holding gain on debt securities available-for-sale, net of income tax effect and a 13.1 million change in funded status of defined benefit pension plan, net of income tax effect. 
 Treasury shares decreased by 3.6 million during the period as a result of the issuance of treasury shares under share-based compensation awards (net of common shares withheld to pay employee income taxes). 
 Common shares decreased by 1.2 million during the period as a result of the issuance of treasury shares under share-based compensation awards (net of common shares withheld to pay employee income taxes), partially offset by an increase due to share-based compensation expense.

Table of Contents 

Increases or decreases in the investment securities portfolio, short-term borrowings and long-term debt are greatly dependent upon the growth in loans and deposits. The primary objective of management is to grow loan and deposit totals. To the extent that management is unable to grow loan totals at a desired growth rate, additional investment securities may be acquired. Likewise, both short-term borrowings and long-term debt are utilized to fund the growth in earning assets if the growth in deposits and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to do so. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 129.6 million and 97.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net income was the primary source of cash from operating activities for each of the nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 52.2 million and 121.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from the sale, repayment, or maturity of investment securities provide cash and purchases of investment securities use cash. Net investment securities transactions provided cash of 221.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 95.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Another major use or source of cash in investing activities is the net increase or decrease in the loan portfolio. Cash used by the net increase in the loan portfolio was 254.9 million and 203.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 94.0 million and cash provided by financing activities was 57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A major source of cash for financing activities is the net change in deposits. Deposits (net of off-balance sheet deposits) increased and provided 172.1 million and 10.0 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Another major source/use of cash from financing activities is borrowings in the form of short-term borrowings, long-term debt and subordinated notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net short-term borrowings decreased and used 210.7 million in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net short-term borrowings increased and provided 125.4 million in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash declined by 23.0 million due to the repurchase of common shares to be held as treasury shares; while there were no repurchases of common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Finally, cash declined by 52.3 million and 52.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the payment of dividends. 
 
 Effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of the Corporation, are met. Funds are available from a number of sources, including the capital markets, the investment securities portfolio, the core deposit base, FHLB borrowings and the capability to securitize or package loans for sale. The most easily accessible forms of liquidity, Fed Funds Sold, unpledged investment securities and available FHLB borrowing capacity, totaled 1.90 billion at September 30, 2024. The Corporation s loan to asset ratio was 78.07 at September 30, 2024, compared to 76.01 at December 31, 2023 and 73.49 at September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents were 201.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 218.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 223.6 million at September 30, 2023. Management believes that the present funding sources provide more than adequate liquidity for the Corporation to meet its cash flow needs. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 1,239 million, or 12.5 of total assets, compared to 1,145 million, or 11.6 of total assets, at December 31, 2023 and 1,086 million, or 10.9 of total assets, at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financial institution regulators have established guidelines for minimum capital ratios for banks, thrifts and bank holding companies. Park has elected not to include the net unrealized gain or loss on debt securities AFS in computing regulatory capital. Park has adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework as approved by the federal banking agencies. Under the Basel III regulatory capital framework, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Park must hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The amounts shown below as the adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer include the 2.50 buffer. The Federal Reserve Board has also adopted capital requirements Park must maintain to be deemed "well capitalized" and remain a financial holding company.

Park and PNB met each of the well capitalized ratio guidelines applicable to them at September 30, 2024. The following table indicates the capital ratios for PNB and Park at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 Leverage Tier 1 Risk-Based Common Equity Tier 1 Total Risk-Based The Park National Bank 9.76 11.35 11.35 12.77 Park National Corporation 11.43 13.33 13.15 16.50 Adequately capitalized ratio 4.00 6.00 4.50 8.00 Adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer 4.00 8.50 7.00 10.50 Well capitalized ratio (PNB) 5.00 8.00 6.50 10.00 Well capitalized ratio (Park) N/A 6.00 N/A 10.00

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 In the ordinary course of operations, Park enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include the funding of operations through debt issuances as well as leases for premises. See page 70 of Park s 2023 Form 10-K (Table 32) for disclosure concerning contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2023. There were no significant changes in contractual obligations and commitments during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
 
 PNB is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The exposure to credit loss (for PNB) in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. PNB uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Since many of the loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers. 
 
 The total amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk were as follows: 
 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Loan commitments 1,606,896 1,527,577 Standby letters of credit 35,644 31,261

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Management reviews interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis by modeling the consolidated financial statements under various interest rate scenarios. The primary reason for these efforts is to guard Park from adverse impacts of unforeseen changes in interest rates. With the shift in deposit mix and other balance sheet composition changes, Park has experienced a moderation in earnings risk exposure to either rising or falling interest rate environments, and management views its risk profile as being relatively interest rate risk neutral. Management actively monitors changes in the sensitivity position and has ample tools to adjust exposure as needed. As a result, management expects further changes in interest rates to have a modest impact on net income. 
 
 On page 69 (Table 31) of Park s 2023 Form 10-K, management reported that Park s twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap was a positive (assets exceeding liabilities) 782.9 million or 8.7 of total interest earning assets at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, Park s twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap was a positive (assets exceeding liabilities) 407.8 million or 4.49 of total interest earning assets. 
 
 Management supplements the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis with periodic simulations of balance sheet sensitivity under various interest rate and what-if scenarios to better forecast and manage the net interest margin. Management uses a 50 basis point change in market interest rates per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year in evaluating the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and net income over a twelve-month horizon. 
 
 On page 70 of Park s 2023 Form 10-K, management reported that at December 31, 2023, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would increase by 1.5 using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 1.9 using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At September 30, 2024, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would increase by 0.2 using a rising interest rate scenario and would decrease by 1.0 in a declining interest rate scenario. At September 30, 2024, management continues to believe that it has the tools necessary to mitigate gradual changes in interest rates (50 basis points per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year) such that the overall impact to net income will be modest. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 With the participation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer (the principal financial officer) of Park, Park s management has evaluated the effectiveness of Park s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Based on that evaluation, Park s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Park s Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer have concluded that: 
 
 information required to be disclosed by Park in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other reports that Park files or submits under the Exchange Act would be accumulated and communicated to Park s management, including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; 
 information required to be disclosed by Park in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other reports that Park files or submits under the Exchange Act would be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and 
 Park s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in Park's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during Park's fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Park's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are routinely engaged in various litigation and other legal matters that are part of, or incidental to, our ordinary course of business and we have a number of unresolved lawsuits and open matters pending resolution. While the ultimate liability with respect to these matters and claims cannot be determined at this time, we believe that losses, damages, or liabilities, if any, and other amounts relating to pending matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause Park's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. In ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of Part I of Park s 2023 Form 10-K, we included a detailed discussion of our risk factors. All of these risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating Park's business and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Park's 2023 Form 10-K. Any of the risks described in Park's 2023 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. These are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
