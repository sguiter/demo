SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 AND
OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements give
our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. You can find many (but not all) of these statements by looking for words such as approximates, 
 believes, hopes, expects, anticipates, estimates, projects, 
 intends, plans, would, should, could, may or other
similar expressions in this Form 10-Q. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions; prospective products, applications,
customers and technologies; future performance or results of anticipated products; anticipated expenses; and projected financial results.
These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 operating expenses exceed our revenues and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future; 

our
 ability to obtain additional capital, which may be difficult to raise as a result of our limited operating history or any number
 of other reasons; 

competition; 

general
 economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us; and 

other
 factors discussed in this Form 10-Q. 

We
may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place
undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations
disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this
Form 10-Q that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make.
Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures
or investments we may make or collaborations or strategic partnerships we may enter into. 

You
should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to this Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that
our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Unless
otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms Stratos Renewables Corporation we, us, 
 our and the Company refer collectively to Stratos Renewables Corporation and its subsidiaries, if any.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial
statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain
statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c)
anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They
are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, anticipate, 
 estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, 
 expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these
words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. 

The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which
the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

The
 Company, we, us, or our, are references to the business of Stratos Renewables
Corporation, a Nevada corporation. 

Corporation
Information 

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 29, 2004 as New Design Cabinets, Inc. Prior to the closing of the Share Exchange,
as described below, we were an operating public company, attempting to establish a base of operations in the custom cabinetry and furniture
industry as a builder of specialty, custom designed cabinets and wine racks. From inception to the closing of the Share Exchange, we
had limited operations and generated a total of 61,900 in revenues from the sale of wine rack kits and the oversight of
various construction activities. 

On
June 15, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our custodian by Order Granting Motion to Appoint George Sharp as Custodian and For Temporary
Restraining Order on Order Shortening Time (Case No. A-21-835772-B, Dept. No.: 13) issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada
in and for Clark County (the Court Order ). Under his authority as Custodian George Sharp appointed himself as the sole
member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by resolutions of the registrant s Board of Directors
on June 15, 2021. On December 10, 2021, in recognition of the 50,000 cash invested and 50,000 in consulting fees accrued by George
Sharp for professional and regulatory fees to reinstate the registrant in the State of Nevada and to have the Company become current
in its filings under the SEC s recently imposed requirements for public companies operating under SEC Rule 15c2-11 that mandated
the filing of current financial and corporate disclosures to be submitted to OTC Markets by June 30, 2021 and to have OTC Markets declare
the Company current by September 30, 2021, the Board issued 300,000 shares of the authorized blank check 
preferred stock to George Sharp with 10,000 votes for each share of preferred stock to give voting control to Mr. Sharp.

 Table of Contents 

On
September 27, 2021 we filed a Motion to Require Written Proof of Claim on Order Shortening Time in the District Court of the State of
Nevada in and for Clark County under NRS 78.347, 78.675 and other applicable provisions of Nevada law seeking an order barring unasserted
claims against us and likewise barring all our creditors and claimants from participating in the distribution of our assets as set forth
in NRS 78.675. 

On
September 28, 2021 we filed a Form 10-12G/A which we withdrew on November 19, 2021 to allow us to clarify the rights, preferences and
privileges of our Series B preferred shares. We filed on December 10, 2021 a Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of
State to designate 300,000 shares of Series B preferred stock with the voting rights of 10,000 shares of our common stock for each share
of Series B preferred stock but with no rights of conversion into shares or our common stock. 

On
October 1, 2021 the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County entered an Order Granting Motion to Require Written
Proof of Claim requiring that any claimants and creditors of Stratos who fail to timely submit Proof of Claim as set forth in
this Order shall be barred from later presenting their claim to Stratos. On February 10, 2022, the District Court of the State
of Nevada in and for Clark County entered an Order that any and all claimants and creditors of Stratos are hereby barred from
presenting any claim to Stratos. 

On
July 6, 2022 the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, at the request of George Sharp acting as our Court appointed Custodian, entered
an Order Granting Motion to Cancel Shares of Stratos Stock on an Order Shortening Time on July 6, 2022. As a result of that Order, 219,673,603
shares of our common stock were cancelled that reduced the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock to 16,803,070. 

On
August 23, 2022 the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, at the request of George Sharp acting as our Court appointed Custodian, entered
an Order Granting Motion to Terminate Custodianship on Order Shortening Time. 

On
August 23, 2023, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares and 4,000,000 warrants to a company for 400,000 pursuant to a Stock Purchase and
Share Subscription Agreement. 

Our
principal executive offices are located at 3535 Executive Terminal Drive, Henderson, NV 89052, and our telephone number is (702)-840-4433. 

Our
accounting year end is December 31. 

Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination
with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business or be acquired should such a reasonable opportunity
arise.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related
notes. These estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on our financial statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. 

Critical
accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, we do not believe that there are any alternative methods of accounting for our
operations that would have a material effect on our financial statements. 

CORONAVIRUS
AID, RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our lack of operations. The pandemic may, however,
have an impact on our ability to develop business. For example, our efforts will be threatened by government shutdowns, supply and labor
issues and resulting economic downturns which the pandemic has historically caused. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Going
Concern 

The
independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our December 31, 2023 financial statements contained
an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Results
of Operations 

We
expect that our operating revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses will greatly increase in the next fiscal year when we identify
a potential acquisition target. Currently we only have nominal operating expenses to run the company and report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We have identified ourselves as a shell company until such time a suitable business can be acquired, and we sustain
operations. 

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred professional fees of 62,571 and 243,895 which mostly relate to the filing
of the required Securities and Exchange reports as well as costs to bring current the Company with required federal and state regulatory
filings as well as 145,000 related to shares issued for services. 

The
Company also issued 319,000 worth of common stock to related parties in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company incurred nominal expenses related to general and administrative items. 

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred professional fees of 9,883 and 198,196 which mostly relate to the filing
of the required Securities and Exchange reports as well as costs to bring current the Company with required federal and state regulatory
filings as well as 145,000 related to shares issued for services. 

The
Company also issued 319,000 worth of common stock to related parties in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company incurred nominal expenses related to general and administrative items. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company in June 2021 was recently revived by the State of Nevada. The Company had no operations for a period of 11 years prior to that
when they filed a Form 15. 

On
June 15, 2021, George Sharp was appointed as our Custodian by Order Granting Motion to (1) Intervene, (2) Remove Custodian, (3) Appoint
George Sharp as Custodian, and (4) for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on Order Shortening Time, Case No A-21-835772-B,
Dept. No. 13 issued by the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County (the Court Order ). Under his authority
as Custodian, George Sharp appointed himself as the sole member of the Board and President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company by
resolutions of the registrant s Board of Directors on June 16, 2021. 

Since
April 29, 2022, the Company has completed Securities and Exchange Commission filings to become a fully reporting company. They have brought
current state regulatory filings to be compliant in the State of Nevada. The Company has commenced the process to identify suitable acquisition
targets. The current operating expenses incurred have been to get to this point. Future operating expenses will be largely funded by
George Sharp until such time as the Company can raise the necessary funding to acquire a business and provide necessary working capital
to pay for the operating expenses of the Company. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 3,937,262. Our independent registered public accounting firm has provided a
going concern opinion on our most recent audited financial statements as of December 31, 2023. 

In
the future, we will need to consummate one or more capital raising transactions, including potential debt or equity issuances, and/or
generate material revenue from an acquired business or businesses to fund our operations. We may also issue shares of common stock, stock
options or other securities to compensate our employees or independent contractors.

upon our current operations, we will need additional working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. Further, if we are
able to close a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction to acquire an operating business, it is likely we will need additional
capital, including potentially as a condition of closing the acquisition. Because of the inherent uncertainties of the Company at this
stage, we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need, if and how we can raise capital or the type or quantity of securities we
will be required to issue to do so. In connection with a business combination, we may issue a significant number our shares of our common
stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock to the target s shareholders which will be dilutive to our
shareholders. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses during the next 12 months. Our ability to develop and implement our business plan will
be subject to a number of risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. Such
risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model; recognition of revenue sources; and the management
of growth.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management is required to apply judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the
period covered by this Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) has occurred
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

We
filed a lawsuit on December 14, 2022 in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada as Case No. A-22-862558-B seeking to cancel certain
shares of our common stock purportedly held by the following shareholders that were named as defendants in this case: Harbor Ridge Capital
LLC; Tapirdo Enterprises LLC; Kenneth Laurent; Mark Beychok; Lynn-Cole Capital Corporation; AMRMK, LLC; Corporate Communications Network,
Inc.; CCN Worldwide; JAB Holdings LLC; Blueday Limited; Horizon Capital Inc; and Salem Dasmal. Service upon the defendants was attempted
at the last known address provided to the transfer agent. However, none of the named defendants could be located at that address so alternative
means of service authorized by the District Court have been pursued and completed. The District Court granted our motion to cancel our
shares of common stock on August 16, 2023, and the District Court s Order cancelling those shares of common stock was filed on
August 17, 2023.
