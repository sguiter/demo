segment, which is online retail (e-commerce). 

The
Company was incorporated on January 13, 2015 under the laws of the state of Washington. On April 7, 2021, the Company was converted from
a Washington corporation to a Delaware corporation. 

In
2019, Hour Loop formed Flywheel Consulting Ltd. Flywheel ), a wholly owned subsidiary located in Taiwan, to provide business
operating consulting services exclusively to Hour Loop.

per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt
securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consisted
of cash and money market funds. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. 

The
 Cost of revenues line item in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations is principally inventory sold to customers
during the reporting period. 

Policy
for inventory allowance: The Company writes down the cost of obsolete and slow-moving inventories to the estimated net realizable value,
based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience, forecasted consumer demand and application of the specific identification
method. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was written down from the cost of inventories
to their net realizable values. Full inventory allowance is recorded for the inventory SKU not sold for more than one year.

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These funds
were classified as Level 1 assets within the fair value hierarchy and accounted for at fair value. 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 

i. 
 Level
 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 

ii. 
 Level
 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets
 and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

iii. 
 Level
 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions
 made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 

The
Company evaluated principal versus agent considerations to determine whether it is appropriate to record platform fees paid to Amazon
as an expense or as a reduction of revenue. Platform fees are recorded as sales and distribution expenses and are not recorded as a reduction
of revenue because the Company as principal owns and controls all the goods before they are transferred to the customer. The Company
can, at any time, direct Amazon, similarly, other third-party logistics providers Logistics Providers ), to return the
Company s inventories to any location specified by the Company. It is the Company s responsibility to make any returns made
by customers directly to Logistics Providers and the Company retains the back-end inventory risk. Further, the Company is subject to
credit risk (i.e., credit card chargebacks), establishes prices of its products, can determine who fulfills the goods to the customer
(Amazon or the Company) and can limit quantities or stop selling the goods at any time. Based on these considerations, the Company is
the principal in this arrangement. 

The
Company derives its revenue from the sale of consumer products. The Company sells its products directly to consumers through online retail
channels. The Company considers customer order confirmations to be a contract with the customer. For each contract, the promise to transfer
products is identified as the sole performance obligation. Transaction prices are evaluated for potential refunds or adjustments, determining
the net consideration expected. Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were recognized at a point in
time. Customer confirmations are executed at the time an order is placed through third-party online channels. For all of the Company s
sales and distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company s
performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment date. As a result, the Company has a present and unconditional
right to payment and record the amount due from the customer in accounts receivable. 

The
customer can return the products within 30 days after the products are delivered and estimated sales returns are calculated based on
the expected returns. The rates of sales returns were and of gross sales for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 

From
time to time, the Company offers price discounts on certain selected items to stimulate the sales of those items. Revenue is measured
as the amount of consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Consistent with this
policy, the Company reduces the amount of these discounts from the gross revenue to calculate the net revenue recorded on the statement
of operations. 

A
performance obligation, defined as the promise to transfer a distinct good, is the unit of account in ASC Topic 606. The Company treats
shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, not separate performance obligations. Costs for shipping and handling were 
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded as selling and marketing expenses. 

segment, which is online retail (e-commerce). 

The
Company uses the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the
internal organization and reporting used by the Company s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing
performance as the source for determining the Company s reportable segments. The Company s chief operating decision maker
has been identified as the chief executive officer of the Company who reviews financial information of separate operating segments based
on U.S. GAAP. The chief operating decision maker now reviews results analyzed by customers. This analysis is only presented at the revenue
level with no allocation of direct or indirect costs. Consequently, the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company s accounts receivable were held by
the Company s sales platform agent, Amazon, which collects money on the Company s behalf from its customers. Therefore, the
Company s accounts receivable are comprised of receivables due from Amazon and the reimbursement from Amazon to the Company usually
takes less than 7 days. 

The
Company s business is reliant on one key vendor which currently provides the Company with its sales platform, logistics and fulfillment
operations, including certain warehousing for the Company s net goods, and invoicing and collection of its revenue from the Company s
end customers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately and , respectively, of the Company s

Overview 

Our
Business 

We
are an online retailer engaged in e-commerce retailing in the U.S. market. We have operated as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com
 since 2013. We have also sold merchandise on our website at www.hourloop.com since 2013. We expanded our operations to www.walmart.com
in October 2020. To date, we have generated practically all of our revenues as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com and only
a negligible amount of revenues from our operations on our website at www.hourloop.com and as a third-party seller on www.walmart.com .
We manage more than 100,000 stock-keeping units SKUs ). Product categories include home/garden d cor, toys, kitchenware,
apparel, and electronics. Our primary strategy is to bring most of our vendors product selections to the customers. We have advanced
software that assists us in identifying product gaps so we can keep such products in stock year-round, including throughout the entirety
of the last quarter (holiday season) of the calendar year. In upcoming years, we plan to expand our business rapidly by increasing the
number of business managers, vendors and SKUs. 

Business
Model 

There
are three main types of business models on Amazon: wholesale, private label and retail arbitrage. Our business model is wholesale, also
known as reselling, which refers to buying products in bulk directly from the brand or manufacturer at a wholesale price and making a
profit by selling the product on Amazon. We sell merchandise on 

23 

Amazon
and the sales are fulfilled by Amazon. We pay Amazon fees for allowing us to sell on their platform. Our relationship with Walmart is
similar. We pay Walmart fees for allowing us to sell our merchandise on its platform. As stated above, to date, we have generated only
a negligible amount of revenues as a third-party seller on www.walmart.com . 

The
advantages of selling via a wholesale model are as follows: 

Purchase
 lower unit quantities with wholesale orders than private label products; 

Selling
 wholesale is less time intensive and easier to scale than sourcing products via retail arbitrage; and 

More
 brands will want to work with us because we can provide a broader Amazon presence. 

The
challenges of selling via a wholesale model include the following: 

Fierce
 competition on listing for Buy Box on amazon.com; and 

Developing
 and maintaining relationships with brand manufacturers. 

Market
Description/Opportunities 

Total
U.S. retail sales increased 2 to 7.24 trillion in 2023 from 7.09 trillion in 2022. Consumers spent 1,118.68 billion online with U.S.
merchants in 2023, which was approximately 15.45 of total U.S. retail sales for the year, compared to 14.66 in 2022. Amazon accounted
for nearly 37.6 of all e-commerce in the United States in 2023 and that makes Amazon the biggest ecommerce giant currently in the market. 

Formation 

The
Company was founded in 2013 by Sam Lai and Maggie Yu, and we were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on
January 13, 2015. In 2019, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flywheel Consulting Ltd. Flywheel ), to provide business
operating consulting services, exclusively to Hour Loop. On April 7, 2021, Hour Loop converted from a Washington corporation to a Delaware
corporation. With the vision, leadership, and software development skills of Mr. Lai and Ms. Yu, the Company grew rapidly. From 2013
to 2023, sales grew from 0 to 132,124,202. 

24 

Competitive
Advantage 

Among
more than 2.5 million active third-party sellers on Amazon, we believe we have two main competitive advantages: 

First,
 we have strong operations and sales teams experienced in listing, shipment, advertising, reconciliation and sales. By delivering
 high quality results and enhancing procedures through the process, our teams are competitive. 

Second,
 we believe our proprietary software system gives us an advantage over our competition. The system is highly customized to our business
 model; it collects and processes large amounts of data every day to optimize our operation and sales. Through advanced software,
 we can identify product gaps so that we are able to keep products in stock all year round. 

With
respect to our advertising strategy, we advertise those products that we estimate will have greater demand based on our experience. This
lets us allocate our advertising budget in a fashion that delivers positive value. We advertise our products on Amazon. We allocate our
advertising dollars prudently. This is accomplished by advertising items that deliver the most return for our advertising spending. We
monitor the items being advertised by our competitors. On the operations side, we constantly refine our processes based on learning from
historical data. The combination of managing the business operations effectively along with allocating our advertising budget to high
value items allows us to grow profitably. In cases where the advertising is fierce, we allocate the spending appropriately. Our strategy
for competing with larger competitors is to monitor their pricing and not compete with them when their pricing is low or at a loss. Competitors
sell at low prices or at a loss due to a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, their desire to liquidate inventory or achieve
short term increase in revenue. During these times, we avoid matching their prices. This strategy allows us to stay profitable. 

Our
Financial Position 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated net revenues of 31,075,498 and 29,152,360, respectively, and reported
net income (loss) of 469,647 and (15,056), respectively, and cash flow used in operating activities of 2,181,060 and 522,840, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated net revenues of 83,827,327 and 72,637,417, respectively, and
reported net income (loss) of 2,184,611 and (2,019,668), respectively, and cash flow used in operating activities of 1,231,885
and 3,947,280, respectively. 

As

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

We
generated 31,075,498 in revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29,152,360 in revenues in the same period
in 2023. This represents an increase in revenues of 1,923,138, or 6.6 . We attribute this increase to our continued growth and maturity
in our operating model, despite an overall e-commerce traffic slowdown and intense competition. Our total orders in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1,472,515, as compared to 1,344,876 orders in the three months ended September 30, 2023,
representing an increase of 9.49 . This surge in orders has played a pivotal role in driving the overall revenue growth. The substantial
increase in order quantity indicates a rising demand for our products, leading to a corresponding increase in revenue generated from
these sales. As a result, the increase in orders has directly contributed to the overall growth in the Company s revenues during
the period. The 9.49 increase in orders reflects strong customer demand, but our pricing strategy, including competitive pricing pressure
and discounts offered during the period, resulted in lower prices for products sold. As a consequence, even with the significant order
volume increase, the revenue growth was slightly shy of fully matching this proportion. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 14,036,187, as compared to 13,819,798 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of the merchandise sold and shipping costs, as well as estimated losses due
to damage to goods. 

26 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 16,317,468, representing a 1,053,651, or 6.9 , increase from the 15,263,817
of operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was caused by an increase in platform fees and fees
paid to Amazon. The Amazon fees are proportional to revenues. In 2023, Amazon made strategic adjustments to its Fulfillment by Amazon FBA fees and costs, which had a direct impact on our operating expenses. The increase in revenues in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023 drove the increase in platform fees and higher Amazon fees. 

Other
Expenses, Net 

Other
expenses, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 34,445, compared to other expense, net, of 46,253 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Total
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Total
comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 485,613, as compared with (27,088) for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total comprehensive loss was attributed to an increase in the Company s gross revenues
in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

We
generated 83,827,327 in revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 72,637,417 in revenues in the same period
in 2023. This represents an increase in revenues of 11,189,910, or 15.41 . We attribute this increase to our continued growth and maturity
in our operating model, despite an overall e-commerce traffic slowdown and intense competition. Our total orders in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 were approximately 3,864,609, as compared to 3,229,456 orders in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of 19.67 . This surge in orders has played a pivotal role in driving the overall revenue growth. The substantial increase
in order quantity indicates a rising demand for our products, leading to a corresponding increase in revenue generated from these sales.
As a result, the increase in orders has directly contributed to the overall growth in the Company s revenues during the period.
The 19.67 increase in orders reflects strong customer demand, but our pricing strategy, including competitive pricing pressure and discounts
offered during the period, resulted in lower prices for products sold. As a consequence, even with the significant order volume increase,
the revenue growth was slightly shy of fully matching this proportion. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 36,710,400, as compared to 36,331,604 for the nine months ended

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 43,919,716, representing a 5,223,177, or 13.5 , increase from the 38,696,539
of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was caused by an increase in platform fees and fees paid
to Amazon. The Amazon fees are proportional to revenues. In 2023, Amazon made strategic adjustments to its Fulfillment by Amazon FBA fees and costs, which had a direct impact on our operating expenses. The increase in revenues in the nine months ended September 30,
2024 over the same period in 2023 drove the increase in platform fees and higher Amazon fees. 

27 

Other
Expenses, Net 

Other
expenses, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 76,963, compared to other expense, net, of 137,332 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Total
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Total
comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,175,986, as compared with (2,039,553) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total comprehensive loss was attributed to an increase in the Company s gross
revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had cash of 1,194,239
and 562,612 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Our
primary uses of cash have been for inventory, payments to Amazon related to sales and shipping of products, for services provided, payments
for marketing and advertising, and salaries paid to our employees. We have received funds from the sales of products that we sell online.
The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

An
 increase in working capital requirements to finance the rapid growth in our current business; 

An
 increase in fees paid to Amazon and other partners as our sales grows; 

The
 cost of being a public company; 

Marketing
 and advertising expenses for attracting new customers; and 

Capital
 requirements for the development of additional infrastructure. 

Since
inception, we have generated liquidity from revenues generated by our ongoing business, from debt and from the Company s initial
public offering to fund our operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash. Our cash is held in the bank and covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ),
subject to applicable limits. Deposits are insured up to 250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt
securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consisted
of cash and money market funds. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. 

31 

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses - Accounts receivable are stated at historical cost less allowance for doubtful accounts.
On a periodic basis, management evaluates its accounts receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance for credit losses in
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326, credit losses based on a past history of write-offs, collections, current credit conditions, current economic conditions,
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The evaluation is performed on a collective basis where similar characteristics
exist, primarily based on similar services or products offerings. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023. The impact of the
adoption was not considered material to the financial statements and primarily resulted in new/enhanced disclosures only. A receivable
is considered past due if the Company has not received payments based on agreed-upon terms. The Company generally does not require any
security or collateral to support its receivables. The collection is primarily through Amazon and the collection period is usually less
than 7 days. The Company performs on-going evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for credit losses as the Company deems
necessary or appropriate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not deem it necessary to have an allowance
for credit loss. 

Inventory
and Cost of Goods Sold - The Company s inventory consists mainly of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined on a first-in-first-out basis. The Company s costs include the amounts
it pays manufacturers for product, tariffs and duties associated with transporting product across national borders, and freight costs
associated with transporting the product from its manufacturers to its warehouses, as applicable. The merchandise with terms of FOB shipping
point from vendors was recorded as the inventory-in-transit when inventory left the shipping dock of the vendors but not yet reached
the receiving dock of the Company. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise
inventory. 

The
 Cost of revenues line item in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations is principally inventory sold to customers
during the reporting period. 

Policy
for inventory allowance: The Company writes down the cost of obsolete and slow-moving inventories to the estimated net realizable value,
based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience, forecasted consumer demand and application of the specific identification
method. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 578,622 and 675,886, respectively, was written down from the cost of inventories
to their net realizable values. Full inventory allowance is recorded for the inventory SKU not sold for more than one year. 

Property
and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset
using the straight-line method. The Company elected to expense any individual property and equipment items under 2,500. 

The
majority of the Company s property and equipment is computers, and the estimated useful life is 3 years. 

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets - In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-17, if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (in use or under development)
is evaluated and found not to be fully recoverable (the carrying amount exceeds the estimated gross, undiscounted cash flows from use
and disposition), then an impairment loss must be recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over
the asset s (or asset group s) fair value. The Company did not record any impairment charges for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Leases
- Leases are classified at lease commencement date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease is a finance lease if
it meets any of the following criteria: (a) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease
term, (b) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (c)
the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (d) the present value of the sum of the
lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds
substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset or (e) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected
to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. When none of the foregoing criteria is met, the lease shall be
classified as an operating lease. 

32 

The
Company typically utilizes operating leases for its office space requirements. This means that the Company leases office space, categorizing
the lease arrangement as an operating lease. Under this arrangement, The Company does not hold ownership of the leased assets but instead
pays rent for the right to use them. 

For
a lessee, a lease is recognized as an operating lease right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability at lease commencement date. The
lease liability is calculated at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid by using the lease term and discount rate determined
at lease commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset is calculated as the lease liability, increased by any initial direct costs,
and prepaid lease payments, reduced by any lease incentives received before lease commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset
itself is amortized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method better reflects how the underlying asset will be used by
and benefits the lessee over the lease term. 

Fair
Value Measurement - Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, due to related parties and short-term debt at fair value or cost, which approximates fair value because of the short
period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held cash equivalents in a money market fund, Dreyfus Government Cash Management.
The value of the money market fund was 256,062 and 101,510 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These funds
were classified as Level 1 assets within the fair value hierarchy and accounted for at fair value. 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 

i. 
 Level
 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 

ii. 
 Level
 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets
 and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

iii. 
 Level
 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions
 made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 

Revenue
Recognition - The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC
Topic 606 ). The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not affect the Company s consolidated
financial position, or cash flows. There were no changes to the timing of revenue recognition as a result of the adoption. 

33 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, which provided a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts
with customers as follows: 

Identify
 the contract with a customer. 

Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract. 

Determine
 the transaction price. 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

Recognize
 revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied. 

The
Company evaluated principal versus agent considerations to determine whether it is appropriate to record platform fees paid to Amazon
as an expense or as a reduction of revenue. Platform fees are recorded as sales and distribution expenses and are not recorded as a reduction
of revenue because the Company as principal owns and controls all the goods before they are transferred to the customer. The Company
can, at any time, direct Amazon, similarly, other third-party logistics providers Logistics Providers ), to return the
Company s inventories to any location specified by the Company. It is the Company s responsibility to make any returns made
by customers directly to Logistics Providers and the Company retains the back-end inventory risk. Further, the Company is subject to
credit risk (i.e., credit card chargebacks), establishes prices of its products, can determine who fulfills the goods to the customer
(Amazon or the Company) and can limit quantities or stop selling the goods at any time. Based on these considerations, the Company is
the principal in this arrangement. 

The
Company derives its revenue from the sale of consumer products. The Company sells its products directly to consumers through online retail
channels. The Company considers customer order confirmations to be a contract with the customer. For each contract, the promise to transfer
products is identified as the sole performance obligation. Transaction prices are evaluated for potential refunds or adjustments, determining
the net consideration expected. Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were recognized at a point in
time. Customer confirmations are executed at the time an order is placed through third-party online channels. For all of the Company s
sales and distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company s
performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment date. As a result, the Company has a present and unconditional
right to payment and record the amount due from the customer in accounts receivable. 

The
customer can return the products within 30 days after the products are delivered and estimated sales returns are calculated based on
the expected returns. The rates of sales returns were 6 and 6.45 of gross sales for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 

34 

From
time to time, the Company offers price discounts on certain selected items to stimulate the sales of those items. Revenue is measured
as the amount of consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Consistent with this
policy, the Company reduces the amount of these discounts from the gross revenue to calculate the net revenue recorded on the statement
of operations. 

A
performance obligation, defined as the promise to transfer a distinct good, is the unit of account in ASC Topic 606. The Company treats
shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, not separate performance obligations. Costs for shipping and handling were 18,749,793
and 17,091,747 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded as selling and marketing expenses. 

Segment
Information The Company has only one segment, which is online retail (e-commerce). 

The
Company uses the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the
internal organization and reporting used by the Company s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing
performance as the source for determining the Company s reportable segments. The Company s chief operating decision maker
has been identified as the chief executive officer of the Company who reviews financial information of separate operating segments based
on U.S. GAAP. The chief operating decision maker now reviews results analyzed by customers. This analysis is only presented at the revenue
level with no allocation of direct or indirect costs. Consequently, the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment. 

Income
Taxes - Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. 

The
Company also complied with state tax codes and regulations, including with respect to California franchise taxes. Management has evaluated
its tax positions and has concluded that the Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that could require adjustment or disclosure
in the financial statements to comply with provisions set forth in ASC section 740, Income Taxes . 

Deferred
tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future
realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing
the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future
earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and
other relevant factors. 

Presentation
of Sales Taxes - Governmental authorities impose sales tax on all of the Company s sales to nonexempt customers. The Company
collects sales tax from customers and remits the entire amount to the governmental authorities. The Company s accounting policy
is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from revenues and cost of revenues. 

The
Company assesses sales tax payable including any related interest and penalties and accrues these estimates on its financial statements.
Pursuant to the Wayfair decision, each state enforces sales tax collection at different dates. The Company collects and remits sales
tax in accordance with state regulations. The Company estimates that as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, it owed 288,466
and 288,466, respectively, in sales taxes along with penalties and interest resulting from late filings. 

35 

Concentration
of Credit Risks - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various domestic and foreign
financial institutions of high credit quality. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of all of the
aforementioned institutions. 

The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. Significant customers are those which
represent more than 10 of the Company s total net revenue or gross accounts receivable balance at the balance sheet date. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no customer that accounted for 10 or more of total net
revenues. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no customer that accounted for 10 or more of
gross accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company s accounts receivable were held by
the Company s sales platform agent, Amazon, which collects money on the Company s behalf from its customers. Therefore, the
Company s accounts receivable are comprised of receivables due from Amazon and the reimbursement from Amazon to the Company usually
takes less than 7 days. 

The
Company s business is reliant on one key vendor which currently provides the Company with its sales platform, logistics and fulfillment
operations, including certain warehousing for the Company s net goods, and invoicing and collection of its revenue from the Company s
end customers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 99 and 100 , respectively, of the Company s
revenue was through or with the Amazon sales platform. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk - The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through its foreign subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company
does not hedge foreign currency translation risk in the net assets and income reported from these sources. 

Advertising
and Promotion Expenses Our policy is to recognize advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses
were 3,096,997 and 2,617,318 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Commitments
and Contingencies - Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other
sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred
in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. 

Related
Parties - The Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 850 (Related Party Disclosures).
A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls,
is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management,
members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may
deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of
the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties
and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing
its own separate interests is also a related party. 

Earnings
per Share - The Company computes basic earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. For the period in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to stockholders is
the same as basic net loss per share attributable to stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have
been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no dilutive securities or other items that would affect earnings per share for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Therefore, the diluted earnings per share is the same as the basic earnings
per share. 

Shares
Issued for Services Stock-based compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at
fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period.
