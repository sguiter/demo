The Series C Common Warrants together with the June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants are referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as the June 2024 Warrants. The securities were offered in combinations of (a) June 2024 Share or June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant, together with (b) Series C-1 Common Warrant and Series C-2 Common Warrant, for a combined purchase price of (less for each June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant).

 Based on the Company s current operating plan, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the middle of the first quarter of 2025. 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to fund its business activities, including its research and development program. The Company intends to raise capital through additional issuances of equity securities and/or short-term or long-term debt arrangements, but there can be no assurances any such financing will be available when needed, even if the Company s research and development efforts are successful. If the Company is not able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and in the amounts necessary to fully fund its future operating requirements, it may be forced to reduce or discontinue its operations entirely. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

The term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of the GRI Operations restricted stock awards otherwise remained unchanged.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies that target serious diseases associated with dysregulated immune responses leading to inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune disorders. Our goal is to be an industry leader in developing therapies to treat these diseases and to improve the lives of patients suffering from such diseases. 
 Our lead product candidate, GRI-0621, is an oral inhibitor of type 1 Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells. GRI-0621 is also an oral formulation of tazarotene, a synthetic retinoid acid receptor (RAR)-beta and gamma selective agonist, that is approved in the United States for topical treatment of psoriasis and acne. As of September 30, 2024, it has been evaluated in over 1,700 patients as an oral product for up to 52-weeks. We are developing GRI-0621 for the treatment of severe fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a life-threatening progressive fibrotic disease of the lung that affects approximately 140,000 people in the United States, with up to 40,000 new cases per year in the United States. Some estimate that IPF affects 3 million globally. While there are currently two approved therapies for the treatment of lung fibrosis, neither has been associated with improvements in overall survival, and both therapies have been associated with significant side effects leading to poor therapeutic adherence. In preliminary data from our trials to date with GRI-0621, and earlier trials with oral tazarotene, we have observed GRI-0621 to be well-tolerated and to inhibit iNKT cell activity in subjects. We and others have shown that activated iNKT are upregulated in IPF, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients as well as other indications. In these patients activated iNKT cells are correlated with more severe disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared our Investigative New Drug (IND) application for GRI-0621 for the treatment of IPF and we plan to evaluate GRI-0621 in a randomized, double-blind, multi-center Phase 2a biomarker study, for which we commenced enrollment in December 2023. Based on our current enrollment projections, we now expect interim data from this trial to be available in the first quarter of 2025 and topline results to be available in the second quarter of 2025. Additionally, we have received authorization of our clinical trial application from both the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration to initiate the Phase 2a biomarker study evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of IPF in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively. 
 Our product candidate portfolio also includes GRI-0803 and a proprietary library of 500+ compounds. GRI-0803, the lead molecule selected from the library, is a novel oral agonist of type 2 Natural Killer T cells and would be developed for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, with much of our preclinical work in SLE or lupus and MS. In lupus, the immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues, especially joints and skin, but can affect almost every organ and tissue of the body. The condition can be fatal, and often causes debilitating bouts of fatigue and pain that prevent nearly half of adult patients from working. Lupus affects between 160,000 - 200,000 patients in the United States, with around 80,000 100,000 patients in the United States suffering from kidney nephritis, one of the most serious manifestations of SLE, typically within five years of diagnosis. There is no cure for lupus, but medical interventions and lifestyle changes can help control it. SLE treatment consists primarily of immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit the activity of the immune system. Only two drugs have been approved for lupus in the past 50 years, and new treatment options are sorely needed. In order to focus our resources on our GRI-0621 program, we have limited our development of GRI-0803

 pending additional funding. Subject to obtaining the requisite additional funding and IND clearance, we intend to evaluate GRI-0803 in a Phase 1a and 1b trial initially targeting SLE. We expect to file an IND with respect to this Phase 1a and 1b trial in 2025. We expect to continue to evaluate indications to select the best fit for further development of the program, but our initial focus would be on lupus.

 Nasdaq Compliance - Stockholders Equity Deficiency 
 On November 22, 2023, we received a letter (the Notice) from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market based on the information provided in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires that companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market with a market value of listed securities of less than 35.0 million and annual net income of less than 0.5 million maintain stockholders equity of at least 2.5 million (the Stockholders Equity Requirement). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, we were provided until January 8, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement (the Compliance Plan). On January 22, 2024, the Staff granted us an extension until May 20, 2024 to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement. Per the Staff s January 22, 2024 letter, we must complete an equity offering to raise gross proceeds of at least 6.0 million and furnish to the Staff and Nasdaq evidence of compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement by filing a publicly available report prior to May 24, 2024. We completed multiple equity offerings with gross proceeds of 10.5 million and have met the minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. As such, on July 2, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that the stockholders equity deficiency under Listing Rule 5550(b) had been cured and that we were then in compliance with all applicable continued listing standards.

 Nasdaq Compliance - Bid Price Deficiency 
 The rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market also require that we maintain a closing price for shares of our Common Stock of at least 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Rule). On January 5, 2024, we received a letter (the January Letter) from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that we no longer met the Minimum Bid Price Rule set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the closing bid price for our Common Stock was less than 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The January Letter was in addition to the Notice described above. The January Letter had no immediate effect on our continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a 180-calendar day period, or until July 3, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Minimum Bid Price Rule requires that a listed company maintain a closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day period, unless Nasdaq exercises its discretion to extend such 10 day period. On January 29, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Charter to implement the January 2024 Reverse Stock Split to attempt to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, but were not able to regain compliance following the January 2024 Reverse Stock Split. On June 7, 2024, we filed an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the June 2024 Reverse Stock Split to attempt to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On July 2, 2024 and July 19, 2024, we received letters from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that we were again in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. 
 On September 10, 2024, we received a letter (the September Letter) from the Staff of Nasdaq, indicating that we no longer met the Minimum Bid Price Requirement because the closing bid price for our Common Stock was less than 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The September Letter had no immediate effect on our continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a 180-calendar day period, or until March 10, 2025 (the Compliance Date), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. If we do not regain compliance by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day period, subject to satisfying the conditions in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. If, before the Compliance Date, our Common Stock has a closing bid price of 0.10 per share or less for ten consecutive trading days, the Staff will issue a Staff Delisting Determination under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810 with respect to our Common Stock. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We are monitoring the closing bid price of our Common Stock and will consider options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 Merger with Vallon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 Financial Operations Overview 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and development activities, including third party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and manufacture drug supplies and materials. 
 Our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of costs related to our development program for our lead product candidate GRI-0621. These expenses include: 
 employee-related expenses, such as salaries, bonuses and benefits, consultant-related expenses such as consultant fees and bonuses, stock-based compensation, overhead-related expenses and travel-related expenses for our research and development personnel; and 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities as well as consultants that support the implementation of our clinical and non-clinical studies.

Table of Contents 

 Although our direct research and development expenses are tracked by product candidate, we do not allocate employee costs and costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies and facilities, including other indirect costs, to specific product candidates as these costs are deployed across multiple programs. We expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we conduct our planned clinical and preclinical activities for our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and consulting related expenses for executives and other administrative personnel, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including legal and accounting fees, travel expenses, facilities-related expenses, and consulting services relating to corporate matters. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we incur costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market and SEC requirements, directors and officers insurance, legal and accounting costs and investor relations costs, as well as an increase in personnel expenses as we hire additional personnel. 
 Warrant Liability 
 In May 2022, Vallon issued warrants (the May 2022 Warrants) in connection with a securities purchase agreement. Vallon evaluated the May 2022 Warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (ASC 815-40), and concluded that a provision in the May 2022 Warrants related to the reduction of the exercise price in certain circumstances precludes the May 2022 Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As a result, the May 2022 Warrants were measured at fair value upon issuance using a Black-Scholes valuation model and are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the May 2022 Warrants is measured at each reporting date and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. 
 Interest Income (Expense) 
 Interest expense consists of amortization of debt discounts, debt issuance costs and interest expense related to the Bridge Notes. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents held with institutional banks.

 General and administrative expenses were 1.0 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.3 million decrease was primarily related to a 0.3 million decrease in stock based compensation expense. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 The change in fair value of 0.1 million represents a decrease in the fair value of the warrants outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Income 
 Other income was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of payments received under the terms of the Aardvark Agreement entered into in August 2023.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 2.9 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.7 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to i ncreases of 0.7 million in expenses related to the development program of GRI-0621, offset by a 0.1 million decrease in personnel expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 3.3 million and 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 3.9 million decrease was primarily related to decreased costs for professional fees, including legal, accounting and investment banking fees as a result of the completion of the Merger of 3.3 million and a decrease in personnel expenses of 0.5 million as a result of a decrease in bonus expense.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have incurred losses and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of 6.3 million and 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 37.8 million. 
 We have financed our working capital requirements to date through the issuance of common stock, warrants, convertible notes and promissory notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.7 million in cash. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 6.6 million and 3.4 million were used in operating activities, respectively. The 3.2 million increase was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash adjustments of 2.1 million related to the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, 0.2 million related to stock-based compensation expenses and 0.2 million related to the change in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets, as well as a 5.0 million increase in accounts payable and a 1.7 million increase in accrued expenses, offset by a 4.8 million decrease in net loss and a 1.2 million increase in prepaid and other assets.

The increase was offset by 1.9 million of stock issuance costs. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily due to 12.3 million of proceeds from the Equity SPA and 1.3 million of proceeds from the funding of the second tranche of the Bridge

 Notes. These proceeds were offset by 2.9 million of net liabilities assumed in the connection with the Merger, 3.0 million in costs associated with the Merger, the payment of 0.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the Bridge Notes and 0.2 million of stock issuance costs related the Equity SPA.

 June 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 On June 26, 2024, we entered into the June 2024 Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold, in the June 2024 Offering), (i) 60,000 June 2024 Shares, (ii) 2,125,793 June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 2,125,793 shares of Common Stock, (iii) 2,185,793 Series C-1 Common Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 2,185,793 shares of Common Stock, and (iv) 2,185,793 Series C-2 Common Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 2,185,793 shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of 3.2 million, after deducting offering expenses of 1.1 million. 
 May 2024 At The Market Offering 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 2,387,296 shares of our Common Stock in the ATM Offering at a weighted-average price of 0.83 per share, raising 2.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of 1.9 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM Offering related expenses. On July 26, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279348) to increase the amount of shares of Common Stock that we may offer and sell under the Sales Agreement and applicable registration statement to an aggregate offering price of up to 2.6 million, which amount does not include the shares of Common Stock having an aggregate gross sales price of approximately 1.0 million that were sold under the ATM Offering through June 30, 2024.

 Equity Securities Purchase Agreement 
 In connection with signing the Merger Agreement, we entered into the Equity SPA with GRI Operations and Altium pursuant to which Altium agreed to invest 12.3 million in cash and cancel any outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Bridge Notes in return for the issuance of shares of GRI Operations common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger for net proceeds of 11.7 million, after deducting offering expenses of 0.5 million. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 Our net losses were 6.3 million and 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.7 million in cash and an accumulated deficit of 37.8 million. We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our planned activities, particularly as we prepare for, initiate, and conduct our planned clinical trials of GRI-0621 and GRI-0803, advance our discovery programs and continue our product development efforts. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the middle of the first quarter of 2025. 
 Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We intend to raise capital through additional issuances of equity securities and/or short-term or long-term debt arrangements, but there can be no assurances any such financing will be available when needed, even if our research and development efforts are successful. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will need to reevaluate our operating plans and may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, or relinquish rights to our technology on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or cease operations entirely. These actions could materially impact our business, results of operations and future prospects and the value of shares of our Common Stock. In addition, attempting to secure additional financing may divert the time and attention of management from day-to-day activities and distract from our discovery and product development efforts. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize our current, or any future, product candidates. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. We have no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in our Annual Report. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not applicable to emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: 
 reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
 no non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
 exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this report and may continue to do so until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more, (b) December 31, 2026, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of Vallon s initial public offering, (c) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined above, are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
