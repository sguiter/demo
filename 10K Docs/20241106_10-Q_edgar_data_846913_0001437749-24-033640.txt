of excess capital in debt securities, or hold in money market funds until such investments can be made, with BMO Harris Bank N.A (BMO Harris). A portion of the funds invested are restricted as collateral under the Investment Collateral Security agreement (see Note 10 ). At September 30, 2024 , the amount of funds collateralized under the Investment Collateral Security agreement is relating to existing standby letters of credit that is comprised of with varying maturity dates that expire no later than September 30, 2025 and with the latest maturity date no later than June 30, 2026. 
 
 We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in money market funds. Carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the maturities of three months or less. 

Our investments in debt securities consist of United States (US) Treasury securities, including Notes, Bonds, and Bills, and US Government Agency securities, which are designated as held-to-maturity (HTM) and stated at amortized cost. The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity and does not expect to sell any debt securities before maturity to settle an obligation under the Investment Collateral Security agreement. The original maturities of our HTM investments range from three to thirty-six months. HTM debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. HTM debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. HTM debt investments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as long-term investments. Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in Interest income under the effective yield method. Accrued interest is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the creditworthiness of the entities issuing these securities, there is no impairment recorded related to the unrealized losses. 
 
 The following table provides the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of our HTM debt securities:

Usage is recorded in cost of sales in the period that parts were issued to a project, used to service equipment, or sold to customers. Equipment constructed for resale that is in process is recorded in Other assets. In process equipment for inventory recorded as Other assets was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. In ventories are periodically evaluated to identify obsolete or otherwise impaired parts and are written off when management determines usage is not probable. The Company estimates the balance of excess and obsolete inventory by analyzing inventory by age using last used and original purchase date and existing sales pipeline for which the inventory could be used.

Contract Balances 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In our Air Pollution Control (APC) technology segment, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. For the FUEL CHEM technology segment, deliveries made in the current period but billed in subsequent periods are also considered contract assets. These assets are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. At September 30, 2024 , December 31, 2023 , and December 31, 2022 , contract assets for APC technology projects were approximately , , and , respectively. There were no contract assets for the FUEL CHEM technology segment as of September 30, 2024 , December 31, 2023 , and December 31, 2022 . 
 
 The Company will periodically bill in advance of costs incurred before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These liabilities are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract liabilities were , , and at September 30, 2024 , December 31, 2023 , and December 31, 2022 , respectively, and are included in other accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 were not materially impacted by any other items other than amounts billed and revenue recognized as described previously. Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, which represented revenue from progress towards completion of our APC technology contracts. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had construction contracts in progress that were identified as a loss contract. 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 
 Remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of APC technology booked orders for which work has not been performed. As of September 30, 2024 , the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was . The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately of the remaining performance obligations over the next months with the remaining recognized thereafter.

 Diluted weighted-average shares 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Fuel Tech had weighted-average outstanding equity awards of and , respectively, and warrants of in both periods, which were antidilutive or represent out-of-the-money options for the purpose of the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Fuel Tech had incremental equity awards that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the inclusion of such would have been anti-dilutive due to a net loss in the period. These equity awards could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in future years. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , Fuel Tech had weighted-average outstanding equity awards of and , respectively, and warrants of 2,850,000 in both periods, which were antidilutive or represent out-of-the-money options for the purpose of the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , Fuel Tech had incremental equity awards of that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the inclusion of such would have been anti-dilutive due to a net loss in the period. These equity awards could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in future years. 

shares that may be issued or reserved for awards to participants under the Incentive Plans. As of September 30, 2024 , Fuel Tech had shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plans. 
 
 We did not record any excess tax benefits within income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Given the Company has a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, there were no excess tax benefits to record for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . In addition, we account for forfeitures of awards based on an estimate of the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the estimate when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition. 
 
 Stock-based compensation is included in selling, general, and administrative costs in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

After-tax effect of stock-based compensation 

Stock Options 
 
 Stock options granted to employees under the Incentive Plans have a -year life and they vest as follows: after the second anniversary of the award date, after the third anniversary, and the final after the fourth anniversary of the award date. Fuel Tech calculates stock compensation expense for employee option awards based on the grant date fair value of the award, less expected annual forfeitures, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the four -year service period of the award. Stock options granted to members of our board of directors vest immediately. Stock compensation for these awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized in expense immediately. 
 
 Fuel Tech uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options. The principal variable assumptions utilized in valuing options and the methodology for estimating such model inputs include: 1 risk-free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option; 2 expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of Fuel Tech s Common Stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option; and 3 expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations. 

Stock option activity for Fuel Tech s Incentive Plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows: 

Granted 
 Exercised 
 Expired or forfeited 
 Outstanding on September 30, 2024 
 Exercisable on September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024 , there was unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the Incentive Plans. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 RSUs granted to employees vest over time based on continued service (typically vesting over a period between two to four ye ars), and RSUs granted to directors vest after a one year vesting period based on continued service. Su ch time-vested RSUs are valued at the date of grant based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the grant date. Compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service perio d. 
 
 In addition to the time vested RSUs, the Company entered into an Executive Performance RSU Award Agreement (the Agreement with certain officers, including its President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Sales (each a 2024 Participating Executive pursuant to which each 2024 Participating Executive will have the opportunity to earn a specified amount of restricted stock units (RSUs) based on Fuel Tech s performance in 2024. The target amount of RSUs for each of four possible RSU award components is set for each Participating Executive for 2024. The amount of actual RSU awards to be issued is contingent on performance by the Participating Executive and the Company in the performance areas and for the measurement periods set forth in the Agreement as determined by the Company. 
 
 The Agreement provides for four possible RSU awards: Look-Back RSUs, Total Revenue RSUs, New Business Growth RSUs, and Operating Income Growth RSUs. If the Look-Back RSU s are awarded, these RSUs will follow a vesting schedule that provides for vesting of one - third of the granted Look-Back RSUs after the first anniversary of the grant determination date, one - third after the second anniversary date and one - third after the third anniversary date. If the Total Revenue RSUs, New Business Growth RSUs, or Operating Income Growth RSUs targets are achieved, these RSU s will follow a vesting schedule whereby of the granted RSUs will vest one year following the grant determination date. All RSUs are valued at the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , there is of unrecognized compensation cost related to all non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of yea rs. 
 
 A summary of restricted stock unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: 

Granted 
 Vested 1.14 
 Forfeited 
 Unvested restricted stock units at September 30, 2024 

The fair value of restricted stock that vested during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 was . 
 
 Deferred Directors Fees 
 
 In addition to the Incentive Plans, Fuel Tech has a Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (Deferred Plan). Under the terms of the Deferred Plan, Directors can elect to defer Directors fees for shares of Fuel Tech Common Stock that are issuable at a future date as defined in the agreement. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Fuel Tech accounts for these awards as equity awards as opposed to liability awards. During the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , Fuel Tech recorded stock-based compensation expense under the Deferred Plan.

Total other accrued liabilities 

From time to time we are involved in litigation with respect to matters arising from the ordinary conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information, either adequate provision for anticipated costs have been accrued or the ultimate anticipated costs will not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We do not believe we have any pending loss contingencies that are probable or reasonably possible of having a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Fuel Tech issues a standard product warranty with the sale of its products to customers. Our recognition of warranty liability is based primarily on analyses of warranty claims experienced in the preceding years as the nature of our historical product sales for which we offer a warranty are substantially unchanged. This approach provides an aggregate warranty accrual that is historically aligned with actual warranty claims experienced. 
 
 There was no change in the warranty liability balance included in the other accrued liabilities line of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The warranty liability balance was at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

and for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company's effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to a full valuation allowance recorded on our United States, China and Italy deferred tax assets since we cannot anticipate when or if we will have sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets in the future. Further, our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate due to state taxes, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates, foreign losses incurred with no related tax benefit, non-deductible commissions, and non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 Fuel Tech had unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 

FUEL TECH, INC. 
 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to successfully execute on APC segment projects despite customer driven delays in project execution. The Company continued to see improved performance in the FUEL CHEM segment. We continue to invest in development of new technologies to expand our product offerings into the water and waste-water treatment market. Our capital resources are sufficient for our immediate and longer-term needs, and we continue to enjoy the services and support of a dedicated workforce. We expect that our cost control efforts will maintain our existing levels of operating expenditures and that new business opportunities will lead to an improved market outlook. 
 
 Key Operating Factors 
 
 Our FUEL CHEM segment experienced an increase in revenue and segment operating profits in the current quarter as compared to 2023. The FUEL CHEM segment was positively impac ted by dispatch related increases in operational demand from our client base and to the addition of new business in the current quarter as compared to 2023. 
 
 Our Air Pollution Control (APC) business experienced a decrease in revenue in the current quarter as compared to 2023, primarily due to customer driven delays in project execution. We are encouraged by the depth of our business development activities, which reflects an increased focus on global emissions protocols across a variety of fuel sources. We continue to experience a challenging operational environment resulting from customers delaying the timing of purchasing decisions. Our Consolidated APC backlog at September 30, 2024 was 6,444 and our global sales pipeline is in the 50 -75 million range. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the three-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7,851 and 7,988 , respectively, representing a decrease of 137 , or 2 , versus the same period last year. Revenues for the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19,850 and 20,736 , respectively, representing a decrease of 886 , or 4 , versus the same period last year. 
 
 The APC technology segment generated revenues of 3,224 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , representing a decrease of 487 , or 13 , from the prior year amount of 3,711 . The APC technology segment generated revenues of 9,491 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , representing a decrease of 1,201 , or 11 , from the prior year amount of 10,692 . This decrease in APC revenue was primarily related to timing of project execution on existing contracts. Consolidated APC backlog at September 30, 2024 was 6,444 versus backlog at December 31, 2023 of 7,458 . Our current backlog consists of U.S. domestic delivered projects totaling 1,142 and international delivered projects totaling 5,302 . 
 
 The FUEL CHEM technology segment generated revenues of 4,627 and 4,277 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, representing an increase of 350 , or 8 . The FUEL CHEM technology segment generated revenues of 10,359 and 10,044 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, representing an increase of 315 , or 3 . This increase in FUEL CHEM revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to outage completions and increased dispatch. 
 
 Cost of sales and gross margin 
 
 Consolidated gross margin percentage for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 43 and 45 , respectively . For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the FUEL CHEM operating segment gross margins remained steady at 49 . APC segment gross margin decreased to 35 from 40 primarily due to product and project mix. 
 
 Consolidated gross margin percentage for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 42 and 41 , respectively. Gross margin increased versus the comparable period in 2023 due to an increase in the APC operating segment gross margin partially offset by a decrease in FUEL CHEM operating segment gross margin. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the FUEL CHEM operating segment gross margins decreased to 47 from 49 primarily as a result of prior period reduced revenue performance and start-up costs attributed to a new account. APC segment gross margin increased to 38 from 33 primarily due to product and project mix. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) were 3,225 and 2,966 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the increase of 259 is primarily the result of increases in employee compensation and benefit related costs of 163, professional and service fees of 120, and travel costs of 26, partially offset by decreases in international administrative expenses of 19, depreciation expense of 17, and insurance costs of 14. For the three-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 , SG A as a percentage of revenues increased to 41 from 37 . The increase versus the comparable period is primarily due to the increase in expenses compared to prior quarter.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) were 9,815 and 9,126 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the increase of 689 is primarily the result of increases in employee compensation and benefit related costs of 488, professional and service fees of 147, travel costs of 42, and space rental costs of 38, partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs of 27. For the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 , SG A as a percentage of revenues increased to 49 from 44 . The increase versus the comparable period is primarily due to the increase in expenses compared to the prior year. 
 
 Research and development 
 
 Research and development expenses were 361 and 1,159 respectively for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 , and for the same periods in 2023 were 513 and 1,144, respectively. The expenditures in our research and development expenses are focused on new product development efforts in the pursuit of commercial applications for technologies outside of our traditional markets, and in the development and analysis of new technologies that could represent incremental market opportunities. This includes water treatment technologies and more specifically, our DGI Dissolved Gas Infusion Systems, an innovative alternative to current aeration technology. This infusion process has a variety of applications in the water and wastewater industries, including remediation, treatment, biological activity, and wastewater odor management. DGI technology benefits include reduced energy consumption, installation costs, and operating costs, while improving treatment performance. 
 
 Interest income 
 
 Interest income was 323 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 322 for the same period in 2023 . Interest income was 968 for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . Interest income primarily relates to interest received on the held-to-maturity debt securities and money market funds. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other expense, net was 63 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to Other income, net of 9 for the same period in 2023 . Other income, net was 1,576 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to Other expense, net of 95 for the same period in 2023 . Other income in 2024 primarily relates to the employee retention credit of 1,677 recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Other expense in 2023 was mainly due to transactional foreign exchange losses. 

Liquidity and Sources of Capital 
 
 We have losses from operations during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 totaling 2,586 . Our cash used in operations for this same period totaled 1,785 . 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalent balance as of September 30, 2024 totaled 12,274 , which includes 2,452 of cash equivalents, and our working capital totaled 25,602 . We have no outstanding debt other than our outstanding letters of credit, under our Investment Collateral Security agreement with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. (the Investment Collateral Security agreement), which does not have any financial covenants. We expect to continue operating under this arrangement for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Operating activities used cash of 1,785 for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 2,522 (including the impact of 1,677 for the employee retention credit receivable) and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1,215, offset by an increase in accounts payable of 842, a decrease in prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other non-current assets of 655, and removals of non-cash items from our net income from continuing operations of stock-based compensation of 337, depreciation and amortization of 290, and interest income on held-to-maturity securities of 108. 
 
 Operating activities provided cash of 391 for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to an increase in other liabilities of 520 due to timing of project related activity, a decrease in other current assets of 363, an increase in accounts payable of 172 due to timing of project related activity, and removals of non-cash items from our net loss from continuing operations for depreciation and amortization of 293 and stock-based compensation of 288. 
 
 Investing activities used cash of 3,388 and 10,227 for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Investing activities for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily consisted of purchases of debt securities as investments of 14,072 and 14,026, respectively. Investing activities for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were funded by the maturities of debt securities of 11,000 and 4,000, respectively. 
 
 Financing activities used cash of 95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to taxes paid on behalf of the equity award participants on the vesting of restricted stock units. Financing activities provided cash of 42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 
 We continue to monitor our liquidity needs and in response to our recent periods of declines in revenue and net losses have taken measures to reduce expenses and restructure operations which we feel are necessary to ensure we maintain sufficient working capital and liquidity to operate the business and invest in our future. We have evaluated our ongoing business needs and considered the cash requirements of our base business of Air Pollution Control and FUEL CHEM. This evaluation included consideration of the following: a) customer and revenue trends in our APC and FUEL CHEM business segments, b) current operating structure and expenditure levels, and c) other research and development initiatives. Based on this analysis, management believes that currently we have sufficient cash and working capital to operate our base APC and FUEL CHEM businesses. We believe our current cash position and net cash flows expected to be generated from operations are adequate to fund planned operations of the Company for the next 12 months.

We expect additional capital expenditures in 2024 for the DGI business, maintenance of field equipment, computer and systems, and general office equipment. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash from operations or cash on hand. 
 
 In 2022, the Board of Directors approved an investment plan that would hold 20,000 in funds at BMO Harris Bank (BMO Harris) to be invested in held-to-maturity debt securities of United States (US) Treasuries, including Notes, Bonds, and Bills, or US Government Agency securities. The funds are held in money market funds until they are invested in those securities. The investments are structured to create a maturity ladder where the proceeds from maturities are re-invested to maintain a balance of short- and long-term investments based on expected business needs. Maturities are between three and thirty-six months. This strategy allows the Company to provide returns on excess cash, while managing liquidity and minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
 
 On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into the Investment Collateral Security agreement to use for the sole purpose of issuing standby letters of credit, which replaces the Cash Collateral Security agreement with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. (the Former Collateral agreement). The Investment Collateral Security agreement requires us to pledge our investments as collateral for 150 of the aggregate face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit. The Company pays 250 basis points on the face values of outstanding letters of credit. There are no financial covenants set forth in the Investment Collateral Security agreement. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had outstanding standby letters of credit totaling approximately 1,722 under the Investment Collateral Security agreement. At September 30, 2024 , the investments held as collateral totaled 2,584 . Fuel Tech is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these instruments. 
 
 Contingencies and Contractual Obligations 
 
 Fuel Tech issues a standard product warranty with the sale of its products to customers as discussed in Note 13. There was no change in the warranty liability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
