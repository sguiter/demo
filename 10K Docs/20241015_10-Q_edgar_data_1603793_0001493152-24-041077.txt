and for the fiscal year ended February 29,
2024, and the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, respectively. During the six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company incurred
cash losses of approximately from its operating activities. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of approximately
 and negative working capital of approximately . 

The
Company s principal capital and exploration expenditures during next fiscal year are expected to relate to selected well workovers
on its Jack and Palo Pinto County acreages. The Company believes that it has sufficient cash on hand and available funds from its credit
line to fund its costs for such expenditures as well as other operating costs, for the 12-month period subsequent to issuance of these
consolidated financial statements with available borrowings under its line of credit with a related party of . 

In
the event that the Company requires additional capital to fund higher operational losses or oil and gas property lease purchases for
the next 12 months, the Company expects to seek additional capital from one or more sources via restricted private placement sales of
equity and debt securities from those other than JBB. However, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to secure the
necessary capital to fund its costs on acceptable terms, or at all. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to fund its operations,
it would have to undertake other aggressive cost cutting measures and then be subject to possible loss of some of its rights and interests
in prospects to curtail operations and forced to forego opportunities or in worst case, cease operations.

Overview 

Norris
Industries, Inc. (the Company , we , or us is an oil and natural gas company that focuses on
the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. As of March 1, 2024 the SEC Non-Escalated
Analysis of Estimated Proved Reserve of our various leases in Jack County and Palo-Pinto County, the Ratliff leases, the Marshall-Walden,
and the Bend Arch Lion 1A and Bend Arch Lion 1B leaseholds, is a total of 29 Mbbl in oil net reserves, plus 150 MMcf in natural gas net
reserves being out of total of BOE equivalent of 54 Mbbl in gross reserves, which is down from prior year by 322 Mbbl due to reduction
of expected production as result of well workover issues. 

For
near- to medium-term cash flow enhancement, the Company will plan to focus on existing fields and to selectively consider larger-reserve
oil and gas properties with low production to acquire at reasonable cost and then implement effective Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR methods to improve its current revenues and assets. For long-term cash flow enhancement, the Company plans to identify other oil-field
related, and niche enterprises to consider for bolt on, or diversified acquisition targets to grow Company revenues. This may be with
use of capital, or debt sources from existing owners to fund buyout targets via the Company s strategic joint venture partnerships,
and, or to raise outside capital to fund any potential future acquisition. 

The
Company s long-term objective is to increase shareholder value by growing reserves, production, and cash flow. As result we may
seek to identify and consider acquisition opportunities of oilfield services companies and other non-oilfield companies that align with
our operational plan to implement a diversified growth strategy. 

Notwithstanding
the above stated objectives, the ramifications of the prior pandemic containment measures and consequent disruptions to the United States
and world economies due to the COVID 19 viral outbreaks had an adverse impact on the overall business of the Company and the
industry in which it operates. The demand for oil and gas has impacted all producers as commodity prices of oil and gas has increased
substantially, but so has inflation resulting in higher costs for materials, equipment, personnel and service providers which the US
Federal Reserve has taken lead to increase interest rates substantially from prior low levels that has tightened financial conditions.
In addition, in early 2022 the industry faced added complications as result of the Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine and also with
the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023, and the war response from Israeli forces on Gaza has created further instability
in the Middle East. As result energy prices have risen; however, we are unable to predict exact supply and demand balances that will
cause energy prices to be highly volatile and thus affect our revenues into the near future. Therefore, we anticipate that we may not
be able to cover operating costs and will have to take cost-cutting measures and seek continued operational financing. 

3 

As
a result of the prior COVID-19 pandemic and wars in Ukraine, Middle East conflicts and the various governmental and political responses
and those of our subcontractors, customers and suppliers, we expect continued delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations
due to shortages of labor and increased cost from suppliers. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations have been
and are likely to continue to be adversely affected. Thus, subject to adjustments due the general economic consequences and the more
specific impact on the oil and gas industry, the current general strategic objectives of the Company are set forth below. 

Our
Business Strategy 

We
are a small Exploration and Production E P oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development,
and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. The Company is currently managed by business and oil and gas exploration
veterans who specialize in the oil and gas acquisition and exploration markets of the Central West Texas region. The Company s
goal is to tap into the high potential leases of the Central West Texas region of the United States, aiming to unlock its potential,
specifically in the prolific Bend Arch-Fort Worth region. This area is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles wide running from Archer
County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in the south. The Company is also looking at other acquisition opportunities in the
Permian Basin, West Texas, East Texas and South Texas region. 

Management
believes that focusing on the development of existing small producing fields is one of the key differentiators of the Company. Oil and
natural gas reserve development is a technologically oriented industry. Management believes that the use of current generally available
technology has greatly increased the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success means the
ability to make an oil/gas well that produces a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbons. 

We
plan to execute the following business strategies: 

Develop
and Grow Our Hydrocarbon Resource Acreage Positions Using Outside Development Expertise . We plan to continue to seek and acquire
niche assets in hydrocarbon-rich resource plays to improve our asset quality and expand our drilling inventory. We plan to leverage our
management team s expertise and apply the latest available EOR technologies to economically develop our existing property portfolio
in Central West and East Texas in addition to any assets in other regions we may acquire. We operate the majority of our acreage, thus
giving us certain control over the planning of capital expenditures, execution and cost reduction. Our operational plan allows us to
adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. As a small producer, we regionally evaluate industry
drilling results to implement simple yet effective operating practices which may increase our initial production rates, ultimate recovery
factors and rate of return on invested capital. 

The
Company s long-term objective is to increase shareholder value by growing reserves, production, and cash flow. As result we may
seek to identify and consider acquisition opportunities of oilfield services companies and other non-oilfield companies to implement
a diversified growth strategy. 

Our
management s time in the petroleum markets and our ability to contract experienced geology expertise, allows us to identify and
secure acreage with potential reserves. Management believes that the Company s near prospects as a public company could become
attractive as a potential merger candidate for acquisition of a private enterprise. 

Our
Competitive Strengths 

Management
believes that we have a number of competitive strengths that will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies: 

Simple
Capital Structure . We have a simple capital structure and de-risked inventory of quality locations with what we believe is upside
potential to take advantage of the current recovery of oil prices to acquire potential production at reasonable cost. Management believes
there are opportunities for profits to be made now that oil prices appear to have stabilized and if they continue to gradually rise higher. 

Moderate
Risk Exploration Practice . Unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high degree of risk, we focus
on shallow well exploration (sub 5,000 feet) that is less expensive and has lower risk factors. The basis for management s belief
that the wells that can be drilled in the prospective leases will have the capacity to produce a reasonable amount of hydrocarbon and
due to our recent studies of the general areas where we are prospecting the projects. That is our most important exploration practice. 

Under
The Radar Asset Base . Management believes our local West Texas E P team has a special talent in acquiring local prime
time hydrocarbon land leases with sub-300 barrels of oil per day bopd wells that have large hydrocarbon reserves.
Management believes that these under the radar prospective leases have multi-year drilling inventory and reasonable production
history with high upside potential and not readily accessible to the public for auctions, thus adding to our competitive advantage on
these under the radar opportunities. It is because management also believes that these highly valuable leases are not economically
justifiable for the major oil and gas companies in the region because such companies need the wells they drill to produce at least 300
barrels Bbls of oil per day per well. 

4 

Technologies 

Oil
and natural gas reserve development is a technologically oriented industry; many techniques developed by the industry are now used in
other industries, including the space program. Management believes that technological innovations have made it possible for the oil and
natural gas industry to furnish the fuels that power the world economy. Management also believes that technology has greatly increased
the success rate of finding commercial oil or natural gas deposits. In this context, success rate means the ability to make an oil/gas
well that can produce a commercialized quantity of hydrocarbon. 

At
NRIS, we focus on core basic field EOR management practices and contract outside experts to provide us the understanding of complex mineralogy
in shale reservoirs to better determine zones prone to fracture stimulation. This technology can suggest where to frack by providing
us with available data to deliver us a greater chance of success. Our field engineers, geologists and petrophysicists work together for
better drilling decisions. 

Sales
Strategy 

Our
sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price
is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we will aim to have our inventory be as low as possible, in some instances virtually
zero. Our E P core team has business relationships with BML, Transport Oil, and Lion Oil Trading Transportation, for oil sales
and WTG Jameson for gas sales. The Company entered into production agreements with BML, Lion Oil and WTG Jameson so that, as our tier
1 buyer, they can handle pick-up and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and gas via local gas pipelines. 

As
such, crude oil will be picked up from our leases as needed during the calendar month. At the end of the month the crude total sales
will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil will be tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following
month the proceeds checks will be issued to the financial parties of record. 

Operational
Plans 

Overall,
we seek to acquire on a selective basis, oil and gas reserve concessions with existing production. To maintain our operations and complete
any acquisitions we intend to raise capital via equity or debt, be this from our control owner, or other third-party financing sources,
including the capital markets. The Company is still in the process of assessing the wells it holds, or recently acquired and is reviewing
its options. 

As
result of COVID-19 Pandemic the Company took a pause on any acquisition activity in the past three years. If and when the Company does
review any acquisitions, it will follow model which is based on a concept that has been proven in the past to be an effective and successful
path of development for many other well- known E P players: 

a) The
 financed acquisition of mature smaller oil fields that have potential for instituting EOR
 incremental production processes; and 

b) Develop
 strategic partnerships with existing operators to share production increases garnered through
 the implementation of this EOR plan. 

The
Company has plans to limit its operating budget for current wells to basic maintenance and has not determined whether to spend for any
new drill programs in the near future but plans to review and consider other energy related business opportunities in the oilfield to
diversify and increase its sales revenues and income.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of August 31, 2024, the Company had cash on-hand of 71,739. 

Net
cash used in operating activities during the six months ended August 31, 2024, was 182,478, compared to cash used in operating activities
of 260,439 for the same period in 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for six months ended August 31, 2024, was 200,000, related to proceeds from the Company s
line of credit with JBB, compared to cash provided by financing activities of 200,000 for the same period in 2023, related to proceeds
from the Company s line of credit with JBB. 

The
Company will require additional financing to support its operations and to pursue its acquisition program. As of August 31, 2024, the
Company had availability of 400,000 on its existing credit line with JBB which has been extended to September 30, 2026. If the Company
requires additional financing beyond what is available under its existing credit line, it does not have any committed sources of financing
at this time. If it is unable to obtain financing, it will have to reduce or curtail its operations and acquisition program. There is
no assurance that it will be able to obtain financing in the future, and even if financing is available, it may not be on terms acceptable
to the Company. 

To
date, the funding during the past three fiscal years to support operations and facilitate some acquisitions has been provided by the
largest shareholder of the Company. This individual does not have any legal obligation to continue to provide funding to the Company.
Yet the majority owner has indicated a willingness, and provided some assurances, to selectively review and determine added funding for
certain low risk initiatives on those oil and gas wells in which the Company has either a 100 or a majority working interest in order
to increase its existing production. Our majority shareholder expects, but is not legally obligated, to provide funding for the Company s
capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2024. Such funding may be provided in the form of loans, issuance of equity or other means.

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company will either have to increase
its operating revenues to a point to be able to cover its operating expenses or obtain funding from other investors or lenders. There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its revenues or obtain funding. There is no assurance that the Company will
be able to continue its operations. In such instances, investors will suffer a loss in the value of their investment in the Company. 

On
September 6, 2023, the Company entered into another amendment of its Loan Note with JBB to increase the line of credit by an additional
 500,000, for a total of 4,300,000, and extend the maturity date for the original note and line of credit to September 30, 2025 which
has been further extended to September 30, 2026.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which in our case is the same individual.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August
31, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the Evaluation
Date, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
because of the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that were disclosed in Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures in our 2024 annual report on Form 10-K in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
