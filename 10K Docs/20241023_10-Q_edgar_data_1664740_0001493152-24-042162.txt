of interest on the mortgages it holds and uses those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of the Notes (the Noteholders and certain operating expenses. 

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. 

Interest
income from mortgage loans held by the Company is recognized, as earned, over the loan period. Costs incurred in connection with the
issuance of the senior secured notes are being amortized over ten years, using the straight-line method, as the difference between use
of the effective interest method is not material.

Notes in the IPO in the aggregate principal amount of under the Indenture, dated April 25, 2016, among the Company, as Issuer,
MBC, as Guarantor, and Worldwide Stock Transfer LLC Worldwide ), as Indenture Trustee (the Indenture ). The
Notes are listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol LOAN/26 . Interest accrues on the Notes commencing on May
16, 2016. The accrued interest is payable monthly in cash, in arrears, on the 15th day of each calendar month commencing June 2016. 

. 

The
Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time after April 22, 2019 upon at least 30 days prior written notice to the
Noteholders. The redemption price will be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the accrued but unpaid
interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption, without penalty or premium. No Notes were redeemed by the Company
as of September 30, 2024. 

Each
Noteholder had the right to cause the Company to redeem his, her or its Notes on April 22, 2021 by notifying the Company in writing,
no earlier than November 22, 2020 and no later than January 22, 2021. No Noteholder exercised such right during the required time frame
and as such the Notes are no longer redeemable by the Noteholders. 

The
Company is obligated to offer to redeem the Notes if there occurs a change of control with respect to the Company or MBC
or if the Company or MBC sell any assets unless, in the case of an asset sale, the proceeds are reinvested in the business of the seller.
The redemption price in connection with a change of control will be of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed
plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption price in connection with an
asset sale will be the outstanding principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including,
the date of redemption.

Item
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ
significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements . 

We
are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation MBC ), and were formed in December
2015 specifically for the purpose of the initial public offering IPO of the Notes (described below). On April 25, 2016,
we sold 6,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 6 Senior Secured Notes, due April 22, 2026 (the Notes ), in our IPO
for net proceeds of 5,200,000, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Notes are
secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets, including, primarily, mortgage notes, mortgages and other transaction documents
entered into in connection with first mortgage loans originated and funded by MBC, which we acquired from MBC pursuant to an asset purchase
agreement. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture ), the aggregate outstanding principal balance
of the mortgage loans held by us, together with our cash on hand, must always equal at least 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Notes at all times until the Notes are paid in full. In addition, MBC has guaranteed our obligations under the Notes and
has secured that guaranty with a pledge of all of our outstanding common shares. 

The
Notes are listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol LOAN/26 . 

To
the extent any of the mortgages acquired from MBC are satisfied in full, such mortgages will be replaced with one or more mortgages with
similar aggregate principal amount. At September 30, 2024, the pool of mortgage loans was comprised of 17 loans with an aggregate outstanding
principal balance of 8,264,250. 

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO on April 25, 2016, we did not have any material operations. As of April 2016, we collect payments of interest
on the mortgages we hold and use those funds to make the required interest payments to the holders of the Notes and certain operating
expenses. Any excess cash will be distributed to MBC or held by us to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Results
of Operations 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Total
Revenue 

Total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 229,000 and 227,000, respectively, represent interest
income on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 109,000
are attributable to the issuance of the Notes. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 4,000 are comprised of fees
paid to the Indenture trustee and NYSE American LLC, as well as bank fees.

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Total
Revenue 

Total
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 693,000 and 659,000, respectively, represent interest
income on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher interest
rates charged on such loans due to market conditions at the time the loans were originated or extended. 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs 

Interest
and amortization of deferred financing costs for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 326,000
are attributable to the issuance of the Notes. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 12,000 are comprised of fees
paid to the Indenture trustee and NYSE American LLC, as well as bank fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 48,000 compared to cash of approximately 40,000 at December 31, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 406,000, compared to approximately
 368,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities mainly resulted from
the increase in revenue. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted
from our interest income and amortization of deferred financing costs. 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 399,000, compared to approximately
 365,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from
the increase in net income. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflected advances
of excess cash to MBC for working capital and general corporate purposes. Amounts advanced to MBC are non-interest bearing and due on
demand. 

We
had no cash provided by or used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

Under
the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by the Company, together with the
Company s cash on hand, must always equal at least 120 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times. 

We
anticipate that our current cash balances together with our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for
the next 12 months.
