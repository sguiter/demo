 To estimate expected credit losses for corporate debt securities, held to maturity, the Company's projected cash flows are primarily driven by assumptions regarding the severity of loss, which is a function of the probability of default and projected recovery rates. The Company's default and recovery rates are based on credit ratings, credit analysis and macroeconomic forecasts. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the Company's corporate debt, held to m aturity was . 
 Contractual Maturities 
 Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. ABS classified as held to maturity had a carrying value of million (2023: million). 
 Corpo rate debt classified as held to maturity with a net carrying value of million (2023: is due between 1 year and 3 years and corporate debt classified as held to maturity with a net carrying value of million (2023: million) is due between 3 years and 10 years.

 Allowance for expected credit losses ) ) ) Total mortgage loans, held for investment 
 
 The primary credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans are the debt service coverage ratio which compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan, (generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss) and the loan-to-value ratio which compares the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral (generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss). The debt service coverage ratio and loan-to-value ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating these ratios, are updated quarterly. 
 
 The Company has a high quality commercial mortgage loan portfolio with a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of x (2023: x) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of (2023: ). At September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were no past due amounts associated with the commercial mortgage loans held by the Company.

 (2023: of the total mortgage loan portfolio, is evaluated for credit losses based on inputs unique to this sector. This assessment utilizes historical credit loss experience adjusted to reflect current conditions and management forecasts. Further, collateral dependent commercial mortgage loans (e.g., when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is reasonably possible or probable) are evaluated individually for credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses for a collateral dependent loan is established as the excess of amortized cost over the estimated fair value of the loan's underlying collateral, less selling cost when foreclosure is probable. 
 
 Accordingly, any change in estimated credit losses are recognized as a change in the allowance for expected credit losses which is recorded in net investment gains (losses). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company's mortgage loan portfolio had an allowance for expected credit loss of million (2023: million).

 Other Investments - CLO-Equities 
 
 The CLO-Equities market continues to be relatively inactive with only a small number of transactions being observed, particularly related to transactions involving CLO-Equities held by the Company. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company's indirect investment in CLO-Equities is determined using a discounted cash flow model prepared by an external investment manager. 
 
 The default and loss severity rates are the most judgmental unobservable market inputs to the discounted cash flow model to which the valuation of the Company's indirect investment in CLO-Equities is most sensitive. A significant increase (decrease) in either of these significant inputs in isolation would result in a lower (higher) fair value estimate for the investment in CLO-Equities and, in general, a change in default rate assumptions would be accompanied by a directionally similar change in loss severity rate assumptions. Collateral spreads and estimated maturity dates are less judgmental inputs as they are based on the historical average of actual spreads and the weighted average life of the current underlying portfolios, respectively. A significant increase (decrease) in either of these significant inputs in isolation would result in a higher (lower) fair value estimate for the investment in CLO-Equities. In general, these inputs have no significant interrelationship with each other or with default and loss severity rates. 
 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company's valuation process for its indirect investment in CLO-Equities includes a review of the underlying cash flows and key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model. The above significant unobservable inputs are reviewed and updated based on information obtained from secondary markets, including information received from the managers of the Company's CLO-Equities investment. In order to assess the reasonableness of the inputs the Company uses in the discounted cash flow model, the Company maintains an understanding of current market conditions, historical results, and emerging trends that may impact future cash flows. In addition, the assumptions the Company uses in its models are updated through regular communication with industry participants and o ngoing monitoring of the deals in which the Company participates. 
 
 Other Investments - Other Privately Held Securities 
 
 Other privately held securities are initially valued at cost which approximates fair value. In subsequent measurement periods, the fair value of the variable yield security was determined using an externally developed discounted cash flow model. This model includes inputs that are specific to that investment. The inputs used in the fair value measurement include an appropriate discount rate, default rate, loss absorption rate and estimated maturity date. The selection of an appropriate discount rate is judgmental and is the most significant unobservable input used in the valuation of this investment. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation could result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement for this investment. In order to assess the reasonableness of the inputs the Company uses in the discounted cash flow model, the Company maintains an understanding of current market conditions, historical results, as well as investee specific information that may impact future cash flows.

 million (2023: million) and a fair value of million (2023: million). The fair values of these securities are determined using a model which uses prepayment speeds and spreads sourced primarily from the new issue market. As the significant inputs used to price these securities are observable market inputs, their fair values are classified as Level 2. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of mortgage loans, held for investment, approximated fair value. The fair values of mortgage loans are primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows and discounting them using current interest rates for similar mortgage loans with similar credit risk or are determined from pricing for similar loans. As mortgage loans are not actively traded, their fair values are classified as Level 3. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company's debt was recorded at amortized cost with a carrying value of million (2023: million) and a fair value of million (2023: million). The fair value of the Company's debt is based on prices obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. These spreads are generally obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading and broker-dealer quotes. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads are observable market inputs, the fair value of this debt is classified as Level 2. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Federal Home Loan Bank advances were recorded at amortized cost with a carrying value of million (2023: million) and a fair value of million (2023: million). As these advances are not actively traded, their fair values are classified as Level 2.

 Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The Company's derivative instruments are generally traded under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements which establish terms that apply to all transactions. In the event of a bankruptcy or other stipulated event, master netting agreements provide that individual positions be replaced with a new amount, usually referred to as the termination amount, determined by taking into account market prices and converting into a single currency. Effectively, this contractual close-out netting reduces credit exposure from gross to net exposure.

 Estimates for Significant Catastrophe Events 
 
 At September 30, 2024, net reserves for losses and loss expenses included estimated amounts for numerous catastrophe events. The magnitude and complexity of losses arising from certain of these events inherently increase the level of uncertainty and, therefore, the level of management judgment involved in arriving at estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses. These events include Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Ian, Winter Storm Elliot, June European Convective Storms, the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ materially from current estimates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized catastrophe and weather-related losses, net of reinsurance, of million (2023: million).

OVERVIEW 

Business Overview 
 AXIS Capital, through its operating subsidiaries, is a global specialty underwriter and provider of insurance and reinsurance solutions with operations in Bermuda, the U.S., Europe, Singapore and Canada. Our underwriting operations are organized around our global underwriting platforms, AXIS Insurance and AXIS Re. 
 We provide our clients and distribution partners with a broad range of risk transfer products and services, and strong capacity, backed by excellent financial strength. We manage our portfolio holistically, aiming to construct the optimum portfolio of risks, consistent with our risk appetite and the development of our franchise. We nurture an ethical, entrepreneurial, disciplined and diverse culture that promotes outstanding client service, intelligent risk taking, operating efficiency, corporate citizenship and the achievement of superior risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We believe that the achievement of our objectives will position us as a global leader in specialty risks. The execution of our business strategy for the first nine months of 2024 included the following: 
 growing in a number of attractive specialty insurance and reinsurance markets including U.S. excess and surplus lines and Lloyd's specialty insurance business; 
 
 re-balancing our portfolio towards less volatile lines of business, that carry attractive returns while deploying capital within risk limit tolerance, diversification criteria and risk management strategy; 
 
 investing in attractive growth markets and advancing capabilities to address more transactional specialist business targeting the lower middle market with our key distribution partners; 
 
 leveraging our global platform to introduce our products and services to new regions including the expansion of our London specialty lines to North America markets; 
 
 continuing the implementation of a more focused distribution strategy while building mutually beneficial relationships with clients and partners;

Outlook 
 
 We are committed to advancing AXIS as a specialty underwriting leader that delivers consistent, profitable growth. We believe our market positioning, diversified book of business, specialty underwriting acumen, global platform, claims management capabilities, and deep distribution relationships, supported by a conservative and well performing investment portfolio, provides opportunity for continued and increased profitability. 
 
 Overall, the current property and casualty market trends continue to be favorable for specialty insurance and reinsurance carriers. We anticipate market rate change to continue to exceed loss cost trends across the casualty classes but do expect to experience moderate rate erosion in the first party as well as financial lines sectors. Following multiple years of rate increases outpacing loss cost trends across the specialty sector, pricing has moderated in these distinct areas due to the emergence of new capital creating an increase in available capacity. We will continue to lean into sectors, and sub sectors, where premium adequacy metrics remain strong and where we see market dislocations creating opportunity for additional profitable growth. 
 
 The wholesale channel continues to experience growth due to market dislocations in the admitted market. We anticipate this continuing throughout 2024 with market opportunities arising predominantly in Specialty and Excess and Surplus lines. We continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities by employing a disciplined underwriting appetite and strategy. 
 Pricing momentum in non-proportional reinsurance continues to be strong while our proportional reinsurance business is benefiting from rate increases in the underlying business. We expect these market conditions to persist in the near term. We continue to focus on underwriting discipline to drive targeted profitable growth among the specialty and casualty reinsurance lines that we offer. 
 
 Across the business, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities by employing a disciplined underwriting strategy and appetite. Where prices continue to deliver adequate profitability, we will look to grow within our risk and volatility guidelines. With a strengthened book of business, and an expanding footprint in specialty markets experiencing favorable conditions, we believe AXIS is well positioned to drive profitable growth within the current environment.

 Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 
 
 On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (the "Act") which will apply a corporate income tax of 15 for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Act includes a provision referred to as the economic transition adjustment, which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the tax regime. Pursuant to the Act and subsequently issued guidance, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of 163 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, which we expect to utilize mainly over a 10-year period. We expect to incur increased taxes in Bermuda beginning in 2025. The Bermuda net deferred tax benefit is excluded from operating income (loss).

 The decrease in liability lines also reflected the decrease in gross premiums written in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the restructuring of a significant quota share retrocession treaty with a strategic capital partner. 
 
 The decrease in credit and surety lines was partially offset by the increase in gross premiums written in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in marine and aviation lines was associated with the non-renewal of an aviation non-proportional retrocession treaty following the exit from this line of business in January 2023.

Ceded premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 776 million, or 37 , of gross premiums written, compared to 774 million, or 39 , of gross premiums written for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in ceded premiums written of 2 million, or 0.3 , was primarily driven by increases in credit and surety, agriculture, and accident and health lines, largely offset by decreases in liability, professional lines and catastrophe lines. 
 
 The increase in credit and surety lines was due to the increase in gross premiums written in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the restructuring of a significant quota share retrocession treaty with a strategic capital partner, partially offset by the non-renewal of a significant quota share retrocession treaty. 
 
 The increase in agriculture lines was related to premiums ceded to a new whole account quota share retrocessional treaty. 
 
 The increase in accident and health lines was due to the increase in gross premiums written in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in liability lines was attributable to the restructuring of two significant quota share retrocession treaties with strategic capital partners. The decrease in liability lines also reflected the decrease in gross premiums written in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in professional lines was driven by the restructuring of a significant quota share retrocession treaty with a strategic capital partner.

 Current Accident Year Loss Ratio 
 
 The current accident year loss rat io increased to 68.0 fo r the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 67.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The current accident year loss ratio for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was impacted by a higher level of catastrophe and weather-related losses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, catastrophe and weather-related losses, were 7 million, or 2.0 points, primarily attributable to weather-related events. Comparatively, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, catastrophe and weather-related losses, were 5 million, or 1.0 point, primarily attributable to weather-related events. 
 
 Adjusting for the impact of the catastrophe and weather-related losses, the current accident year loss ratio of 66.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was comparable to 66.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 principally due to the impact of a loss expense related to the retrocession agreement entered into with Monarch Point Re reflected in the prior year, largely offset by changes in business mix attributable to the exit from catastrophe and property lines of business which are associated with relatively lower loss ratios. 
 
 The current accident year loss rat io of 66.9 fo r the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was comparable to the current accident year loss ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 66.7 . 
 
 The current accident year loss ratio for nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was impacted by a lower level of catastrophe and weather-related losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, catastrophe and weather-related losses, were 9 million, or 0.9 points, attributable to weather-related events. Comparatively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, catastrophe and weather-related losses, were 24 million, or 1.8 points, primarily attributable to Cyclone Gabrielle, and other weather-related events.

Adjusting for the impact of the catastrophe and weather-related losses, the current accident year loss ratio increased to 66.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 64.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was principally due to elevated loss experience in marine and aviation, and engineering lines, partially offset by the impact of the loss expense related to the retrocession agreement entered into with Monarch Point Re reflected in the prior year. 
 
 Prior Year Reserve Development 
 
 Refer to Item 1, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 'Reserve for losses and loss expenses' for details on prior year reserve development by the lines of business. 
 
 Acquisition Cost Ratio 
 
 The acquisition cost ratio decreased to 20.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to adjustments attributable to loss-sensitive features in accident and health lines, and a decrease in costs associated with changes in business mix within accident and health lines, partially offset by adjustments attributable to loss-sensitive features driven by improved loss performance related to mortgage business in credit and surety lines, and an increase in costs associated with changes in business mix within agriculture lines. 
 
 The acquisition cost ratio increased to 22.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to adjustments attributable to loss-sensitive features driven by improved loss performance in motor lines in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by the impact of changes in business mix on retrocessional contracts driven by increases in credit and surety, and accident and health business written in recent periods, together with a decrease in catastrophe business written in recent periods. 
 
 Underwriting-Related General and Administrative Expense Ratio 
 
 The underwriting-related general and administrative expense decreased to 3.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by an increase in fees related to arrangements with strategic capital partners to 13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned. 
 
 The underwriting-related general and administrative expense decreased to 3.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by an increase in fees related to arrangements with strategic capital partners to 40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease in information technology costs.

 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) primarily results from income (loss) in our foreign operations in the U.S., U.K., and Europe. Our effective tax rate which is calculated as income tax expense (benefit) divided by income (loss) before tax including interest in income (loss) of equity method investments was 21.0 and (4.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 11.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This effective rate can vary between periods depending on the distribution of net income (loss) among tax jurisdictions, as well as other factors. 
 
 The income tax expense of 48 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to pre-tax income in our U.S. and U.K. operations.

FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We believe the following financial indicators are important in evaluating performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for common shareholders: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Annualized return on average common equity (1) 
 13.0 16.1 19.9 15.4 Annualized operating return on average common equity (2) 
 17.3 18.0 18.2 18.4 Book value per diluted common share (3) 
 64.65 51.17 64.65 51.17 Cash dividends declared per common share 0.44 0.44 1.32 1.32 Increase (decrease) in book value per diluted common share adjusted for dividends 5.80 0.63 11.91 5.54 
 (1) Annualized return on average common equity ("ROACE") is calculated by dividing annualized net income (loss) available (attributable) to common shareholders for the period by the average common shareholders' equity determined using the common shareholders' equity balances at the beginning and end of the period. 
 (2) Annualized operating return on average common equity ("operating ROACE") is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Item 10(e) of SEC Regulation S-K. The reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, annualized ROACE, and a discussion of the rationale for its presentation is provided in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation '. 
 (3) Book value per diluted common share represents total common shareholders equity divided by the number of diluted common share outstanding, determined using the treasury stock method. 
 
 Return on Average Common Equity 
 
 Our objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward common shareholders for the risks we assume and to grow revenue only when we expect the returns will meet or exceed our requirements. We recognize that the nature of underwriting cycles and the frequency or severity of large loss events in any one year may challenge the ability to achieve a profitability target in any specific period. 
 
 ROACE reflects the impact of net income (loss) available (attributable) to common shareholders, including net investment gains (losses), foreign exchange losses (gains), reorganization expenses, interest in income (loss) of equity method investments and Bermuda net deferred tax asset. 
 
 The decrease in ROACE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses, increases in average common shareholders' equity and income tax expense and a decrease in underwriting income, partially offset by net investment gains, an increase in net investment income and decreases in reorganization expenses and corporate expenses. 
 
 The increase in ROACE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by an increase in net investment income, an income tax benefit, decreases in net investment losses and corporate expenses, and increases in interest in income of equity method investments and underwriting income, partially offset by an increase in average common shareholders' equity and foreign exchange losses. 
 
 Operating ROACE excludes the impact of net investment gains (losses), foreign exchange losses (gains), reorganization expenses, interest in income (loss) of equity method investments and Bermuda net deferred tax asset. 
 
 The decrease in operating ROACE for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by increases in average common shareholders' equity and income tax expense and a decrease in underwriting income, partially offset by an increase in net investment income and a decrease in corporate expenses. 
 
 Operating ROACE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was comparable to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in average common shareholders' equity, largely offset by an increase in net investment income, an income tax benefit, a decrease in corporate expenses and an increase in underwriting income.

Book Value per Diluted Common Share 
 
 We consider book value per diluted common share to be an appropriate measure of returns to common shareholders, as we believe growth in book value on a diluted basis will ultimately translate into appreciation of our stock price. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, book value per diluted common share increased by 9.0 due to net income for the period, and net unrealized investment gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by common dividends declared. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, book value per diluted common share increased by 19.6 due to net income for the period, and net unrealized investment gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by common dividends declared. 
 
 Cash Dividends Declared per Common Share and Common Share Repurchases 
 
 We believe in returning excess capital to shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases. Accordingly, dividend policy is an integral part of the value we create for shareholders. Our Board of Directors has approved quarterly common share dividends for twenty-one consecutive years. 
 
 Book Value per Diluted Common Share Adjusted for Dividends 
 
 Taken together, we believe that growth in book value per diluted common share and common share dividends declared represent the total value created for common shareholders. As companies in the insurance industry have differing dividend payout policies, we believe investors use the book value per diluted common share adjusted for dividends metric to measure comparable performance across the industry. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in total value of 5.80, or 10 , was driven by net income for the period, and net unrealized investment gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in total value of 11.91, or 22 , was driven by net income for the period, and net unrealized investment gains recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in total value of 0.63, or 1 , was driven by net income for the period, partially offset by net unrealized investment losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in total value of 5.54, or 12 , was driven by net income for the period.

Rationale for the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We present our results of operations in a way we believe will be meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information to evaluate our performance. Some of the measurements we use are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules and regulations. In this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), we present underwriting-related general and administrative expenses, consolidated underwriting income (loss), current accident year loss ratio, catastrophe and weather-related losses ratio, current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophe and weather-related losses, operating income (loss) (in total and on a per share basis ), annualized operating return on average common equity ("operating ROACE"), amounts presented on a constant currency basis and pre-tax total return on cash and investments excluding foreign exchange movements, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Item 10(e) of SEC Regulation S-K. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, which may be defined and calculated differently by other companies, help explain and enhance the understanding of our results of operations. However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 
 
 Underwriting-Related General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Underwriting-related general and administrative expenses include those general and administrative expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations. While this measure is presented in Item 1, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 'Segment Information' , it is considered a non-GAAP financial measure when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly-traded company. As these costs are not incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations, these costs are excluded from underwriting-related general and administrative expenses, and therefore, consolidated underwriting income (loss). General and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure to underwriting-related general and administrative expenses, also includes corporate expenses. 
 
 The reconciliation of underwriting-related general and administrative expenses to general and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations'. 
 
 Consolidated Underwriting Income (Loss) 
 
 Consolidated underwriting income (loss) is a pre-tax measure of underwriting profitability that takes into account net premiums earned and other insurance related income (loss) as revenues and net losses and loss expenses, acquisition costs and underwriting-related general and administrative expenses as expenses. While this measure is presented in Item 1, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 'Segment Information' , it is considered a non-GAAP financial measure when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. 
 
 We evaluate our underwriting results separately from the performance of our investment portfolio. As a result, we believe it is appropriate to exclude net investment income and net investment gains (losses) from our underwriting profitability measure. 
 
 Foreign exchange losses (gains) in our consolidated statements of operations primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our net insurance-related liabilities. However, we manage our investment portfolio in such a way that unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our investment portfolio, including unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our equity securities, and foreign exchange losses (gains) realized on the sale of our available for sale investments and equity securities recognized in net investment gains (losses), and unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our available for sale investments in other comprehensive income (loss), generally offset a large portion of the foreign exchange losses (gains) arising from our underwriting portfolio, thereby minimizing the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on total shareholders' equity. As a result, we believe that foreign exchange losses (gains) in our consolidated statements of operations in isolation are not a meaningful contributor to our underwriting performance. Therefore, foreign exchange losses (gains) are excluded from consolidated underwriting income (loss). 
 
 Interest expense and financing costs primarily relate to interest payable on our debt and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. As these expenses are not incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations, these expenses are excluded from underwriting-related general and administrative expenses and, therefore, consolidated underwriting income (loss).

Table of Contents 

Reorganization expenses in 2024 primarily relate to severance costs attributable to our "How We Work" program which is focused on simplifying our operating structure. Reorganization expenses in 2023 primarily related to impairments of computer software assets and severance costs attributable to the Company's "How We Work" program which is focused on simplifying the Company s operating structure. Reorganization expenses are primarily driven by business decisions, the nature and timing of which are not related to the underwriting process. Therefore, these expenses are excluded from consolidated underwriting income (loss). 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets arose from business decisions, the nature and timing of which are not related to the underwriting process. Therefore, these expenses are excluded from consolidated underwriting income (loss). 
 
 We believe that the presentation of underwriting-related general and administrative expenses and consolidated underwriting income (loss) provides investors with an enhanced understanding of our results of operations, by highlighting the underlying pre-tax profitability of our underwriting activities. The reconciliation of consolidated underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations' . 
 
 Current Accident Year Loss Ratio 
 Current accident year loss ratio represents net losses and loss expenses ratio exclusive of net favorable (adverse) prior year reserve development. We believe that the presentation of current accident year loss ratio provides investors with an enhanced understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net losses and loss expenses associated with our underwriting activities excluding the impact of volatile prior year reserve development. The reconciliation of current accident year loss ratio to net losses and loss expenses ratio, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations' . 
 
 Catastrophe and Weather-Related Losses Ratio and Current Accident Year Loss Ratio, excluding Catastrophe and Weather-Related Losses 
 Catastrophe and weather-related losses ratio represents net losses and loss expenses ratio associated with natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, other catastrophe events and other weather-related events exclusive of net favorable (adverse) prior year reserve development. 
 
 Current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophe and weather-related losses represents net losses and loss expenses ratio exclusive of net favorable (adverse) prior year reserve development and net losses and loss expenses associated with natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, other catastrophe events and other weather-related events. 
 
 We believe that the presentation of these ratios that separately identify net losses and loss expenses associated with catastrophe and weather-related events provide investors with an enhanced understanding of our results of operations due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the occurrence of these events, the potential magnitude of these losses and the complexity that affects our ability to accurately estimate ultimate losses associated with these events. 
 
 The reconciliation of catastrophe and weather-related losses ratio and current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophe and weather-related losses to net losses and loss expenses ratio, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations' . 
 
 Operating Income (Loss) 
 Operating income (loss) represents after-tax operational results exclusive of net investment gains (losses), foreign exchange losses (gains), reorganization expenses, interest in income (loss) of equity method investments and Bermuda net deferred tax asset. 
 
 Although the investment of premiums to generate income and investment gains (losses) is an integral part of our operations, the determination to realize investment gains (losses) is independent of the underwriting process and is heavily influenced by the availability of market opportunities. Furthermore, many users believe that the timing of the realization of investment gains (losses) is somewhat opportunistic for many companies. 
 
 Foreign exchange losses (gains) in our consolidated statements of operations primarily relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on net insurance-related liabilities. However, we manage our investment portfolio in such a way that unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our investment portfolio, including unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our

Table of Contents 

equity securities and foreign exchange losses (gains) realized on the sale of our available for sale investments and equity securities recognized in net investment gains (losses) and unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains) on our available for sale investments in other comprehensive income (loss), generally offset a large portion of the foreign exchange losses (gains) arising from our underwriting portfolio, thereby minimizing the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on total shareholders' equity. As a result, we believe that foreign exchange losses (gains) in our consolidated statements of operations in isolation are not a meaningful contributor to the performance of our business. Therefore, foreign exchange losses (gains) are excluded from operating income (loss). 
 
 Reorganization expenses in 2024 primarily relate to severance costs attributable to our "How We Work" program which is focused on simplifying our operating structure. Reorganization expenses in 2023 primarily related to impairments of computer software assets and severance costs attributable to the Company's "How We Work" program which is focused on simplifying the Company s operating structure. Reorganization expenses are primarily driven by business decisions, the nature and timing of which are not related to the underwriting process. Therefore, these expenses are excluded from operating income (loss). 
 
 Interest in income (loss) of equity method investments is primarily driven by business decisions, the nature and timing of which are not related to the underwriting process. Therefore, this income (loss) is excluded from operating income (loss). 
 
 Bermuda net deferred tax asset is due to the recognition of deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities related to a future Bermuda corporate income tax rate of 15 , pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Bermuda net deferred tax asset is not related to the underwriting process. Therefore, this income is excluded from operating income (loss). 
 
 Certain users of our financial statements evaluate performance exclusive of after-tax net investment gains (losses), foreign exchange losses (gains), reorganization expenses, interest in income (loss) of equity method investments and Bermuda net deferred tax asset in order to understand the profitability of recurring sources of income. 
 
 We believe that showing net income (loss) available (attributable) to common shareholders exclusive of after-tax net investment gains (losses), foreign exchange losses (gains), reorganization expenses, interest in income (loss) of equity method investments and Bermuda net deferred tax asset reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business. In addition, we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze performance in a manner similar to how our management analyzes the underlying business performance. We also believe this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, facilitates comparison of our performance with our peer group. We believe that equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us, and the insurance industry as a whole, generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. The reconciliation of operating income (loss) to net income (loss) available (attributable) to common shareholders, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented above. 
 
 We also present operating income (loss) per diluted common share and annualized operating ROACE, which are derived from the operating income (loss) measure and are reconciled above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, earnings (loss) per diluted common share and annualized return on average common equity ("ROACE"), respectively. 
 
 Constant Currency Basis 
 We present gross premiums written and net premiums earned on a constant currency basis in this MD A. The amounts presented on a constant currency basis are calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate from the current year to the prior year amounts. We believe this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze growth in gross premiums written and net premiums earned on a constant basis. The reconciliation to gross premiums written and net premiums earned on a GAAP basis is presented in ' Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results by Segment' . 
 
 Pre-Tax Total Return on Cash and Investments excluding Foreign Exchange Movements 
 Pre-tax total return on cash and investments excluding foreign exchange movements measures net investment income (loss), net investments gains (losses), interest in income (loss) of equity method investments, and change in unrealized gains (losses) generated by average cash and investment balances. We believe this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze the performance of our investment portfolio. The reconciliation of pre-tax total return on cash and investments excluding foreign exchange movements to pre-tax total return on cash and investments, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented in ' Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Net Investment Income and Net Investment Gains (Losses)' .

Overview 
 
 The fair value of total investments increased by 1,412 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by the reinvestment of interest income and cashflows from operations, and the increase in market value of fixed maturities due to the decline in yields. 
 
 An analysis of our investment portfolio by asset class is detailed below:

 (3) Non-investment grade and non-rated securities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, fixed maturities had a weighted average credit rating of A+ (2023: AA-), a book yield of 4.4 (2023: 4.2 ), and an average duration of 3.0 years (2023: 3.0 years). At September 30, 2024, fixed maturities together with short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents (i.e. total investments of 15.9 billion) had an average credit rating of AA- (2023: AA-) and an average duration of 2.7 years (2023: 2.7 years). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, net unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 39 million, compared to net unrealized losses of 400 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 361 million due to the improvement in market values and realized losses associated with sales in the period. 
 
 Equity Securities 
 
 At September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains on equity securities were 87 million, compared to 45 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 42 million driven by the improvement in market values, partially offset by realized gains associated with sales in the period.

Mortgage Loans 
 
 At September 30, 2024, investment in commercial mortgage loans was 525 million, compared to 610 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by seven loans which were repaid in full during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The commercial mortgage loans are high quality, and collateralized by a variety of commercial properties and diversified geographically throughout the U.S. and by property type to reduce the risk of concentration. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses of 22 million, was primarily related to commercial properties exposed to the office sector.

 Our ownership interests in Harrington Reinsurance Holdings Limited ("Harrington") and Monarch Point Re (ISAC) Ltd., Monarch Point Re (ISA 2023) Ltd. and Monarch Point Re (ISA 2024) Ltd. (individually or collectively "Monarch Point Re") are reported in interest in income (loss) of equity method investments. 
 
 Interest in income (loss) of equity method investments was 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1 million principally attributable to underwriting losses, largely offset by net investment income related to these ownership interests. 
 
 Interest in income (loss) of equity method investments was 11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8 million principally attributable to net investment income and underwriting income related to these ownership interests.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a general discussion of liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 The following table summarizes consolidated capital: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt 1,314,806 1,313,714 Preferred shares 550,000 550,000 Common equity 5,533,227 4,713,196 Shareholders equity 6,083,227 5,263,196 Total capital 7,398,033 6,576,910 Ratio of debt to total capital 17.8 20.0 
 
 We finance operations with a combination of debt and equity capital. The debt to total capital ratio provides an indication of our capital structure, along with some insight into our financial strength. We believe that our financial flexibility remains strong, and adjustments will be made if there are developments that differ from our expectations. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
 
 The Company's subsidiaries, AXIS Insurance Company and AXIS Surplus Insurance Company, are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago ("FHLB"). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings under the FHLB program of 76 million (2023: 86 million). On September 11, 2024, the Company repaid borrowings under the FHLB program of 10 million, at their stated maturity. 
 
 The FHLB advances have maturities in 2024 and 2025 and interest payable at interest rates between 5.1 and 5.5 (2023: interest rates between 5.5 and 5.7 ). The Company incurred interest expense of 1 million 2023: 1 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 3 million 2023: 3 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The borrowings under the FHLB program are secured by investments with a fair value of 83 million (2023: 95 million) . 
 
 Line of credit 
 
 On March 26, 2024, the 500 million Facility was amended to reduce the committed utilization capacity available under the Facility to 300 million, enter into an uncommitted secured letter credit facility with Citibank Europe plc, and extend the tenors of issuable letters of credit to March 31, 2026 and make certain updates to the facility's collateral and fee arrangements.

Common Equity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, common equity increased by 820 million. The following table reconciles opening and closing common equity positions: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Common equity - opening 4,713,196 Share-based compensation expense 31,229 Change in unrealized gains on available for sale investments, net of tax 
 297,282 Foreign currency translation adjustment (8,184) Net income

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares for a total of 155 million, including 140 million repurchased pursuant to our Board-authorized share repurchase programs and 15 million from employees to satisfy personal withholding tax liabilities that arise on the vesting of share-settled restricted stock units granted under our 2017 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan. 
 
 At June 30, 2024, authorization under the Company's share repurchase program approved in December 2023 was exhausted. 
 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to 300 million of the Company's common shares. The new share repurchase program is open-ended, allowing the Company to repurchase its shares from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. At September 30, 2024, we had 260 million of remaining authorization under our open-ended Board-authorized share repurchase program for common share repurchases (refer to Part II, Item 2 ' Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds ' for further details). 
 We expect cash flows generated from operations, combined with liquidity provided by our investment portfolio, will be sufficient to cover cash outflows and other contractual commitments through the foreseeable future.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are inherently uncertain and judgmental in nature. As a result, we are required to make assumptions and best estimates in order to determine the reported values. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires that significant assumptions be made in order to deal with uncertainties and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 
 We believe the material items requiring such subjective and complex estimates are: 
 reserves for losses and loss expenses; 
 reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, including the allowance for expected credit losses; 
 gross premiums written and net premiums earned; 
 fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities; and 
 the allowance for expected credit losses associated with fixed maturities, available for sale. 
 We believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, continues to describe the significant estimates and judgments included in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we expect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

 Total Net Foreign Currency Exposure 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total net foreign currency assets were 34 million primarily driven by exposures to the Australian dollar, euro, and other non-core currencies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in total net foreign currency exposure was primarily due to new business written in the period.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management has performed an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) at September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Disclosure of Certain Activities Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
 
 Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires issuers to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether they or any of their affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities with Iran or with individuals or entities that are subject to certain sanctions under U.S. law. Issuers are required to provide this disclosure even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside of the U.S. in compliance with applicable law. 
 
 As and when allowed by the applicable law and regulations, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries provide treaty reinsurance coverage to non-U.S. insurers on a worldwide basis, including insurers of liability, marine, aviation and energy risks, and as a result, these underlying insurance and reinsurance portfolios may have some exposure to Iran. In addition, we provide insurance and facultative reinsurance on a global basis to non-U.S. insureds and insurers, including for liability, marine, aviation and energy risks. Coverage provided to non-Iranian business may indirectly cover an exposure in Iran. For example, certain of our operations underwrite global marine hull war and cargo policies that provide coverage for vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide, including Iran. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there has been no material amount of premium allocated or apportioned to activities relating to Iran. We intend for our non-U.S. subsidiaries to continue to provide such coverage only to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
 
 Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company , or is currently party to a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
