 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Partnership have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required for complete annual financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Partnership s Annual Report. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments unless indicated otherwise) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the interim period. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the calendar year. For more information regarding limitations on the forward-looking statements contained herein, see page 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q. Per unit information is calculated by dividing the income or loss applicable to holders of the Partnership s common units by the weighted average number of units outstanding. The Partnership has potentially dilutive securities and, consequently, basic and diluted income per unit do not differ.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. For a description of limitations inherent in forward-looking statements, see page 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Objective 
 
 This discussion, which presents our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We own producing and nonproducing mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits and leasehold interests. We refer to these interests as the Royalty Properties. We currently own Royalty Properties in 594 counties and parishes in 28 states. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we own a net profits overriding royalty interest (referred to as the Net Profits Interest, or NPI in various properties owned by Dorchester Minerals Operating LP (the Operating Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership owned directly and indirectly by our General Partner. We receive a monthly payment from the NPI equaling 96.97 of the net profits actually realized by the Operating Partnership from these properties in the preceding month. In the event that costs, including budgeted capital expenditures, exceed revenues on a cash basis in a given month for properties subject to the Net Profits Interest, no payment is made, and any deficit is accumulated and reflected in the following month's calculation of net profit. 
 
 In the event the NPI has a deficit of cumulative revenue versus cumulative costs, the deficit will be borne solely by the Operating Partnership. 
 
 From a cash perspective, as of September 30, 2024, the NPI was in a surplus position and had outstanding capital commitments, primarily in the Bakken region, equaling cash on hand of 3.3 million. 
 
 Commodity Price Risks 
 
 The pricing of oil and natural gas sales is primarily determined by supply and demand in the global marketplace and can fluctuate considerably. As a royalty owner and non-operator, we have extremely limited access to timely information and no operational control over the volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold or the terms and conditions on which such volumes are marketed and sold. 
 
 Our profitability is affected by oil and natural gas market prices. Oil and natural gas market prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years in response to factors outside of our control, including the war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, fluctuations in interest rates, global supply chain disruptions and actions taken by OPEC+. It is not possible for us to predict or determine how these factors might affect oil and natural gas market prices in the future.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our period-to-period changes in net income and cash flows from operating activities are principally determined by changes in oil and natural gas sales volumes and prices, and to a lesser extent, by capital expenditures deducted under the NPI calculation. Our portion of oil and natural gas sales volumes and average sales prices are shown in the following table. Oil sales volumes include volumes attributable to natural gas liquids and oil sales prices include natural gas liquids prices combined by volumetric proportions.

Both oil and natural gas sales price changes reflected in the table above resulted from changing market conditions. 
 
 The increase in oil sales volumes attributable to our Royalty Properties from the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 to the same periods of 2024 is primarily a result of higher suspense releases on new wells and increased baseline production in the Permian Basin and Bakken region, increased baseline production in South Texas from wells acquired in the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, and higher suspense releases on first time payments and increased baseline production in the Rockies from wells acquired in the first quarter of 2024 and 2022. The increase in natural gas sales volumes attributable to our Royalty Properties from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily a result of higher suspense releases on new wells and increased baseline production in the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and higher suspense releases on first time payments and increased baseline production in the Rockies from wells acquired in the first quarter of 2024 and 2022, partially offset by decreased baseline production and lower suspense releases from first time payments on acquired wells in South Texas. The increase in natural gas sales volumes attributable to our Royalty Properties from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily attributable to higher suspense releases on new wells and increased baseline production in the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent, higher suspense releases on first time payments and increased baseline production in East Texas from wells acquired in the third quarter of 2022, and higher suspense releases from first time payments in the Rockies from wells acquired in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by decreased baseline production and lower suspense releases from first time payments on acquired wells in South Texas and decreased production from legacy wells in the Fayetteville Shale, Barnett Shale, and Southeast. 
 
 The increase in oil sales volumes attributable to our NPI properties from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily the result of increased baseline production in the Permian Basin and Bakken region and higher suspense releases on new wells in the Bakken region, partially offset by lower suspense releases on new wells in the Permian Basin. The decrease in oil sales volumes attributable to our NPI properties from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily the result of lower suspense releases on new wells in the Permian Basin, partially offset by increased baseline production in the Permian Basin and Bakken region and higher suspense releases on new wells in the Bakken region. The increase in natural gas sales volumes attributable to our NPI properties from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily the result of increased baseline production in the Permian Basin, Bakken region, and Mid-Continent. The decrease in natural gas sales volumes attributable to our NPI properties from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024 is primarily the result of lower suspense releases on new wells in the Permian Basin, partially offset by higher suspense releases on new wells in the Bakken region and Mid-Continent and increased baseline production the Permian Basin, Bakken region, and Mid-Continent during the second and third quarters of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 
 Operating costs, including production taxes, increased 11 from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 and 12 from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024. The increases are primarily a result of higher proportionate operating expenses and oil production taxes due to higher oil and natural gas sales volumes and higher oil sales revenue, partially offset by lower proportionate natural gas production taxes due to lower natural gas sales revenue driven by lower natural gas sales prices and lower ad valorem taxes. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 52 from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 and 32 from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024. Depletion is the amount of cost basis of oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of a period attributable to the volume of reserves extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component in the calculation of depletion. We adjust our depletion rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, including recent acquisitions and suspense releases on new wells. 

General and administrative expenses increased 3 from the third quarter of 2023 to the same period of 2024 and 5 from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024. The increases are primarily a result of higher compensation expenses, including an expanded Operating Partnership equity program designed for employee retention, and increased professional service fees, partially offset by a decrease resulting from one-time, non-recurring professional services expenses of 1.2 million related to an unsuccessful acquisition in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent from the first nine months of 2023 to the same period of 2024 primarily due to higher Royalties revenue receipts, net of production taxes and operating expenses, partially offset by lower NPI payment receipts and higher general and administrative expenses. 
 
 In an effort to provide the reader with information concerning prices of oil and natural gas sales that correspond to our quarterly distributions, management calculates the average price by dividing gross revenues received by the net volumes of the corresponding product without regard to the timing of the production to which such sales may be attributable. This indicated price does not necessarily reflect the contract terms for such sales and may be affected by transportation costs, location differentials, and quality and gravity adjustments. While the relationship between our cash receipts and the timing of the production of oil and natural gas may be described generally, actual cash receipts may be materially impacted by purchasers release of suspended funds and by purchasers prior period adjustments. 
 
 Cash receipts attributable to our Royalty Properties during the third quarter of 2024 totaled 40.2 million. Approximately 54 of these receipts reflect oil sales during June 2024 through August 2024 and natural gas sales during May 2024 through July 2024, and approximately 46 from prior sales periods. The average indicated prices for oil and natural gas sales cash receipts attributable to the Royalty Properties during the third quarter of 2024 were 69.91/bbl and 1.08/mcf, respectively. Cash receipts attributable to contributed cash from the two acquisitions closed September 30, 2024, totaled approximately 6.8 million. This generally reflects receipts from the two months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Cash receipts attributable to our NPI during the third quarter of 2024 totaled 6.0 million. Approximately 70 of these receipts reflect oil and natural gas sales during May 2024 through July 2024, and approximately 30 from prior sales periods. The average indicated prices for oil and natural gas sales cash receipts attributable to the NPI properties during the third quarter of 2024 were 65.51/bbl and 1.27/mcf, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of capital, on both a short-term and long-term basis, are our cash flows from the Royalty Properties and the NPI. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute quarterly an amount equal to all funds that we receive from Royalty Properties and NPIs (other than cash proceeds received by the Partnership from a public or private offering of securities of the Partnership) less certain expenses and reasonable reserves. Additional cash requirements include the payment of oil and natural gas production and property taxes not otherwise deducted from gross production revenues and general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated to the Partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement. Because the distributions to our unitholders are, by definition, determined after the payment of all expenses actually paid by us, the only cash requirements that may create liquidity concerns for us are the payment of expenses. Because many of these expenses vary directly with oil and natural gas sales prices and volumes, we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available at all times for payment of these expenses. See Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding cash distributions to unitholders. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 The Partnership leases its office space at 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, through an operating lease (the Office Lease ). The third amendment to our Office Lease was executed in April 2017 for a term of 129 months, beginning June 1, 2018 and expiring in 2029. Under the third amendment to the Office Lease, monthly rental payments range from 25,000 to 30,000. Future maturities of Office Lease liabilities representing monthly cash rental payment obligations as of September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:

We are not directly liable for the payment of any exploration, development or production costs. We do not have any transactions, arrangements or other relationships that could materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. We have not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt. 
 
 To the extent necessary to avoid unrelated business taxable income, our partnership agreement prohibits us from incurring indebtedness, excluding trade payables, in excess of 50,000 in the aggregate at any given time or which would constitute acquisition indebtedness (as defined in Section 514 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). 
 
 We currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund our distributions to unitholders and operations despite potential material uncertainties that may impact us as a result of the ongoing global military conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East and current inflation and interest rates. We cannot predict events that may lead to future oil and natural gas price volatility. Our ability to fund future distributions to unitholders may be affected by the prevailing economic conditions in the oil and natural gas market and other financial and business factors, including the possible resurgence of COVID-19 and any ongoing variants, along with global military conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East, which are beyond our control. If market conditions were to change due to declines in oil prices or uncertainty created by a resurgence of COVID-19 or any ongoing variants and our revenues were reduced significantly or our operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. The current economic environment is volatile, and we cannot predict the ultimate long-term impact on our liquidity or cash flows from factors outside of our control, including those related to COVID-19 or ongoing global military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. 
 
 Liquidity and Working Capital 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 56.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 47.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and related estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023.
