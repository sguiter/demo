Our portfolio securities
are restricted from public sale without prior registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (hereafter, the Securities Act ).
We typically negotiate certain aspects of the method and timing of the disposition of our investment in each portfolio company, including
registration rights and related costs. 

As a business development
company BDC ), we may invest up to 30 of our assets in non-qualifying portfolio investments, as permitted by the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). Specifically, we may invest up to 30 of our assets in entities that are not considered
 eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the 1940 Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities
that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the 1940 Act, and publicly-traded entities with a market capitalization exceeding
 250 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had invested 39.3 of our assets in securities of portfolio companies that constituted qualifying
investments under the 1940 Act. As of September 30, 2024, none of our investments are considered non-qualifying assets, inasmuch as all
of our investments are in enterprises that are considered eligible portfolio companies under the 1940 Act. We provide significant managerial
assistance to our portfolio companies that comprise 100 of the total value of the investments in portfolio securities as of September
30, 2024. 

We are classified as
a non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act, which means we are not limited in the proportion of our assets
that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The value of one segment called Energy includes our two remaining
portfolio companies and was 93.4 of our net asset value, 39.3 of our total assets and 100 of our investments in portfolio company securities
(at fair value) as of September 30, 2024. Changes in business or industry trends or in the financial condition, results of operations,
or the market s assessment of any single portfolio company will affect the net asset value and the market price of our common stock
to a greater extent than would be the case if we were a diversified company holding numerous investments. 

Our investments in
portfolio securities consist of the following types of securities as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

a business development company BDC ), we may invest up to 30 of our assets in non-qualifying portfolio investments, as
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). Specifically, we may invest up to 30 of our assets in entities
that are not considered eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the 1940 Act), including companies located outside of
the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the 1940 Act, and publicly-traded entities with a
market capitalization exceeding 250 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had invested 43.7 of our assets in securities of portfolio
companies that constituted qualifying investments under the 1940 Act. As of December 31, 2023, none of our investments are considered
non-qualifying assets, inasmuch as all of our investments are in enterprises that are considered eligible portfolio companies under the
1940 Act. We provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that comprise 100 of the total value of the investments
in portfolio securities as of December 31, 2023. 

We
are classified as a non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act, which means we are not limited in the proportion
of our assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The value of one segment called Energy includes
our two remaining portfolio companies and was 84.6 of our net asset value, 43.7 of our total assets and 100 of our investments in portfolio
company securities (at fair value) as of December 31, 2023. Changes in business or industry trends or in the financial condition, results
of operations, or the market s assessment of any single portfolio company will affect the net asset value and the market price of
our common stock to a greater extent than would be the case if we were a diversified company holding numerous investments.

EQUUS TOTAL RETURN, INC. 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September 30, 2024 

 (Unaudited) 

(1) Description
of Business and Basis of Presentation 

Description of Business Equus
Total Return, Inc. we, us, our, Equus the Company and the Fund ),
a Delaware corporation, was formed by Equus Investments II, L.P. (the Partnership on August 16, 1991. On July 1, 1992,
the Partnership was reorganized and all of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership were transferred to the Fund in exchange for
shares of common stock of the Fund. Our shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol EQS .
On August 11, 2006, our shareholders approved the change of the Fund s investment strategy to a total return investment objective.
This strategy seeks to provide the highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income. In connection with this
strategic investment change, the shareholders also approved the change of name from Equus II Incorporated to Equus Total Return, Inc.
As of September 30, 2024, we had 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance,
of which 13,568,173 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 

We attempt to maximize
the return to stockholders in the form of current investment income and long-term capital gains by investing in the debt and equity securities
of companies with a total enterprise value between 5.0 million and 75.0 million, although we may engage in transactions with smaller
or larger investee companies from time to time. We seek to invest primarily in companies pursuing growth either through acquisition or
organically, leveraged buyouts, management buyouts and recapitalizations of existing businesses or special situations. Our income-producing
investments consist principally of debt securities including subordinated debt, debt convertible into common or preferred stock, or debt
combined with warrants and common and preferred stock. Debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create long-term capital
appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing. We seek to achieve capital appreciation
by making investments in equity and equity-oriented securities issued by privately-owned companies in transactions negotiated directly
with such companies. Given market conditions over the past several years and the performance of our portfolio, our Management and Board
of Directors believe it prudent to continue to review alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies. 

We elected to be treated
as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act 1940 Act ), although our shareholders authorized us to withdraw this
election in previous years (which authorization has since expired) and will likely do so again in the future. We currently qualify as
a regulated investment company RIC for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not required to pay corporate income
taxes on any income or gains that we distribute to our stockholders. We have two wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries Taxable Subsidiary which hold one or more of our portfolio investments listed on our Schedules of Investments. The purpose of these and other Taxable Subsidiaries
we may form is to permit us to hold certain income- producing investments or portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies,
or LLCs, (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90 of our gross revenue for
income tax purposes must consist of investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiaries, a portion of the gross income of these income-producing
investments or of any LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment, as the case may be, would flow through directly to us for
the 90 test. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC
and, therefore, cause us to incur significant federal income taxes. The income of the LLCs (or other pass-through entities) owned by Taxable
Subsidiaries is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiaries and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant
tax advantages. We do not consolidate the Taxable Subsidiaries for income tax purposes, with the exception of Texas Margins Tax, which
is an entity level tax. The Taxable Subsidiaries may generate income tax expense because of the Taxable Subsidiaries ownership
of the portfolio companies. We reflect any such income tax expense on our Statements of Operations. 

Impact of Economic
and Geopolitical Events on the Oil and Gas Sector Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, crude prices began a steady decline
following increases that were largely due to increased post-Covid demand and the buildup and subsequent invasion of Ukraine by Russian
forces. Prices began to rise and fall in successive quarters between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024, and stood
at 68.27 as of September 30, 2024. Natural gas prices experienced high volatility in 2022 before collapsing in 2023 and have thereafter
remained generally stable, finishing the first nine months of 2024 at 2.92 per MMBTU. Relative oil price stability has been a significant
factor in increased consolidation activity in the Permian Basin where Equus Energy holds most of its development rights, as well as in
the Williston Basin region in North Dakota where Morgan E P, LLC holds its development rights.

Basis of Presentation In
accordance with Article 6 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange
Act ), we do not consolidate portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest. Our interim
unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), for interim financial information and in accordance with the requirements of reporting on Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X, under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, they are unaudited and exclude some disclosures required for annual financial
statements. We believe that we have made all adjustments necessary for the fair statement
of these interim financial statements. 

The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the
remainder of the year. The interim unaudited financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Fund s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the
SEC. 

(2) Liquidity
and Financing Arrangements; Going Concern 

Liquidity There
are several factors that may materially affect our liquidity during the reasonably foreseeable future. We are evaluating the impact of
current market conditions on our portfolio company valuations and their ability to provide current income. We have followed valuation
techniques in a consistent manner; however, we are cognizant of current market conditions that might affect future valuations of portfolio
securities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.1 million. We had 37.5 million of our net assets of 40.2 million invested
in portfolio securities. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and
cash equivalents of 6.5 million. We had 40.9 million of our net assets of 48.3 million invested in portfolio securities. 

We exclude Restricted
Cash and U.S. Treasury Bills used for purposes of complying with RIC requirements from cash equivalents. 

Restricted Cash
and U.S. Treasury Bills As of September 30, 2024, we had 55.5 million of restricted cash and U.S. Treasury Bills, including
primarily the proceeds of a quarter-end margin loan that we incurred to maintain the diversification requirements applicable to a RIC.
Of this amount, 55.0 million was invested in U.S. Treasury Bills and 0.5 million represented a required 1 brokerage margin deposit.
These securities were held by a securities brokerage firm and pledged along with other assets to secure repayment of the margin loan.
The U.S. Treasury Bills matured in October 2024, and we subsequently repaid this margin loan, plus interest. 

As of December 31,
2023, we had 45.4 million of restricted cash and of U.S. Treasury Bills, including primarily the proceeds of a quarter-end margin loan
that we incurred to maintain the diversification requirements applicable to a RIC. Of this amount, 45.0 million was invested in U.S.
Treasury Bills and 0.4 million represented a required 1 brokerage margin deposit. These securities were held by a securities brokerage
firm and pledged along with other assets to secure repayment of the margin loan. The U.S. Treasury Bills matured January 4, 2024 and we
subsequently repaid this margin loan, plus interest. 

Dividends So
long as we remain a BDC, we will pay out net investment income and/or realized net capital gains, if any, on an annual basis as required
under the 1940 Act. 

Investment Commitments Under
certain circumstances, we may be called on to make follow-on investments in certain portfolio companies. If we do not have sufficient
funds to make follow-on investments, the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted. Also, our equity interest
in the estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced. We had no follow-on commitments as of September 30, 2024.

 Table of Contents 

RIC Borrowings,
Restricted Cash and U.S. Treasury Bills We may periodically borrow sufficient funds to maintain the Fund s RIC status
by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm. We cannot assure you that any such arrangement will be available in the
future. If we are unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments, we may no longer qualify as a RIC. We would then be subject to
corporate income tax on the Fund s net investment income and realized capital gains, and distributions to stockholders would be
subject to income tax as ordinary dividends. If we remain a BDC and do not become an operating company as described in Note 6 
 Conversion to an Operating Company below, our failure to continue to qualify as a RIC could be materially adverse to us and our
stockholders. 

As of September 30,
2024, we borrowed 55.0 million to maintain our RIC status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm. We collateralized
such borrowings with restricted cash and investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of 55.5 million. 

As of December 31,
2023, we borrowed 45.0 million to maintain our RIC status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm. We collateralized
such borrowings with restricted cash and investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of 45.4 million. 

Asset Coverage
Ratio Under the 1940 Act, BDCs are required to have an asset coverage ratio of 200 , meaning that the maximum debt that may
be incurred by a BDC is the BDC s net asset value. Pursuant to amendments made to the 1940 Act in March 2018, BDCs may now, with
stockholder or board of directors approval, reduce this ratio to 150 , meaning that the maximum debt that may be incurred by a BDC is
two times the BDC s net asset value. In November 2019, we obtained approval of our shareholders to reduce our asset coverage ratio
to 150 . This authorization permits Equus to borrow up to twice the value of the Fund s net assets. Other than the margin loan obtained
by the Fund from time to time to acquire U.S. Treasury bills to maintain our RIC status as described above, we have not yet undertaken
any other additional borrowings. 

Certain Risks and
Uncertainties and Going Concern Market and economic volatility which has become endemic in the past few years, together with
the economic dislocation caused by the onset of the coronavirus, has constrained the availability of debt financing for small and medium-sized
companies such as Equus and its portfolio companies. Such debt financing generally has shorter maturities, higher interest rates and fees,
and more restrictive terms than debt facilities available in the past. In addition, during these years and continuing into the fourth
quarter of 2024, the price of our common stock remained well below our net asset value, thereby making it undesirable to issue additional
shares of our common stock below net asset value. 

Because of these challenges,
our near-term strategies shifted from originating debt and equity investments to preserving liquidity necessary to meet our operational
needs. Key initiatives that we have previously undertaken to provide necessary liquidity include monetizations, the suspension of dividends
and the internalization of management. We are also evaluating potential opportunities that could enable us to effect a change to our business
and become an operating company as described in Note 6 Conversion to an Operating Company . 

The accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements of the Fund have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. 

Our cash and cash equivalents
totaled 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and our net cash flows used in operating activities net of financing activities used to
purchase the U.S. Treasury Bills for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, were 5.3 million), which included our follow-on investment
in Morgan E P of 2.2 million made in January and February 2024. We do not currently have the necessary cash on hand and/or projected
future cash flows to fund our operating activities. It is possible the Fund will require loans, capital investment from one or more sources,
or will be required to dispose of certain of its investments, to cover a potential cash shortfall. The Fund does not presently have any
existing commitments to fund any such shortfall, should it occur, and cannot guarantee that it will be able to execute on such plans in
the future. Because we do not currently have committed financing to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the issuance of
these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The unaudited condensed
financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amount,
or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Fund be unable to continue as a going concern.

(3) Significant
Accounting Policies 

The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of our financial statements: 

Earnings Per Share Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Other potentially dilutive common stock, and the related impact to earnings,
are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. 

Use of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Although we
believe the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these financial statements and related notes are reasonable in light of known
facts and circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified valuation of investments and revenue recognition
as our most critical accounting estimates. 

Consolidation In
accordance with Article 6 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, we do not consolidate portfolio company investments. Under
Accounting Standards Committee ASC 946, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company,
except that ASC 946 provides for the consolidation of a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to
the investment company or its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Valuation of Investments For
most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily
available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board has approved a multi-step valuation process
each quarter, as described below: 

1. 
 Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals; 

2. 
 With certain exceptions as determined by our Management, with respect to investments with a fair value exceeding 2.5 million that have been held for more than one year, we engage independent valuation firms to assist our investment professionals. These independent valuation firms conduct independent valuations and make their own independent assessments; 

3. 
 Our Management produces a report that summarizes each of our portfolio investments and recommends a fair value of each such investment as of the date of the report; 

4. 
 The Audit Committee of our Board reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of our portfolio investments as recommended by Management in their report and any reports or recommendations of the independent valuation firms, and then approves and recommends the fair values of our investments so determined to our Board for final approval; and 

5. 
 The Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each portfolio investment in good faith based on the input of our Management, the respective independent valuation firm, as applicable, and the Audit Committee. 

15 

 Table of Contents 

During the
first twelve months after an investment is made, we rely on the original investment amount to determine the fair value unless significant
developments have occurred during this twelve-month period which would indicate a material effect on the portfolio company (such as results
of operations or changes in general market conditions). 

 Investments
are valued utilizing various methodologies and approaches, including a yield analysis, enterprise value EV analysis,
net asset value analysis, liquidation analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, or a combination of methods, as appropriate. The yield
analysis uses loan spreads and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
Under the EV analysis, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company s securities
in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use
a market multiples approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics
from precedent M A transactions and/or a discounted cash flow analysis. The net asset value analysis is used to derive a value of
an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate.
For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant
transactions. The liquidation analysis is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things,
assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company s assets. The discounted
cash flow analysis uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate
may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market
expectations about those future amounts. 

 In estimating
the fair values of our equity interest in Equus Energy, we have given more emphasis to a market approach that examines developed and undeveloped
reserves and mineral acreage values, as well as a market approach that examines comparable industry transactions involving oil and gas
assets in proximity to the leasehold interests held by Equus Energy. In estimating the fair values of our equity interest in Morgan, we
have given more emphasis to a market approach that examines Morgan s reserves and production multiples, as well as an income approach
that examines expected cash flows from the development of leasehold interests held by Morgan. Our management received advice and assistance
from a third-party valuation firm to support our determination of the fair value of these investments. 

 In applying these methodologies,
additional factors that we consider in fair value pricing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection
provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments;
the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal
market; and enterprise values, among other factors. Also, any failure by a portfolio company to achieve its business plan or obtain and
maintain its financing arrangements could result in increased volatility and result in a significant and rapid change in its value. 

We perform a
yield analysis assuming a hypothetical current sale of the security to determine the fair value of our privately held debt investments. The
yield analysis considers changes in interest rates and changes in leverage levels of the portfolio company as compared to the market
interest rates and leverage levels. Assuming the credit quality of the portfolio company remains stable, the Fund will use the value
determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security. 

16 

 Table of Contents 

We record unrealized
depreciation on investments when we determine that the fair value of a security is less than its cost basis and will record unrealized
appreciation when we determine that the fair value is greater than its cost basis. 

Fair Value Measurement Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined
as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described
below: 

Level 1 Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement
date. 

Level 2 Inputs
other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and fair value
is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. 

Level 3 Inputs
are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.
The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information under the circumstances and may require significant
management judgment or estimation. 

In certain cases, the
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level
within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment
of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific
to the investment. 

Investments for which
prices are not observable are generally private investments in the debt and equity securities of operating companies. A primary valuation
method used to estimate the fair value of these Level 3 investments is the discounted cash flow method (although a liquidation analysis,
option theoretical, or other methodology may be used when more appropriate). The discounted cash flow approach to determine fair value
(or a range of fair values) involves applying an appropriate discount rate(s) to the estimated future cash flows using various relevant
factors depending on investment type, including comparing the latest arm s length or market transactions involving the subject security
to the selected benchmark credit spread, assumed growth rate (in cash flows), and capitalization rates/multiples (for determining terminal
values of underlying portfolio companies). The valuation based on the inputs determined to be the most reasonable and probable is used
as the fair value of the investment. In the case of our investments in Equus Energy and Morgan, we also examine acreage values in comparable
transactions and assess the impact upon the working interests held by these two portfolio companies. The determination of fair value using
these methodologies may take into consideration a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was
acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current
and projected operating performance, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and anticipated financing
transactions after the valuation date. 

17 

 Table of Contents 

To assess the reasonableness
of the discounted cash flow approach, the fair value of equity securities, including warrants, in portfolio companies may also consider
the market approach that is, through analyzing and applying to the underlying portfolio companies, market valuation multiples of
publicly-traded firms engaged in businesses similar to those of the portfolio companies. The market approach to determining the fair value
of a portfolio company s equity security (or securities) will typically involve: (1) applying to the portfolio company s trailing
twelve months (or current year projected) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA a low
to high range of enterprise value to EBITDA multiples that are derived from an analysis of publicly-traded comparable companies, in order
to arrive at a range of enterprise values for the portfolio company; (2) subtracting from the range of calculated enterprise values the
outstanding balances of any debt or equity securities that would be senior in right of payment to the equity securities we hold; and (3)
multiplying the range of equity values derived therefrom by our ownership share of such equity tranche in order to arrive at a range of
fair values for our equity security (or securities). Application of these valuation methodologies involves a significant degree of judgment
by Management. 

Due to the inherent
uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of
the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and
may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal
and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment
in a forced or liquidation sale, we might realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.
With respect to Level 3 investments, where sufficient market quotations are not readily available or for which no or an insufficient number
of indicative prices from pricing services or brokers or dealers have been received, we undertake, on a quarterly basis, our valuation
process as described above. 

18 

 Table of Contents 

We assess the levels
of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the subsequent measurement date closest in
time to the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers to or from Level 3 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023.

Fair value measurements
can be sensitive to changes in one or more of the valuation inputs. Changes in discount rates, EBITDA or EBITDA multiples (or revenue
or revenue multiples), each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of our investments. Generally, an increase/(decrease) in
market yields, discount rates, or an increase/(decrease) in EBITDA or EBITDA multiples (or revenue or revenue multiples) may result in
a corresponding increase/(decrease), respectively, in the fair value of certain of our investments. In the case of our holdings in Equus
Energy and Morgan, we also consider acreage value, proved reserve multiples, daily production multiples, and discount rates.

The various weighted averages
in the table above were determined based on acreage, reserves, production and, in the case of discount rates, an arithmetic average of
minimum and maximum rates. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable
market values, our fair value determinations may materially differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed
for the securities. 

We adjust our net asset
value for the changes in the value of our publicly held securities, if applicable, and material changes in the value of private securities,
generally determined on a quarterly basis or as announced in a press release, and report those amounts to Lipper Analytical Services,
Inc. Our net asset value appears in various publications, including Barron s and The Wall Street Journal . 

Investment Transactions 
Investment transactions are recorded at fair value on the trade date. Current-period changes in fair value of investments are reflected
as a component of the net unrealized appreciation of portfolio securities on the Statements of Operations. The net change in unrealized
appreciation primarily reflects the change in investment fair values as of the last business day of the reporting period, including the
reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses for investments sold during the period. Realized gains or losses are recognized
as the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment
using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments written
off during the period, net of recoveries. As September 30, 2024, we have no assets going through foreclosure. Realized gains and losses
on investments sold are computed on a specific identification basis. 

22 

 Table of Contents 

We classify our investments
in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, Control Investments are defined as investments
in companies in which the Fund owns more than 25 of the voting securities or maintains greater than 50 of the board representation.
Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments are defined as those non-control investments in companies in which we own between
5 and 25 of the voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, Non-affiliate Investments are defined as investments that are neither
Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. 

Interest and Dividend
Income Recognition We record interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual
basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We accrete or amortize discounts and premiums on securities purchased over
the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted
for the accretion of discount and/or amortization of premium on debt securities. We stop accruing interest on investments when we determine
that interest is no longer collectible. We may also impair the accrued interest when we determine that all or a portion of the current
accrual is uncollectible. If we receive any cash after determining that interest is no longer collectible, we treat such cash as payment
on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid, before we recognize any additional interest income. We will
write off uncollectible interest upon the occurrence of a definitive event such as a sale, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the relevant
portfolio interest. Dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared by the portfolio company
or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. 

Net Realized Gains
or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference
between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of an investment or a financial instrument and the cost basis of the investment or
financial instrument, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off
during the period net of recoveries and realized gains or losses from in-kind redemptions. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation
reflects the net change in the fair value of the portfolio company investments and financial instruments and the reclassification of any
prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments and financial instruments to realized gains or losses. 

Payment in Kind
Interest (PIK) From time to time, we have loans in our portfolio that may pay PIK interest. We add PIK interest, if any, computed
at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. To maintain
our status as a RIC, we must pay out to stockholders this non-cash source of income in the form of dividends even if we have not yet collected
any cash in respect of such investments. To the extent we remain BDC and a RIC, we will continue to pay out net investment income and/or
realized capital gains, if any, on an annual basis as required under the 1940 Act. 

Earnings Per Share Basic
and diluted per share calculations are computed utilizing the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, the unvested shares of restricted stock awarded pursuant
to our equity compensation plans are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the basic earnings per share calculation.
As a result, for all periods presented, there is no difference between diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share amounts. 

Distributable Earnings The
components that make up distributable earnings (accumulated undistributed deficit) on the Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:

Taxes So
long as we remain a BDC, we intend to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code necessary to qualify as a RIC and, as
such, will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income (including net realized capital gains) which is distributed
to stockholders. We borrow money from time to time to maintain our tax status under the Internal Revenue Code as a RIC. See Note 1 for
discussion of Taxable Subsidiaries and see Note 2 for further discussion of the Fund s RIC borrowings.

Texas margin tax applies
to legal entities conducting business in Texas. The margin tax is based on our Texas sourced taxable margin. The tax is calculated by
applying a tax rate to a base that considers both revenue and expenses and therefore has the characteristics of an income tax. As a result,
we have no provision for margin tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and we expect no in state income tax for the
year ended December 31, 2023. 

Cash Flows For
purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We exclude Restricted Cash and U.S. Treasury Bills used for purposes of
complying with RIC requirements from cash equivalents. 

The following table
provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sums
to the total of the same amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Recent Accounting Standards We
consider the applicability and impact of all accounting standard updates ASU issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB ). ASUs not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or expected to have minimal
impact on our financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Recently
Adopted In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Fair Value Measurement of Equity
Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , which was issued to (1) clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement,
when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security,
(2) to amend a related illustrative example, and (3) to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual
sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2023. There was no impact on the financial statements or financial statement disclosures. 

(4) 
 Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
 
 Except as noted below,
as compensation for services to the Fund, each Independent Director receives an annual fee of 40,000 paid quarterly in arrears, a fee
of 2,000 for each meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof attended in person, a fee of 1,000 for participation in each
telephonic meeting of the Board or committee thereof, and reimbursement of all out-of-pocket expenses relating to attendance at such meetings.
The chair of each of our standing committees (audit, compensation, and nominating and governance) also receives an annual fee of 50,000,
payable quarterly in arrears. We may also pay other one-time or recurring fees to members of our Board of Directors in special circumstances.
None of our interested directors receive annual fees for their service on the Board of Directors. 

In respect of services
provided to the Fund by members of the Board not in connection with their roles and duties as directors, the Fund pays a rate of 300
per hour for such services. 

(5) Portfolio
Securities 

 In the second quarter
of 2023, we established Morgan E P, LLC Morgan as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund. In May 2023, we entered
into an agreement with Morgan to provide it up to 10.0 million in senior debt financing, subject to a schedule of disbursements and
draws that we determine. Morgan utilized 500,000 of this facility to acquire its initial 4,747.52 net acres, in the Bakken/Three Forks
formation in the Williston Basin of North Dakota as described in Note 9 - Morgan E P, LLC below. During the third quarter
of 2023, Morgan also acquired an additional 1,100 net acres in this region. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Morgan sold certain of
its wellbore interest in its initial two wells to a third party for 5.6 million in cash in exchange for a net revenue interest of approximately
27 in these wells. During the second quarter of 2024, Morgan acquired an additional 810 net acres proximate to its other acreage holdings. 

24 

 Table of Contents 

In February 2024, we
amended our credit facility with Morgan and increased the total amount that may be drawn under the facility from 10.0 to 10.5 million
and, during the first quarter of 2024, we advanced Morgan an additional 2.2 million thereunder. As of September 30, 2024, our debt facility
with Morgan had been fully drawn. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a decrease in the fair value of the equity
of Morgan of 3.6 million, from 22.6 million to 19.0 million, principally due to adverse changes in oil prices, decreases in production
during the period, and a combination of other qualitative and quantitative factors affecting Morgan during the period. 

 During the
first nine months of 2024, WTI prices decreased from 71.65 per barrel at December 31, 2023 to 68.27 at September 30, 2024. Gas prices
increased from 2.63 at December 31, 2023 to 2.92 at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Principally due to a decrease in oil prices,
we recorded a decrease in the fair value of Equus Energy of 2.0 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, from 10.0
million to 8.0 million. 

 During the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, notwithstanding price decreases for oil and natural gas in the period, primarily due to stable
prices for mineral acreage transactions in the principal region where Equus Energy, LLC, holds its leasehold interests, we recorded no
change in the fair value of this investment. 

 (6) Conversion
to an Operating Company 

 Authorization to
Withdraw BDC Election In previous years, holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Fund approved our cessation
as a BDC under the 1940 Act and authorized our Board to cause the Fund s withdrawal of its election to be classified as a BDC, effective
as of a date designated by the Board and our Chief Executive Officer. Although this authorization has since expired, we expect to receive
a further authorization from our shareholders later in 2024 or 2025 as a consequence of our expressed intent to transform Equus into an
operating company. Notwithstanding any such authorization to withdraw our BDC election, we will not submit any such withdrawal unless
and until Equus has entered into a definitive agreement to effect a transformative transaction. Further, even if we are again authorized
to withdraw our election as a BDC, we will require a subsequent affirmative vote from holders of a majority of our outstanding voting
shares to enter into any such definitive agreement or change the nature of our business. While we are presently evaluating various opportunities
that could enable us to accomplish this transformation, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so within any particular time
period or at all, and, although we expect that our shareholders will grant a further authorization, we do not expect to cause the Fund
to withdraw its election to be classified as BDC prior to December 31, 2024. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the terms of any such
transformative transaction would be acceptable to us. 

(7) 2016
Equity Incentive Plan 

 Share-Based Incentive
Compensation On June 13, 2016, our shareholders approved the adoption of our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan Incentive Plan ).
On January 10, 2017, the SEC issued an order approving the Incentive Plan and certain awards intended to be made thereunder. The Incentive
Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Fund by encouraging officers, employees, and directors of the Fund and its affiliates
to acquire or increase their equity interest in the Fund and to provide a means whereby they may develop a proprietary interest in the
development and financial success of the Fund, to encourage them to remain with and devote their best efforts to the business of the Fund,
thereby advancing the interests of the Fund and its stockholders. The Incentive Plan is also intended to enhance the ability of the Fund
and its affiliates to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential for the growth and profitability of the Fund. The
Incentive Plan permits the award of restricted stock as well as common stock purchase options. The maximum number of shares of common
stock that are subject to awards granted under the Incentive Plan is 2,434,728 shares. The term of the Incentive Plan will expire on June
13, 2026. On March 17, 2017, we granted awards of restricted stock under the Incentive Plan to certain of our directors and executive
officers in the aggregate amount of 844,500 shares. The awards are each subject to a vesting requirement over a 3-year period unless the
recipient thereof is terminated or removed from their position as a director or executive officer without cause , or as a
result of constructive termination, as such terms are defined in the respective award agreements entered into by each of the recipients
and the Fund. As of June 30, 2020, all awards granted under the Incentive Plan were fully vested. We account for share-based compensation
using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718. Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, we measure the grant date fair value
based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and amortize the fair value of the awards as share-based compensation
expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term.

 Equus Energy, LLC 

Equus Energy, LLC Equus
Energy was formed in November 2011 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund to make investments in companies in the energy sector,
with particular emphasis on income-producing oil gas properties. In December 2011, we contributed 250,000 to the capital of Equus
Energy. On December 27, 2012, we invested an additional 6.8 million in Equus Energy for the purpose of additional working capital and
to fund the purchase of 6.6 million in working interests presently consisting of 136 producing and non- producing oil and gas wells.
On September 30, 2020, the Fund provided an additional 0.6 million in capital to Equus Energy for the purpose of additional working capital.
On June 30, 2021, the Fund provided an additional 0.35 million in capital to Equus Energy for the purpose of additional working capital.
On December 31, 2022, the Fund provided an additional 0.15 million in capital to Equus Energy for the purpose of additional working capital.
The working interests include associated development rights of approximately 21,320 acres situated on 9 separate properties in Texas and
Oklahoma. The working interests range from a de minimus amount to 50 of the leasehold that includes these wells. 

The wells are operated
by a number of operators, including Burk Royalty, which has operating responsibility for all of Equus Energy s 22 producing well
interests located in the Conger Field, a productive oil and gas field on the edge of the Permian Basin that has experienced successful
gas and hydrocarbon extraction in multiple formations. Equus Energy, which holds a 50 working interest in each of these Conger Field
wells, is seeking to effect a recompletion program of existing Conger Field wells to the Wolfcamp formation, a zone containing oil as
well as gas and natural gas liquids. Part of Equus Energy s acreage rights described above also includes a 50 working interest
in possible new drilling to the base of the Canyon formation (appx. 8,500 feet) on 2,400 acres in the Conger Field. Also included in the
interests acquired by Equus Energy are working interests of 7.5 and 2.5 in the Burnell and North Pettus Units, respectively, which collectively
comprise approximately 13,000 acres located in the area known as the Eagle Ford Shale play. 

Beginning in the second
quarter of 2022, crude prices began a steady decline following increases that were largely due to increased post-Covid demand and the
buildup and subsequent invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. Prices began to rise and fall in successive quarters between the third quarter
of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024, and stood at 68.27 as of September 30, 2024. Natural gas prices experienced high volatility in
2022 before collapsing in 2023 and have thereafter remained generally stable, finishing the first nine months of 2024 at 2.92 per MMBTU.
Relative oil price stability has been a significant factor in increased consolidation activity in the Permian Basin where Equus Energy
holds most of its development rights. On October 8, 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration issued estimates of 79.91 and 73.13
for the average WTI price per barrel of oil for the years 2024 and 2025, respectively, and estimated average gas prices of 2.30 and 3.10
for 2024 and 2025, respectively. 

Notwithstanding present
pricing conditions and forecasts, operators of the leasehold interests held by Equus Energy have not yet undertaken significant capital
expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect upon the operations and long-term financial condition of Equus Energy. To conserve
existing cash resources or create additional cash resources during the next year, Equus Energy intends to either: (i) attempt to secure
equity or debt financing from one or more institutional sources, which sources may include the Fund, a commercial lender, or other investors,
(ii) request that its operators shut-in additional wells, (iii) sell certain of its oil and gas holdings, or (iv) undertake a combination
of the foregoing. However, we cannot assure you that Equus Energy will be able to implement these plans successfully, or that such plans
will generate sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern. The factors discussed above, therefore, raise substantial doubt about
Equus Energy s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Going-Concern The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Equus Energy have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. As
such, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of assets and their carrying amount, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should Equus Energy be unable to
continue as a going concern. It is possible Equus Energy will require loans or capital investment from one or more sources, or will be
required to dispose of certain of its assets, to cover a potential cash shortfall. Equus Energy does not presently have any existing commitments
to fund any such shortfall, should it occur, and cannot guarantee that it will be able to secure a commitment in the future.

Revenue and Income During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, Equus Energy s revenue, operating revenue less direct operating expenses, and net loss
were 119 thousand, 6) thousand, and 54) thousand, respectively, as compared to revenue, operating revenue less direct operating expenses,
and net loss of 137 thousand, 41 thousand, and 28) thousand, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, Equus Energy s revenue, operating revenue less direct operating expenses, and net loss were 484 thousand,
 156 thousand, and 52) thousand, respectively, as compared to revenue, operating revenue less direct operating expenses, and net income
of 455 thousand, 47 thousand, and 5 thousand, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Capital Expenditures During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Equus Energy s investment, respectively, in capital expenditures
for small repairs and improvements was not significant. 

We do not consolidate
Equus Energy or its wholly-owned subsidiaries and accordingly only the value of our investment in Equus Energy is included on our balance
sheets. Our investment in Equus Energy is valued in accordance with our normal valuation procedures and is based in part on a reserve
report, dated January 1, 2024, prepared for Equus Energy by Lee Keeling Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm,
the transactions and values of comparable companies in this sector, and the estimated value of leasehold mineral interests associated
with the acreage held by Equus Energy. A valuation of Equus Energy was performed by a third-party valuation firm, who recommended a value
range of Equus Energy consistent with the fair value determined by our Management (See Schedule of Investments). 

Below is summarized
unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for Equus Energy as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in thousands):

Critical Accounting Policies for Equus Energy 

 Oil Gas Properties Equus
Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiary EQS Energy Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the Company follow the Full Cost Method
of Accounting for oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration, and
development activities are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisitions, geological and geophysical work, delay rentals,
costs of drilling, completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related costs. Gains or losses are normally
not recognized on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties. Gains or losses are normally reflected as an adjustment to
the full cost pool. Any excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected
as additional impairment in the accompanying statements of operations. 

The capitalized costs
of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated cost of dismantlement and
abandonment, net of salvage value, are amortized on a unit-of-production method over the estimated productive life of the proved oil and
gas reserves. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion
expense for the Company s oil and gas properties totaled 14 thousand and 3 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. 

Capitalized oil and gas property costs are limited
to an amount (the ceiling limitation) equal to the sum of the following: 

(a) 
 As of September 30, 2024, the present value of estimated future net revenue from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves, calculated at the simple arithmetic average, first-day-of-the-month prices during the twelve-month period before the balance sheet date (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) and a discount factor of 10 ; 

(b) 
 The cost of investments in unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized; and 

(c) 
 The lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. 

When it is determined
that oil and gas property costs exceed the ceiling limitation, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce its carrying value to the ceiling
limitation. The Company recognized no impairment loss on its oil and gas properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. 

The costs of certain
unevaluated leasehold acreage and certain wells being drilled are not amortized. The Company excludes all costs until proved reserves
are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. Costs not amortized are periodically assessed for possible impairment
or reduction in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs being amortized are increased accordingly. 

Revenue Recognition The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. 

The Company s
revenue is generated primarily from the sale of oil, gas and natural gas liquids NGL produced from working interests and
to a lesser extent from royalty interests in oil and gas properties owned by the Company. As a working interest owner, the Company is
responsible for the incurred production expenses proportionate to the interest stipulated in the operating agreement. As a non-operator,
the Company does not manage the daily well operations, which are borne by the well operator. Sales of oil, gas and NGLs are recognized
at the time control of the product is transferred to the customer. 

Various arrangements
amongst the eleven different oil and gas properties all differ in some respects, although they do share the commonality that, as a non-operating
working interest holder, the Company does not engage in the selling process, but instead relies on the operator, as their selling agent,
for negotiating and determining pricing, volume, and delivery terms. Such pricing terms are often a function of a specified discount from
the daily/monthly NYMEX or Henry Hub average. The discount is usually based on differentials such as distance of the field/wells from
the distribution node or the buyer s storage facility, as well as the quality of the product itself (i.e., in the case of oil, its
gravity). 

30 

 Table of Contents 

Revenue is measured
based on consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The
Company recognizes revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring control
of those goods to the customer. The contract consideration is typically allocated to specific performance obligations in the contract
according to the terms of the contract. Each unit of oil or gas is considered a separate performance obligation under the contract. Wells
are spot measured once a month to determine production and the composition of each of the products (i.e. oil, gas, NGLs) from the well.
Each month the consideration obtained by the operator is allocated to the related performance obligations. 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation
is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract s
transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation
is satisfied. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with contractual terms, in an amount that
reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for services rendered. 

Depending on the contract
and commodity, there are various means by which upstream entities can transfer control (i.e., at the wellhead, inlet, tailgate of the
processing plant, or a location where the product is delivered to a third party). The Company has control of the commodity before it is
extracted, therefore consideration must be given to whether the transfer of control of the commodity is to the operator or to the end
customer at the point of sale. 

Unless special arrangements
are entered into, the Company s performance obligations are generally considered performed when control of the extracted commodity
transfers when it is delivered to the end customer at the agreed-upon market or index price. At the end of each month, when the performance
obligation is satisfied, the variable consideration can be reasonably estimated. Variances between the Company s estimated revenue
and actual payments are recorded in the month the payment is received. 

Principal vs. Agent 

While the guidance
on principal versus agent considerations is similar to legacy GAAP, the key difference is that ASC 606 focuses on control of the specified
goods and services as the overarching principle for entities to consider when determining whether they are acting as a principal or an
agent. This could result in entities reaching different conclusions than they did under legacy GAAP. 

An entity acting as a principal
records revenue on a gross basis if it controls a promised good or service before transferring that good or service to the customer. An
entity is an agent if it does not control the promised good or service before transfer to the customer. If the entity is an agent, it
records as revenue the net amount it retains for its agency services. However, due to the uncertainty of the variable pricing component
and the separation of expenses billed to the Company from the consideration processed and paid by the operator, the revenue is recorded
at net. 

Under the Company s normal
operating activity arrangements, the operator is responsible for negotiating, fulfilling and collecting the agreed-upon amount from the
sale with the end customer and is, therefore, determined to be acting as agent on behalf of the Company. The principal versus agent consideration
will continue to be assessed for new contracts, both within and outside the company s normal operating activities. 

Income Taxes A
limited liability company is not subject to the payment of federal income taxes as components of its income and expenses flow through
directly to the members. However, the Company is subject to certain state income taxes. Texas margin tax applies to legal entities conducting
business in Texas. The margin tax is based on our Texas sourced taxable margin. The tax is calculated by applying a tax rate to a base
that considers both revenue and expenses and therefore has the characteristics of an income tax. Taxable Subsidiaries may generate income
tax expense because of the Taxable Subsidiaries ownership of the portfolio companies. We reflect any such income tax expense on
our Statements of Operations. The Company had no federal income tax expense for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and September
30, 2023, respectively.

 Table of Contents 

Asset Retirement Obligations The
fair value of asset retirement obligations are recorded in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
can be made, and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The fair value
of the asset retirement obligation is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Company s credit- adjusted
risk-free interest rate. Fair value, to the extent possible, should include a market risk premium for unforeseeable circumstances. No
market risk premium was included in the Company s asset retirement obligation fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could
not be made. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depleted or amortized over the
estimated recoverable reserves using the units-of-production method. 

(9) Morgan
E P, LLC 

 Morgan E P, LLC Morgan was organized by the Fund on April 3, 2023 as a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund. On May 22,
2023, Morgan completed the acquisition of 4,747.52 net acres, in the Bakken/Three Forks formation in the Williston Basin of North Dakota,
and acquired approximately 1,100 additional acres on September 26, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, Morgan acquired an additional
810 net acres proximate to its existing holdings. All of these holdings were acquired from Pro Energy I, LLC Pro Energy ),
an experienced developer of oil and gas properties in the region. 

Under the terms of the Purchase
and Sale Agreement entered into by Morgan and Pro Energy, Morgan is required to drill and complete a minimum of six wells within 18 months
of receiving the first drilling permits. The average cost of drilling a new horizontal well is approximately 8.2 million. During the
fourth quarter of 2023, Morgan sold certain of its wellbore interest in its initial 2 wells to a third party for 5.6 million in cash
in exchange for a net revenue interest of approximately 27 in these wells. With the exception of these initial two wells and the 27 
net revenue interest sold to a third party, Morgan will receive an average net revenue interest NRI of 80 in the production
of future wells drilled, and after operating expenses are deducted from the NRI, Pro Energy shall receive a carried interest for 20 of
these net cash flows. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, in addition to the increase in acreage noted above, Morgan also experienced an increase in proved reserves and probable reserves,
largely due to the commencement of production of its initial two wells that were drilled and completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

In May 2023, we entered into an agreement with Morgan
to provide it up to 10.0 million in senior debt financing, subject to a schedule of disbursements and draws that we determine. In February
2024, we increased the total amount of the facility to 10.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, the facility had been fully-drawn. 

Going-Concern The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Morgan have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the near-term sale of quantities of oil and gas, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the
normal course of business. As such, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amount, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result
should Morgan be unable to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, Morgan does not have sufficient cash resources to fund
its present operations. Morgan is presently seeking external financing to enable it to continue operations over the twelve months from
the date of this quarterly report, but we cannot assure you that Morgan will be successful in doing so, or that such endeavors will generate
sufficient liquidity to enable Morgan to continue operations over the next twelve months. These factors raise substantial doubt about
Morgan s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We do not consolidate the financial
results of Morgan with the financial results of the Fund and, accordingly, only the value of our investment in Morgan is included on our
balance sheets. Our investment in Morgan is valued in accordance with our normal valuation procedures and is based in part on a reserve
report prepared for Morgan by Cawley, Gillespie, Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum engineering firm, the transactions and
values of comparable companies in this sector, and the estimated value of leasehold mineral interests associated with the acreage held
by Morgan. A valuation of Morgan was performed by a third-party valuation firm, who recommended a value range of Morgan consistent with
the fair value determined by our Management (See Schedule of Investments). 

Below is summarized
unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for Morgan E P, LLC as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period from inception (April 3, 2023)
through September 30, 2023, respectively, (in thousands):

Critical Accounting Policies for Morgan 

Acquisitions Morgan
evaluates each acquisition of oil and gas properties to determine whether each should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or
business in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01: Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a
Business ASU 2017-01 ). 

Asset acquisitions are recorded
at the cost of acquiring the property. The results of operations of the oil and gas properties acquired in the Company s acquisitions
have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the closing dates of the respective acquisitions. A business combination
may result in the recognition of a bargain purchase gain or goodwill based on the measurement of the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired at the acquisition date as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred, adjusted for purchase price adjustments.
The initial accounting for business combinations may not be complete and adjustments to provisional amounts, or recognition of additional
assets acquired or liabilities assumed, may occur as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information is obtained about
the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates. 

Oil Gas Properties The
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched
with revenue and expenses. Morgan uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method,
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and natural gas properties
are capitalized. 

Oil and gas properties include
costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unproved
properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration
costs. The Company excludes these costs until the project is evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined.
Excluded costs are reviewed at least annually to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any evaluated or impaired oil and
natural gas properties is transferred to capitalized costs being amortized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
transferred 1.5 million to the full cost pool. 

Oil and natural gas properties
are depleted using the units-of-production method. The depletion expense is significantly affected by the unamortized historical and future
development costs and the estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. Estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves relies on professional
judgment and the use of factors that cannot be precisely determined. Holding all other factors constant, if proved oil and natural gas
reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Subsequent proved reserve estimates that
are materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period. Proceeds
from the sales or disposition of oil and natural gas of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized
costs with no gain or loss recognized, unless such reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves, in which case the gain or loss is recognized in the statement of income. In general, a significant alteration occurs
when the deferral of gains or losses will result in an amortization rate materially different from the amortization rate calculated upon
recognition of gains or losses. Abandonments of properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized. 

Under the full cost accounting
rules, total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenue, discounted at 10 per annum,
plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties less income tax effects (the ceiling limitation ). Future
net revenue used to calculate the ceiling do not include cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations. Morgan performs
an annual ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of the full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation. If capitalized costs
(net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization) are greater than the discounted future net revenue or ceiling limitation,
a write-down or impairment of the full cost pool is required. A write-down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non-cash charge
that reduces earnings and impacts members equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation, depletion,
and amortization expense in future periods. Once incurred, a write-down is not reversible at a later date. The risk that Morgan will be
required to write-down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases during a period when oil or gas prices are depressed.
In addition, a write-down may occur if estimates of proved reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs
increase significantly.

Income Taxes A limited
liability company is not subject to the payment of federal income taxes as components of its income and expenses flow through directly
to the members. However, Morgan may be subject to certain state income taxes, inasmuch as it maintains a registered office in Texas. Texas
margin tax applies to legal entities conducting business in Texas. The margin tax is based on our Texas sourced taxable margin. The tax
is calculated by applying a tax rate to a base that considers both revenue and expenses and therefore has the characteristics of an income
tax. Taxable Subsidiaries may generate income tax expense because of the Taxable Subsidiaries ownership of the portfolio companies.
We reflect any such income tax expense on our Statements of Operations. Morgan had no federal income tax expense since inception. 

Asset Retirement Obligations The
fair value of asset retirement obligations are recorded in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
can be made, and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The fair value
of the asset retirement obligation is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at Morgan s credit- adjusted risk-free
interest rate. Fair value, to the extent possible, should include a market risk premium for unforeseeable circumstances. No market risk
premium was included in Morgan s asset retirement obligation fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could not be made.
The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depleted or amortized over the estimated
recoverable reserves using the units-of-production method. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability,
the Company will record the difference to the full cost pool. 

Environmental Matters 

We do not believe the existence
of current environmental laws or interpretations thereof will materially hinder or adversely affect Morgan s business operations;
however, there can be no assurances of future effects on Morgan of new laws or interpretations thereof. 

Environmental Contingencies 

Morgan s activities are
subject to local, state, and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control in the United States.
The exploration, drilling and production from wells, natural gas facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants
and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating, or storing natural gas and other products, are subject to stringent environmental
regulation by state and federal authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency EPA ). Such regulation can increase
the cost of planning, designing, installing, and operating such facilities.

include statements as to: 

our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our existing and prospective portfolio companies; 

the return or impact of current and future investments; 

our contractual arrangements and other relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the financial condition and ability of our existing and prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financings and investments; 

our regulatory structure and tax treatment; 

our ability to qualify and operate as a BDC and a RIC, including the impact of changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, or the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our business; 

the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market;

Report, please see the discussion in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors , and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 10-K ). In particular, you should carefully
consider the risks we have described in the 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report concerning our efforts to transform Equus into
an operating company, as well as the coronavirus pandemic and the economic impact of the coronavirus on the Fund and our sole remaining
portfolio company, as well as on oil and gas markets generally. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date this Quarterly
Report is filed with the SEC. 

 We attempt to
maximize the return to stockholders in the form of current investment income and long-term capital gains by investing in the debt and
equity securities of companies with a total enterprise value of between 5.0 million and 75.0 million, although we may engage in transactions
with smaller or larger investee companies from time to time. We seek to invest primarily in companies pursuing growth either through acquisition
or organically, leveraged buyouts, management buyouts and recapitalizations of existing businesses or special situations. Our income-producing
investments consist principally of debt securities including subordinate debt, debt convertible into common or preferred stock, or debt
combined with warrants and common and preferred stock. Debt and preferred equity financing may also be used to create long- term capital
appreciation through the exercise and sale of warrants received in connection with the financing. To the extent that we remain a BDC,
we will seek to achieve capital appreciation by making investments in equity and equity-oriented securities issued by privately-owned
companies (and smaller public companies) in transactions negotiated directly with such companies. Given market conditions over the past
several years and the performance of our portfolio, our management and Board of Directors believe it is prudent to continue to review
alternatives to refine and further clarify the current strategies. 

 We elected to be treated
as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We currently qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not required to pay corporate
income taxes on any income or gains that we distribute to our stockholders. We have a wholly-owned Taxable Subsidiary which holds one
of our portfolio investments listed on our Schedules of Investments. The purpose of this Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain
income-producing investments or portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs, (or other forms of pass-through
entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90 of our gross revenue for income tax purposes must consist of investment
income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a portion of the gross income of these income- producing investments or of any LLC (or other pass-through
entity) portfolio investment, as the case may be, would flow through directly to us for the 90 test. To the extent that such income did
not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and, therefore, cause us to incur significant federal
income taxes. The income of the LLCs (or other pass-through entities) owned by Taxable Subsidiary is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and
does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant tax advantages. We do not consolidate the Taxable
Subsidiary for income tax purposes and they may generate income tax expense because of the Taxable Subsidiary s ownership of the
portfolio investment. We reflect any such income tax expense on our Statements of Operations.

Conversion to an Operating Company 

Authorization to Withdraw
BDC Election . In previous years, holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Fund approved our cessation as a BDC
under the 1940 Act and authorized our Board to cause the Fund s withdrawal of its election to be classified as a BDC, effective
as of a date designated by the Board and our Chief Executive Officer. Although this authorization has since expired, we expect to receive
a further authorization from our shareholders later in 2024 or in 2025 as a consequence of our expressed intent to transform Equus into
an operating company. Notwithstanding any such authorization to withdraw our BDC election, we will not submit any such withdrawal unless
and until Equus has entered into a definitive agreement to effect a transformative transaction. Further, even if we are again authorized
to withdraw our election as a BDC, we will require a subsequent affirmative vote from holders of a majority of our outstanding voting
shares to enter into any such definitive agreement or change the nature of our business. While we are presently evaluating various opportunities
that could enable us to accomplish this transformation, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so within any particular time
period or at all, and, although we expect that our shareholders will grant a further authorization, we do not expect to cause the Fund
to withdraw its election to be classified as BDC prior to December 31, 2024. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the terms of any such
transformative transaction would be acceptable to us. 

Reduction in Asset Coverage Ratio 

On November
14, 2019, our shareholders approved a reduction in our asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 . Prior to the reduction, we were restricted
in the amount that we could borrow to the value of our net assets. The reduction in our asset coverage from 200 to 150 means that we
may now borrow up to twice the value of our net assets. Except for a margin loan that we have previously procured each quarter to acquire
U.S. Treasury bills as part of the maintenance of our RIC status, we have not incurred any additional borrowings as a consequence of this
authorization. 

2016 Equity Incentive Plan 

On June 13, 2016, our
shareholders approved the adoption of our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan Incentive Plan ). On January 10, 2017, the SEC issued
an order approving the Incentive Plan and certain awards intended to be made thereunder. The Incentive Plan is intended to promote the
interests of the Fund by encouraging officers, employees, and directors of the Fund and its affiliates to acquire or increase their equity
interest in the Fund and to provide a means whereby they may develop a proprietary interest in the development and financial success of
the Fund, to encourage them to remain with and devote their best efforts to the business of the Fund, thereby advancing the interests
of the Fund and its stockholders. The Incentive Plan is also intended to enhance the ability of the Fund and its affiliates to attract
and retain the services of individuals who are essential for the growth and profitability of the Fund. The Incentive Plan permits the
award of restricted stock as well as common stock purchase options. The maximum number of shares of common stock that are subject to awards
granted under the Incentive Plan is 2,434,728 shares. The term of the Incentive Plan will expire on June 13, 2026. On March 17, 2017,
we granted awards of restricted stock under the Plan to certain of our directors and executive officers in the aggregate amount of 844,500
shares. The awards were each subject to a vesting requirement over a 3-year period unless
the recipient thereof wa s terminated or removed from their position as a director or executive
officer without cause , or as a result of constructive termination, as such terms are defined in the respective award agreements
entered into by each of the recipients and the Fund. As of June 30, 2020, all awards granted under the Incentive Plan were fully vested.
We account for share-based compensation using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718. Accordingly, for restricted stock awards,
we measure the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and amortize the fair value
of the awards as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term.

Current Market Conditions 

Impact of Economic
and Geopolitical Events on the Oil and Gas Sector. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, crude prices began a steady decline following
increases that were largely due to increased post-Covid demand and the buildup and subsequent invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. Prices
began to rise and fall in successive quarters between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024, and stood at 68.27 as
of September 30, 2024. Natural gas prices experienced high volatility in 2022 before collapsing in 2023 and have thereafter remained generally
stable, finishing the first nine months of 2024 at 2.92 per MMBTU. Relative oil price stability has been a significant factor in increased
consolidation activity in the Permian Basin where Equus Energy holds most of its development rights, as well as in the Williston Basin
region in North Dakota where Morgan holds its development rights. On October 8, 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration issued
estimates of 79.91 and 73.13 for the average WTI price per barrel of oil for the years 2024 and 2025, respectively, and estimated average
gas prices of 2.30 and 3.10 for 2024 and 2025, respectively. 

Operators of the leasehold
interests held by Equus Energy have not yet undertaken significant capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect upon
the operations and long-term financial condition of Equus Energy. To conserve existing cash resources or create additional cash resources
during the next year, Equus Energy intends to either: (i) attempt to secure equity or debt financing from one or more institutional sources,
which sources may include the Fund, a commercial lender, or other investors, (ii) request that its operators shut-in additional wells,
(iii) sell certain of its oil and gas holdings, or (iv) undertake a combination of the foregoing. However, we cannot assure you that Equus
Energy will be able to implement these plans successfully, or that such plans will generate sufficient liquidity to fund the operating
expenses of Equus Energy over the next twelve-months. 

Morgan has undertaken significant capital
expenditures for oil and gas development during the third and fourth quarters of 2023. During 2024, Morgan undertook an additional
 6.4 million in capital expenditures, principally consisting of accruals and additional costs related to the development of its initial
two wells. The company is expected to incur additional capital expenditures related to drilling and completion of additional wells
in 2025. 

 The U.S. Economy .
U.S. GDP increased at an annualized rate of 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024, below consensus estimates of 3.0 for the period. This
followed increases of 3.0 and 1.4 on an annualized basis for the second and first quarters of 2024. The principal drivers of the increase
during the third quarter of 2024 were increased consumer and government spending. The Conference Board is projecting an increase in GDP
of 2.6 for all of 2024, slowing to 1.7 for 2025. Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis; The Conference Board ). 

Employment and
Housing . The U.S. added only 12,000 new jobs in October 2024, but the overall unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 , offsetting concerns
of a pending recession. The Congressional Budget Office is predicting no change in the unemployment rate through 2025. Persistently high
borrowing costs have constrained sales volumes of existing and new homes during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 to their lowest
levels in decades, although home prices continue to increase and have outpaced inflation. Recent releases of neutral economic data has
resulted in continued high mortgage rates, suggesting that acquisition and refinancing activity for 30-year mortgages will not increase
until later in 2025 Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Freddie Mac ). 

Consumer Prices .
After experiencing substantial increases in 2022 and into 2023, consumer price increases have significantly ebbed. As of September 30,
2024, the consumer price index was up 2.1 over the previous 12-month period, down from 2.3 in August 2024, and at a three-year low.
Largely as a result of slowing of economic growth, most commentators are forecasting a decrease in the rate of inflation throughout the
remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Bureau of Labor Statistics; Trading Economics ). 

Interest Rates .
Principally as a response to declining rates of GDP growth and inflation, on September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates
for the first time in four years, decreasing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, and indicated that further cuts may be on the
horizon. With decreases in the consumer price index and increases in the U.S. unemployment rate, most analysts are expecting further cuts
in late 2024 or at the Federal Open Market Committee s meetings in January or March 2025. Sources: Forbes; The Federal Reserve
Board ). 

Mergers and Acquisitions .
During the third quarter of 2024, global merger and acquisition activity increased significantly to 160 billion as compared to 76 billion
during the second quarter of 2024, although the number of transactions in each quarter remained relatively consistent at approximately
1,600. Some industry commentators are predicting that consolidations and divestitures will continue to increase, particularly in the areas
of healthcare, technology, and energy. Higher interest rates and lower deal volumes have kept valuation multiples at levels consistent
with previous years, which is expected to facilitate increased transaction activity through the remainder of the year and into 2025. Sources:
Ernst Young; S P Global ).

Private Equity .
Private equity activity, both in the U.S. and globally, slowed in 2022 and 2023 following the frenetic pace of 2020 and 2021. While the
first half of 2024 showed a significant increase compared to the first half of 2023, the third quarter of 2024 finished flat, and analysts
are expecting overall PE activity to be similar to that of 2023. Industry analysts are also predicting artificial intelligence driven
enterprises will top the list of acquisition priorities, along with energy infrastructure plays that benefit from federal incentives. Sources: Statista; S P Global; Ropes Gray ). 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, our net asset value decreased from 3.55 per share to 2.96 per share, a decrease of 16.6 . As of September
30, 2024, our common stock is trading at a 54.1 discount to our net asset value as compared to 59.2 as of December 31, 2023. 

Over the past several
years, we have executed certain initiatives to enhance liquidity, achieve a lower operational cost structure, provide more assistance
to portfolio companies and realize certain of our portfolio investments. Specifically, we changed the composition of our Board of Directors
and Management, terminated certain of our follow-on investments, internalized the management of the Fund, suspended our managed distribution
policy, modified our investment strategy to pursue shorter term liquidation opportunities, pursued non-cash investment opportunities,
and sold certain of our legacy and underperforming investment holdings. We believe these actions continue to be necessary to protect capital
and liquidity in order to preserve and enhance shareholder value. Because our Management is internalized, certain of our expenses should
not increase commensurate with an increase in the size of the Fund and, therefore, to the extent we remain a BDC, we expect to achieve
efficiencies in our cost structure if we are able to grow the Fund. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We generate cash primarily
from maturities, sales of securities and borrowings, as well as capital gains realized upon the sale of portfolio investments. We use
cash primarily to make additional investments, either in new companies or as follow-on investments in the existing portfolio companies
and to pay the dividends to our stockholders. 

Because of the nature
and size of the portfolio investments, we may periodically borrow funds to make qualifying investments to maintain our tax status as a
RIC. We often borrow such funds by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm. There is no assurance that such arrangement
will be available in the future. If we are unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments,
 Equus may no longer qualify as a RIC. The Fund would then be subject to corporate income tax
on its net investment income and realized capital gains, and distributions to stockholders would be subject to income tax as ordinary
dividends. 

The Fund has the ability
to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock, such as preferred stock, subject to certain restrictions.
Net taxable investment income and net taxable realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at
least annually, to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make follow-on or new investments. 

We reserve the right
to retain net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses.
Such retained amounts, if any, will be taxable to the Fund as long-term capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate
share of the federal income taxes paid on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities. Stockholders will also
be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their Fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their
tax credit. 

We are evaluating
the impact of current market conditions on our portfolio company valuations and their ability to provide current income. We believe we
have followed valuation techniques in a reasonably consistent manner; however, we are cognizant of current market conditions that might
affect future valuations of portfolio securities. 

It is possible the
Fund will require loans, capital investment from one or more sources, or will be required to dispose of certain of its investments, to
cover a potential cash shortfall. The Fund does not presently have any existing commitments to fund any such shortfall, should it occur,
and cannot guarantee that it will be able to execute on such plans in the future.

Results of Operations 

Investment Income and Expense 

Net investment loss
was relatively unchanged at 0.7 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 2.7
million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Total investment
income was 0.3 million and 0.04 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.9 million and
 0.06 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the nine months is due to the
interest-bearing portfolio investment. 

Compensation expense
was 0.4 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.3 million and 1.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is a result of bonuses paid in 2023. 

Professional
fees were relatively unchanged at 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and were 1.2
million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was principally due to
overall fee increases in legal and accounting fees. 

General and administrative
expenses were 0.04 million and 0.03 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 0.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Changes in Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation of Portfolio Securities 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we made a 2.2 million follow-on debt investment in Morgan E P, LLC Morgan ). During
this period, we also recorded a decrease of 3.6 million in the fair value of our equity holding in Morgan. The decrease was primarily
due to declines in oil prices, as well as declines in production during the period. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, with respect to our holding in Equus Energy, LLC, we recorded a decrease of 2.0 million in the fair value of
our investment. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in oil prices during the period. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, we made a 2.4 million debt investment in Morgan E P, LLC Morgan and also invested 1.00
in the equity of Morgan. We recorded a change in fair value of the equity of Morgan of 15.0 million. The increase was principally due
to a significant increase in Morgan s acreage rights and associated reserves, an increase in oil and gas prices, and our expectation
of Morgan generating operating cash flow from recent drilling activity in the near future in the Bakken shale region where it holds leasehold
acreage rights. 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, with respect to our holding in Equus Energy, LLC, we recorded no change in the fair value of this
investment. 

Dividends 

We will pay out net
investment income and/or realized capital gains, if any, on an annual basis as required under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

Subsequent Event s 

Management performed
an evaluation of the Fund s activity through the date the financial statements were issued, noting the following subsequent events: 

In October 2024, our
holding in 55.0 million in U.S. Treasury Bills matured and we repaid our margin loan.

 Table of Contents 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 

We are subject to
financial market risks, including changes in interest rates with respect to investments in debt securities and outstanding debt payable,
as well as changes in marketable equity security prices. In the future, we may invest in companies outside the United States, including
in Europe and Asia, which would give rise to exposure to foreign currency value fluctuations. We do not use derivative financial instruments
to mitigate any of these risks. The return on investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations. 

Our investments in
portfolio securities consist of some fixed-rate debt securities. Since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate, changes
in interest rates do not directly affect interest income. We determine
their fair values based on the terms of the relevant debt security and the financial condition of the issuer. 

A major portion of
our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies. Modest changes in public market equity prices generally
do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments. However, significant changes in market equity prices can have
a longer-term effect on valuations of private companies, which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses
realized on these investments. A small portion of the investment portfolio could also consist of common stock in publicly traded companies.
These investments are directly exposed to equity price risk, in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result
in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, with
the participation of our Fund s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operations of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting described below. 

44 

 Table of Contents 

Material Weakness in Internal Control
over Financing Reporting Existing as September 30, 2024 

A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

Management concluded
that the previously disclosed material weakness relating to the Fund s controls relating to the design and operation of management
review over the valuation of the Fund s portfolio investment, including management s review procedures over the completeness
and accuracy of the underlying data and information supplied to third parties assisting management by recommending a range of reasonable
fair values continued to exist as of September 30, 2024. 

Although this material
weakness did not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods then presented, there is a
possibility that, had the material weakness continued undetected, it could have led to a material misstatement of portfolio fair values
and related disclosures. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. 

Management believes
that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects the Fund s
financial condition, results of its operations, changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the periods presented. We believe that
the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are accurate. 

We have begun the process
of, and we are focused on, enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and
remediate the material weaknesses. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following: 

Enhancing existing controls that address the completeness and accuracy of underlying data and information supplied to third parties assisting management in its determination of fair value and in the performance of management review controls over the valuation of the Fund s portfolio securities; and 

Enhancing policies and procedures to improve the precision of review and evidence of review procedures performed to demonstrate effective design and operation of such controls. 

We believe our planned
actions to enhance our processes and controls will address the material weakness, but these actions are subject to ongoing management
evaluation, and we will need a period of execution to demonstrate remediation. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal
control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. 

There were no other
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

 From time to time,
the Fund is a party to certain proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under
contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty,
we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon the Fund s financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In connection with
our efforts to convert Equus into an operating company in furtherance of our plan to convert the Fund into an operating company, we may
be subject to a number of risks associated with this process, the transactions that would embody a consolidation of Equus with another
company, as well as specific risks associated with the commercial enterprise with which Equus may seek to combine itself. We intend to
identify, as will be reasonably possible, such risks and include the same in our subsequent filings and reports with the SEC . 

Readers should carefully
consider these risks and all other information contained in our annual report on Form 10-K 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, including the Fund s financial statements and the related notes thereto. The risks and uncertainties described in our
10-K and throughout this 10-Q are not the only ones facing the Fund. 

Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance.
