 The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by International Paper do Brasil Ltda., now named Sylvamo do Brasil Ltda. Sylvamo Brasil ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Brazil Tax Dispute ). Sylvamo Brasil received assessments for the tax years 2007-2015 totaling approximately million in tax, and million in interest, penalties and fees as of September 30, 2024 (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates and a law change pursuant to which the Brazil tax authority agreed to cancel a portion of the interest, penalties, and fees). International Paper challenged and is managing the litigation of this matter pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement between us and International Paper. After a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments, there were subsequent unfavorable decisions from the Brazilian Administrative Council of Tax Appeals. On behalf of Sylvamo Brasil, International Paper has appealed and at present, has advised us that it intends to further appeal these and any future unfavorable administrative judgments to the Brazilian federal courts. On October 11, 2024, the Brazilian federal regional court issued a favorable ruling to Sylvamo Brasil in the first stage of judicial review. This ruling, however, is subject to appeal by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service. This tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve. We believe the transaction underlying these assessments was appropriately evaluated, and that Sylvamo Brasil's tax position should be sustained, based on Brazilian tax law. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, International Paper will pay , and Sylvamo will pay on up to million of any assessment related to this matter, and International Paper will pay all amounts of the assessment over million. Also in connection with this agreement, all decisions concerning the conduct of the litigation related to this matter, including settlement strategy, pursuit and abandonment, will continue to be made by International Paper, which is vigorously defending Sylvamo Brasil s historic tax position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015.

million (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) regarding unpaid VAT arising from intercompany transactions. This assessment includes million in tax and million in interest and penalties. As of September 30, 2024, reserve has been recorded by the Company because the risk of loss is not probable. 
 
 The Company reached an amnesty agreement with the Brazilian government related to certain VAT amounts assessed in prior years, which are unrelated to the 2024 tax assessment noted above. This agreement resulted in the recognition of million of interest income during the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 We have other open tax matters awaiting resolution in Brazil, which are at various stages of review in various administrative and judicial proceedings. We routinely assess these tax matters for materiality and probability of loss or gain, and appropriate amounts have been recorded in our financial statements for any open items where the risk of loss is deemed probable. We currently do not consider any of these other tax matters to be material individually. However, it is reasonably possible that settlement of any of these matters concurrently could result in a material loss or that over time a matter could become material, for example, if interest were accruing on the amount at issue for a significant period of time. Also, future exchange rate fluctuations could be unfavorable to the U.S. dollar and significant enough to cause an open matter to become material. The expected timing for resolution of these open matters ranges from to . 
 
 General 
 
 The Company is involved in various other inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation relating to environmental and safety matters, taxes (including VAT), personal injury, product liability, labor and employment, contracts, sales of property and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, can rely heavily on estimates and assu mptions, and are otherwise subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, there can be no certainty that the Company will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. The Company believes that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein, will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company. However, in light of

 In addition to the debt noted above, the Company has the ability to access a cash flow-based revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility ). As a part of the refinancing in the third quarter of 2024, the company amended the existing Revolving Credit Facility agreement which reduced the total borrowing capacity to million and extended the maturity to 2029. In addition, the Company entered into a separate bilateral letter of credit facility and subsequently transferred all existing letters of credit to the new facility, eliminating the impact to the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and an available borrowing capacity of million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and million of letters of credit related to the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of million.

 Sylvamo North America LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, maintains a million accounts receivable finance facility (the Securitization Program ), maturing in 2027 as amended during the debt refinancing in the third quarter. The Company sells substantially all of its North American accounts receivable balances to Sylvamo Receivables, LLC, a special purpose entity, which pledges the receivables as collateral for the Securitization Program. The borrowing availability under this facility is limited by the balance of eligible receivables within the program. The average interest rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was , and the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was . 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, in connection with the tender offer and the consent solicitation related to the 2029 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a new senior secured term loan facility amendment which provided an aggregate principal amount of million Term Loan A ). Term Loan A, together with million borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, were used to pay the total consideration for all notes tendered in the tender offer, plus accrued interest and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation. Upon close in the first quarter of 2023, million aggregate principal of the notes were tendered, resulting in a debt extinguishment cost of million, related to the write-off of debt issuance costs. This cost was recorded within Interest expense (income), net. As part of the refinancing in the third quarter of 2024, the agreement for Term Loan A was amended to extend the maturity date to 2029.

million Term Loan F-2 maturing in 2031. A portion of the proceeds from Term Loan F-2 were used to repay million of Term Loan F and million of Term Loan A. The Company used the remaining proceeds to redeem the million outstanding principal of our 2029 Senior Notes and to pay related premiums and fees. Debt extinguishment costs for the refinancing include million of premiums paid related to the 2029 Senior Notes redemption and million of deferred financing costs which were written off. This cost was recorded within Interest expense (income), net. In connection with the debt refinancing, we incurred million of debt issuance costs to be amortized over each instrument s term until maturity. 
 
 The interest rates applicable to the Term Loan F, Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to SOFR plus a fixed percentage of , and , respectively, payable monthly, with a SOFR floor of . Term Loan F-2 is based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to SOFR plus a fixed percent of , payable monthly, with a SOFR floor of . The obligations under the Term Loan F, Term Loan A, Term Loan F-2, and Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of Sylvamo and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and are guaranteed by Sylvamo and certain subsidiaries. 
 
 We are receiving interest patronage credits under the Term Loan F and Term Loan F-2. Patronage distributions, which are made primarily in cash but also in equity in the lenders, are generally received in the first quarter of the year following that in which they were earned. Expected patronage credits are accrued in accounts and notes receivable as a reduction to interest expense in the period earned. After giving effect to expected patronage distributions of basis points, of which basis points is expected as a cash rebate, the effective net interest rate on the Term Loan F was approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the effective net interest rate on the Term Loan F-2 was approximately as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the Term Loan F, the Company was party to interest rate swaps with various counterparties with a notional amount of million maturing in 2024 and million maturing in 2026. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company received cash proceeds of million from the unwind of interest rate swaps maturing in 2024 with a total notional amount of million. In addition, the Company liquidated the swaps maturing in 2026 with a notional amount of million in the third quarter of 2023, receiving cash proceeds of million. The related gains from all swap proceeds have been deferred within Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized into interest expense over the original contract term of the swaps, of which less than one year is remaining for the swaps originally maturing in 2024 and two years is remaining for the swaps originally maturing in 2026. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company entered into new interest rate swaps with various counterparties with a notional amount of million, maturing in 2025. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, and are utilized to manage interest rate risk. The interest rate swaps allow for the Company to exchange the difference in the variable rates on Term Loan F determined in reference to SOFR and the fixed interest rate per notional amount ranging from to .

 The limit on restricted payments that we may make prior to the resolution of the Brazil Tax Dispute is million if our pro-forma consolidated leverage ratio is less than to 1.00 and greater than or equal to to 1.00, or million if the pro-forma consolidated leverage ratio is less than to 1.00. However, limitations imposed on restricted payments are eliminated prior to the final settlement of the Brazil Tax Dispute if (i) we deposit million in an account subject to the control of the administrative agent under our credit agreement, or (ii) we deposit million in such an account and maintain million of available liquidity at the time we make restricted payments. The funds deposited in the account would be used to pay the Company s share of the settlement of the Brazil Tax Dispute, with any excess funds returned to us if our portion of any final settlement amount is less than the amount on deposit. In 2023, the Company deposited million in an account subject to the control of the administrative agent. Therefore, our ability to make restricted payments under the credit agreement is governed by the provisions in the credit agreement in effect as if the Brazil Tax Dispute is settled, if at the time of any restricted payments we maintain million of available liquidity. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Financial Information of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q and the Company s Form 10-K for the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated and implied in any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Form 10-K, particularly under the headings Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements . 
 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Third quarter 2024 net income was 95 million 2.27 per diluted share) compared with 83 million 1.98 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2024. Net sales were 965 million in the current quarter compared with 933 million in the prior quarter. Cash from operations was 163 million compared to 115 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 193 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 20 compared to 164 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18 . Free cash flow was 119 million compared to 62 million in the second quarter. 
 
 Comparing our performance in the third quarter to the second quarter, price and mix was unfavorable, primarily driven by North American mix, while volume increased in North America. Operations and costs were stable reflecting solid operations across our mills in all three regions. Planned maintenance outage expenses decreased significantly as we had no major planned outages during the third quarter. Input and transportation costs increased slightly, as higher fiber costs in Latin America more than offset lower energy and transportation costs in North America. 
 
 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect price and mix to be unfavorable due to pulp and paper price decreases in Europe, higher export mix in Latin America and unfavorable customer mix in North America. Volume is expected to improve driven by Latin America. Operations and costs are expected to increase slightly due to expenses for a planned ten-year turbine generator maintenance event at our Eastover mill that will be partially offset by better fixed cost absorption from less economic downtime in North America. Additionally, we expect input and transportation costs to be higher mostly due to transportation and seasonally higher energy costs. Lastly, we expect planned maintenance outage costs to increase due to the planned outage at Eastover during the fourth quarter. 
 
 Georgetown Mill Supply Agreement 
 
 On October 30, 2024, the Company and International Paper entered into an agreement to terminate the Georgetown mill supply agreement effective December 31, 2024. International Paper also announced plans to discontinue operations at the Georgetown mill. We expect the Georgetown mill to supply us with approximately 250,000 tons of uncoated freesheet and bristols during 2024. We plan to transition production of approximately 100,000 tons annually, of the most profitable products, to our Ticonderoga and Eastover mills. We will exit approximately 150,000 tons annually. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 
 
 Overview 
 Management provides business segment operating profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that business segment operating profit provides investors and analysts useful insights into our operating performance. Business segment operating profit is reconciled to Income before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Business segment operating profit may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.

 (a) We define business segment operating profit as our income before income taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding net interest expense (income) and net special items. We believe that business segment operating profit is an important indicator of operating performance as it is a measure reported to our management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to our business segments and assessing the performance of our business segments. 
 
 (b) Special items represent income or expenses that are incurred periodically, rather than on a regular basis. Net special items in the periods presented primarily include legal fees related to the Brazil Tax Dispute, a loss related to forest fires in Brazil, certain severance costs related to our salaried workforce, integration costs related to the Nym lla acquisition, professional and legal fees related to negotiations resulting in a shareholder cooperation agreement, the impact of the step-up of acquired Nym lla inventory sold during the first quarter of 2023 and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management provides Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement our GAAP financial information, and it should be considered in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses this measure in managing the operating performance of our business and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and analysts meaningful insights into our operating performance and is a relevant metric for the third-party debt. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net Income 95 58 221 204 Income tax provision 37 33 84 98 Interest (income) expense, net 14 9 32 28 Depreciation, amortization and cost of timber harvested 39 36 115 105 Stock-based compensation 5 6 17 21 Net special items expense (income) (a)

 (a) Special items represent income or expenses that are incurred periodically, rather than on a regular basis. Net special items in the periods presented primarily include legal fees related to the Brazil Tax Dispute, certain severance costs related to our salaried workforce, integration costs related to the Nym lla acquisition, professional and legal fees related to negotiations resulting in a shareholder cooperation agreement, the impact of the step-up of acquired Nym lla inventory sold during the first quarter of 2023 and other charges. 
 (b) We define Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) as net income (GAAP), net of taxes plus the sum of income taxes, net interest expense (income), depreciation, amortization and cost of timber harvested, stock-based compensation, and, when applicable for the periods reported, special items. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operating activities. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet and service debt, and return cash to shareowners. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. By adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the Company s ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods. 
 The following is a reconciliation of Cash provided by operations to Free Cash Flow: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, In millions 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 163 197 305 337 Adjustments: Cash invested in capital projects (44) (42) (157) (147) Free Cash Flow 119 155 148 190 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-Q as referenced above have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies utilize identical calculations, the Company s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-Q may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as the Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our ability to fund the Company s cash needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and obtain financing on acceptable terms. Based upon our history of generating strong operating cash flow, we believe we will be able to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We believe we will meet known or reasonably likely future cash requirements through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and available borrowings through the issuance of third-party debt, as needed. 
 
 A major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. While changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw materials, energy, mill outages and distribution expenses do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to manage costs and working capital, will provide sufficient cash flow generation to meet our operational and capital spending needs. 
 
 The terms of the agreements governing our debt contain customary limitations for the financing as well as other provisions. These provisions may also restrict our business and, in the event we cannot meet the terms of those provisions, may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 305 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash provided by operating activities of 337 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 relates primarily to timing of cash flows related to working capital. 
 
 Cash used for working capital components (accounts and notes receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other) was 44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash provided by working capital components of 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 working capital components primarily reflect 28 million, 21 million and 11 million of cash used for our accounts and notes receivables, inventories and other operating activities, respectively, offset by 16 million of cash provided by our accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 working capital components primarily reflect 99 million and 72 million of cash provided by our accounts and notes receivable and other operating activities, respectively, offset by 46 million and 122 million of cash used for our inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances, respectively. 
 
 Investment Activities 
 
 The total cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the purchase of the Nym lla mill which occurred in the prior year. 
 
 The following table shows capital spending by business segment:

 2024 2023 Europe 
 17 24 Latin America 102 77 North America 
 37 42 Corporate 1 4 Total 
 157 147 
 
 Capital spending primarily consists of purchases of machinery and equipment related to our global mill operations and reforestation and timber purchase costs in Latin America. 
 
 23 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects the payments of 117 million, 44 million, 23 million, and 10 million on our outstanding principal debt balances for Term Loan F, Term Loan A, the AR Securitization, and Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. Additionally, payments of 93 million were made to redeem, at a premium, the full value of our 7.00 Senior Notes and pay 5 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the debt refinancing in the third quarter. These amounts are primarily offset by the issuance of Term Loan F-2, draws on our Revolving Credit Facility, and AR Securitization of 235 million, 10 million, and 6 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company also paid 43 million in dividends and repurchased 30 million of our shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the payments of 60 million, 34 million, 20 million, and 8 million on our outstanding principal debt balances for the Revolving Credit Facility, AR Securitization, Term Loan F, and Term Loan A, respectively. Additionally, 360 million was paid to bond holders as part of our tender offer. These amounts are primarily offset by the issuance of Term Loan A, draws on our Revolving Credit Facility, and AR Securitization of 300 million, 70 million, and 70 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company also paid 32 million in dividends and repurchased 53 million of our shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our 2023 Form 10-K included disclosures of our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024. We continue to make the contractually required payments, and, therefore, the 2023 obligations and commitments described in our 2023 Form 10-K have been reduced by the required payments. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have invested approximately 157 million, or 5.6 of net sales, in total capital expenditures. Over that period, we spent approximately 140 million, or 5.0 of net sales, in maintenance, regulatory and reforestation capital expenditures, and approximately 17 million, or 0.6 of net sales, in high-return capital projects. Our annual maintenance, regulatory and reforestation capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately 175 to 190 million per year (before inflation) for the next several years, which we believe will be sufficient to maintain our operations and productivity. In addition, we expect to spend approximately 30 million to 35 million on high-return projects in 2024. 

PILLAR TWO DIRECTIVE 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development OECD has been working on a project to act to prevent what it refers to as base erosion and profit shifting BEPS ). Most recently, the OECD, through an association of almost 140 countries known as the inclusive framework, has announced a consensus to address, among other things, perceived challenges presented by global digital commerce Pillar 1 and the perceived need for a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 Pillar 2 ). On December 15, 2022, the European Union formally adopted the Pillar Two Directive, and a majority of EU member states have enacted the directive into domestic law as of December 31, 2023. Other countries are taking similar actions. The Pillar Two Directive has not had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of the Company, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, business combinations and income taxes. 
 The Company has included in the 2023 Form 10-K a discussion of these critical accounting policies, which are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s judgments. The Company has not made any changes in these critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2024.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements forecast or state expectations concerning future events. These statements often can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They typically use words such as anticipate, assume, could, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, should, will and other words and terms of similar meaning, or they are tied to future periods in connection with discussions of the Company s performance. Some examples of forward-looking statements include those relating to our business and operating outlook, future obligations and anticipated expenditures. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be incorrect, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict. 
 
 Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors, the impact of the following factors, among others, on us or on our suppliers or customers, could cause our actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements: deterioration of global and regional economic and political conditions, including the impact of wars and other conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; physical, financial and reputational risks associated with climate change; adverse environmental events, including forest fires on our lands in Brazil; public health crises that could have impacts similar to those experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; increased costs or reduced availability of the raw materials, energy, transportation (truck, rail and ocean) and labor needed to manufacture and deliver our products; reduced demand for our products due to industry-wide declines in demand for paper, the cyclical nature of the paper industry or competition from other businesses; a material disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities; information technology risks including potential cybersecurity breaches affecting us or third parties with which we do business; extensive environmental laws and regulations, as well as tax and other laws, in the United States, Brazil and other jurisdictions to which we are subject, including our compliance costs and risk of violations and liability; our reliance on a small number of customers; a failure by us to attract and retain senior management and other key and skilled employees; loss of our commercial agreements with International Paper; our indebtedness having a material adverse effect on our financial condition, or our inability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness; and the factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors , as such disclosures may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or actual outcomes.

Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase in amounts, at prices and at such times as it deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations, including all applicable legal requirements. Repurchases may include purchases on the open market or privately negotiated transfers, under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, under accelerated share repurchase programs, in tender offers and otherwise. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares of its common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company s discretion. The Company repurchased 30 million of shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
