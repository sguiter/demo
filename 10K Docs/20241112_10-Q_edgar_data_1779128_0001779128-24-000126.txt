 key product lines across segments (see Note 7 for further information on reportable segments): 
 
 Passenger segment 
 
 Short Distance Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe between and miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter basis. Short Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card transactions, wire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services, with the exception of Europe where institutional clients pay after the performance of related services under payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. 
 Jet and Other Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New York and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers and certain ground transportation services. Jet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates and our app and are paid for principally via checks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the time of booking before the performance of the related service. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. 
 Medical segment 
 MediMobility Organ Transport Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the medical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination and support evaluating potential donor organs. MediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased through our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for principally via checks and wires. Payments are generally collected after the performance of the related service in accordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. 
 
 The Company initially records advance payments for passenger flights in deferred revenue, deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs. Deferred revenue from advance payments, customer credit and gift card purchases is recognized as revenue when a flight is flown. Deferred revenue from the Company s passes is recognized ratably over the term of the pass. For travel that has more than one flight segment, the Company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs. Fees charged in association with add-on services, changes or extensions to non-refundable seats sold are considered part of the Company's passenger performance obligation. As such, those fees are deferred at the time of collection and recognized at the time the travel is provided.

 reportable segments - Passenger and Medical, as our Chief Executive Officer, who is our CODM, regularly reviews discrete information for those reportable segments. The Passenger segment consists of our product lines Short Distance and Jet and Other. The Medical segment consists of the MediMobility Organ Transport product line. Our product lines are defined in Note 2 Revenue. 
 
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance to Adjusted EBITDA, as the CODM evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources primarily based on their respective Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the operational efficiency and core results of our segment, independent of tax implications and non-operational financial factors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4) interest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-term investments, (7) impairment of intangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.

 Legal and Environmental 
 From time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. Other than described below, we do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these other litigation and claims will not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition. 
 
 In February 2024, putative class action lawsuits relating to the acquisition of Blade Urban Air Mobility, Inc. Old Blade were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On April 16, 2024, these cases were consolidated under the caption Drulias et al. v. Affeldt, et al., C.A. No. 2024-0161-SG (Del. Ch.) Drulias ). Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the former directors of Experience Investment Corp. EIC and such directors, the EIC Directors ), the former officers of EIC, and Experience Sponsor LLC Sponsor ), and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against Sponsor. The operative complaint alleges, amongst other things, that the proxy statement related to the acquisition of Old Blade insufficiently disclosed EIC s cash position, Old Blade s value prospects and risks, and information related to Old Blade s chief executive officer, who is also our current chief executive officer. The consolidated complaints seeks, among other things, damages and attorneys fees and costs. Litigation is ongoing. The Company believes that all claims in the lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against them.

 The Company evaluated its warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 Fair Value Measurements for additional information.

 Redemption of Warrants for Shares of Common Stock The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: 
 in whole and not in part; 
 at a price equal to a number of shares of common stock to be determined, based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Company s common stock; 
 upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption; 
 if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 
 if, and only if, there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto is available throughout the 30-day period after the written notice of redemption is given. 
 If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption for cash, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis , as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net-cash settle the warrants.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On March 20, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of million of the Company's common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. The Company s stock repurchase programs may be suspended, modified or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice at the Company's discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and the Board s (or its designees determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did repurchase any shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of common stock in the open market. The average price per share was , resulting in a total aggregate amount of approximately . All share repurchases have been retired. There remains a potential repurchase capacity of approximately million under the stock repurchase program that was announced on March 20, 2024. 
 
 The Company follows the cost method for accounting for stock repurchases. All shares repurchased to date have been retired by the Company, and there were no unsettled share repurchases. When the Company retires its own common stock, the excess of the repurchase price over par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings subject to certain limitations. The allocation to additional paid-in capital is determined by applying a percentage, calculated by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued and outstanding as of the retirement date, to the balance of additional paid-in capital as of the retirement date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was deducted from accumulated deficit, and was deducted from additional paid-in capital, in relation to the retirement of the common stock.

Overview 
 
 Blade Air Mobility, Inc. Blade or the Company provides air transportation and logistics for hospitals across the United States, where it is one of the largest transporters of human organs for transplant, and for passengers, with helicopter and fixed wing services primarily in the Northeast United States and Southern Europe. Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft EVA or eVTOL ), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. 
 
 Blade operates in three key product lines across two segments (see Note 7 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information on reportable segments): 
 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Passenger segment 
 
 Short Distance Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe between 10 and 100 miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter basis. 
 Jet and Other Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New York and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers and certain ground transportation services. 
 Medical segment 
 MediMobility Organ Transport Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the medical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination and support evaluating potential donor organs through Trinity Organ Placement Services TOPS ), launched at the end of 2023. 
 
 Seats Flown 
 
 The following table reflects the key operating metric we use to evaluate the Passenger segment: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Seats flown all passenger flights 
 45,977 50,821 117,722 121,008 
 We define Seats flown all passenger flights (Seats Flown) as the total number of seats purchased by paying passengers on all flights, whether sold by-the-seat or within a charter arrangement. Our long-term consumer-facing strategy is primarily focused on growth in by-the-seat products, and we believe that Seats Flown is an important indicator of our progress in executing on this growth strategy. This metric is not always directly correlated with revenue given the significant variability in the price we charge per seat flown across our various products and routes. For products and routes sold by-the-seat, we fly significantly more passengers at a low price per seat; which is captured by Seats Flown. Passenger revenue is heavily influenced by the Jet and Other product lines where we typically fly fewer passengers over long distances at a high price. We believe the Seats Flown metric is useful to investors in understanding the overall scale of our Passenger segment and trends in the number of passengers paying to use our service. 
 
 The Activity in Canada ended on August 31, 2024. As a result, the three- and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, and 2023 included two and eight months, and three and nine months, respectively, of Seats Flown activity in Canada. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 
 Blade leverages an asset-light business model: we primarily utilize aircraft that are owned and/or operated by third-parties on Blade s behalf. In these arrangements, pilots, maintenance, hangar, insurance, and fuel are all costs borne by our network of operators, which provide aircraft flight time to Blade at fixed hourly rates. This enables our operator partners to focus on training pilots, maintaining aircraft and flying, while we maintain the relationship with our customer from booking through flight arrival. For flights offered for sale by-the-seat, Blade schedules flights based on demand analysis and takes the economic risk of aggregating fliers to optimize flight profitability, providing predictable margins for our operators. 
 
 When utilizing third-party aircraft and/or aircraft operators, we typically pre-negotiate fixed hourly rates and flight times, paying only for flights actually flown, creating a predictable and flexible cost structure. Blade provides guaranteed flight commitments to some of our third-party operators through capacity purchase agreements, which enable Blade to ensure dedicated access to such aircraft with enhanced crew availability, lower costs and, in many cases, the ability to unlock more favorable rates when flying more than the minimum number of hours we guarantee to the operator. Additionally, a significant portion of Blade trips are flown by safety-vetted operators to whom Blade makes no commitments, providing us with additional flexible capacity for high demand periods. 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 We also own a small number of fixed wing aircraft, operated and maintained by a third-party, that we utilize primarily for the Medical segment. We prioritize the use of owned aircraft and dedicated aircraft under capacity purchase agreements, which provide better economies of scale. We size our owned fleet and our commitments under capacity purchase agreements significantly below our expected demand, enabling us to maximize utilization on those aircraft while fulfilling incremental demand through our network of non-dedicated operators. 
 
 Blade s proprietary customer-to-cockpit technology stack enables us to manage fliers and organ transports across numerous simultaneous flights with multiple operators around the world. We believe that this technology, which provides (i) real-time tracking of organ transports and passenger flights; (ii) profit/loss information on a flight-by-flight basis; (iii) customized portals for all relevant parties including pilots, accounting teams, operator dispatch, transplant coordinators and Blade s logistics team; and (iv) a customer-facing app for passenger missions, will enable us to continue to scale our business. This technology stack was built with future growth in mind and is designed to allow our platform to be easily scaled to accommodate, among other things, rapid increases in volume, new routes, new operators, broader flight schedules, international expansion, next-generation verticraft and ancillary services (e.g., last/first-mile ground connections, trip cancellation insurance, baggage delivery) through our mobile apps, website and cloud-based tools. 
 
 Our asset-light business model was developed to be scalable and profitable using conventional aircraft today while enabling a seamless transition to EVA, once they are certified for public use. We intend to leverage the expected lower operating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the consumer s price for our flights. Additionally, we expect the reduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the development of new, vertical landing infrastructure vertiports in our existing and new markets. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Performance 
 Ability to attract and retain fliers in our Short Distance product line 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to cost-effectively attract new fliers, retain existing fliers, and increase utilization of our platform by existing fliers. Historically, we have made, and expect that we will need to continue to make, significant investments and implement strategic initiatives in order to attract new fliers, such as flier acquisition campaigns and the launching of new scheduled routes. These investments and initiatives may not be effective in generating sales growth or profits. In addition, marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the acquisition of additional fliers in a cost-effective manner, if at all. As our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns or brand content may not attract new fliers at the same rate as past campaigns or brand content. If we are unable to attract new fliers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 
 Our fliers have a wide variety of options for transportation, including business aviation, commercial airlines, private aircraft operators, personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit, and ride-sharing offerings. To expand our flier base, we must appeal to new fliers who have historically used other forms of transportation. If fliers do not perceive our urban air mobility services to be reliable, safe, and cost-effective, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain fliers or increase their utilization of our platform. If we fail to continue to grow our flier base, retain existing fliers, or increase the overall utilization of our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Ability to attract and retain customers in our MediMobility Organ Transport and Jet and Other product lines 
 Our MediMobility Organ Transport product line primarily serves transplant centers, organ procurement organizations and hospitals (collectively, Medical Customers ). Transportation for the hearts, lungs and livers that make up the vast majority of this product line is typically requested only hours before the required departure time. Our ability to successfully fulfill these requests with consistent pricing on the requested aircraft type, be it jet, turboprop or helicopter, is the primary metric by which Medical Customers evaluate our performance. 
 
 The organ transportation market is highly competitive and we compete for organ transportation business primarily on our ability to provide reliable, end-to-end air and ground transportation at competitive pricing. Increasingly, we compete directly with manufacturers of organ preservation equipment that also offer transportation or with providers that offer additional services, such as surgical organ recovery, that our customers find valuable. We may face increased competition as our Medical Customers may prefer a streamlined logistics offering, including services or technology that we cannot provide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

We utilize the same aircraft and aircraft operators in the Jet and Other product line of our Passenger segment. Historically, the combination of our Passenger and MediMobility Organ Transport demand, has been enough to incentivize operators to provide dedicated aircraft and crews for our use. However, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to secure dedicated aircraft at favorable rates, particularly given significant increases in demand for private jet aircraft in the United States in recent years. Periods of increased demand for private jets have historically led to increased charter costs and more limited availability in the spot jet charter market. Although this has not limited our ability to maintain or increase our access to dedicated jet aircraft at fixed prices in recent periods, jet charter, which makes up the majority of our Jet and Other product line, is highly competitive and volumes and pricing have historically been significantly influenced by overall market supply and demand. 
 Impact of inflation to our business 
 
 We generally pay a fixed hourly rate to our third-party operators, based on flight hours flown. These rates are susceptible to inflation and are typically renegotiated on a yearly basis, though some multi-year contracts have fixed rate increases. Some contracts with operators allow for pass-through of fuel price increases above a set threshold. For our owned aircraft, we are more directly exposed to inflation of aircraft operating expenses, including pilot salaries, fuel, insurance, parts and maintenance. 
 
 We have historically passed through cost inflation to customers and most contracts with our MediMobility Organ Transport customers automatically pass through any fuel surcharges, but there is no guarantee this will continue in the future. 
 
 Passenger Expansion into New Geographic Markets 
 
 Our Passenger segment growth plan is focused on dense urban areas, primarily those with existing air transportation infrastructure that are facing increasing ground congestion. Growth in our Passenger segment will depend in part on our ability to successfully enter into new markets, create and introduce new routes, and expand our existing routes by adding more frequent flights. In these areas, our urban air mobility services can provide the most time savings for our fliers, and given the short distances involved, costs for our services can be comparable to luxury, private car services. Significant changes to our existing routes or the introduction of new and unproven routes may require us to obtain and maintain applicable permits, authorizations, or other regulatory approvals. In addition, EVA may be commercially viable sooner in these markets given that battery technology constraints may limit the range of early models. Large urban markets with existing heliport infrastructure should be able to accommodate EVA while other cities may need several years to permit and build such infrastructure. 
 
 If these new or expanded routes are unsuccessful or fail to attract a sufficient number of fliers to be profitable, or we are unable to bring new or expanded routes to market efficiently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new third-party aircraft operator or flier demands regarding our services, including the availability of superior routes or a deterioration in the quality of our existing routes, could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our routes or our business model. The number of potential fliers using our urban air mobility services in any market cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to operate in a profitable manner in any of our current or targeted future markets. 
 Development, approval and acceptance of EVA for commercial service 
 
 We intend to leverage the expected lower operating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the price for our flights. Additionally, we expect the reduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the development of new vertiports in our existing and new markets. However, EVA involves a complex set of technologies, which we rely on original equipment manufacturers OEMs to develop and our third-party aircraft operators to adopt. However, before EVA can fly passengers or cargo, OEMs must receive requisite approvals from federal transportation authorities. No EVA aircraft are currently certified by the FAA for commercial operations in the United States, and there is no assurance that OEM research and development will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely manner, or at all. In order to gain government certification, the performance, reliability, and safety of EVA must be proven, none of which can be assured. Even if EVA aircraft are certified, individual operators must conform EVA aircraft to their licenses, which requires FAA approval, and individual pilots also must be licensed and approved by the FAA to fly EVA aircraft, which could contribute to delays in any widespread use of EVA and potentially limit the number of EVA operators available to our business. There is no assurance that research and

 development will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely manner, or at all. 
 We believe that Blade is well positioned to introduce EVA into commercial service, once available, for a number of reasons. In our Passenger segment, we believe our existing Short Distance routes will be compatible with EVA, which are initially expected to have a limited range, and our existing terminal space will accommodate EVA. Additionally, we believe that the last-mile transports we perform using helicopters or ground vehicles in our Medical segment may be compatible with EVA, reducing organ transport time and cost for our customers. Blade s unit economics are designed to be profitable using either conventional helicopters or EVA, even if early EVA do not deliver significant cost savings relative to helicopters. Moreover, Blade s asset-light business model and technology platform are operator and aircraft agnostic, enabling a seamless transition to EVA. 
 Seasonality 
 
 Passenger segment 
 
 Historically, we have experienced significant seasonality in our Short Distance product line with flight volume peaking during the quarters ended June 30 (Q2) and September 30 (Q3) of each fiscal year due to the busy summer travel season, with lower volume during the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4). 
 
 Jet and Other revenue has historically been stronger in the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4) given that our by-the-seat jet service between New York and South Florida has historically operated only between November and April. We discontinued this service in Q4 2023 and do not expect the seasonality in our Jet and Other revenue to be significant in 2024. 
 
 Medical segment 
 
 Historically, seasonality in our MediMobility Organ Transport product line has not been significant, though our trip volumes are correlated with the overall supply of donor hearts, livers and lungs in the United States, which can be volatile due to a variety of factors. 
 
 Key Components of the Company s Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Short Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card transactions, wire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. 
 
 Jet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates and our app and are paid for principally via checks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the time of booking before the performance of the related service. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. 
 
 MediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased through our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for principally via checks and wires. Payments are generally collected after the performance of the related service in accordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by 3.4 million or 5 , from 71.4 million in 2023 to 74.9 million in 2024. 
 Short Distance revenue increased by 2.0 million or 6 , from 30.4 million in 2023 to 32.4 million in 2024. Growth in Short Distance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a 2.3 million increase, and increased volumes of Northeast helicopter charters for a 0.8 million increase. This was partially offset by the August 31, 2024 termination of our Canada routes for a 0.8 million decrease, and lower activity in Europe for a 0.4 million decrease. 
 Jet and Other revenue decreased by 1.1 million or (15) from 7.6 million in 2023 to 6.5 million in 2024. The decline was driven by a decrease in jet charters of 1.4 million, partially offset by the introduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner Bus for a 0.3 million increase. 
 
 MediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by 2.6 million or 8 from 33.4 million in 2023 to 36.1 million in 2024. Growth in MediMobility Organ Transport was driven primarily by growth in ground revenue for 1.8 million and 0.4 million for TOPS (TOPS was launched at the end of 2023), the remainder was due to new clients. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by 16.6 million or 9 , from 177.7 million in 2023 to 194.3 million in 2024. 
 Short Distance revenue increased by 3.1 million or 5 from 60.0 million in 2023 to 63.1 million in 2024. Growth in Short Distance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a 2.2 million increase, growth in our New York airport transfer products, including annual pass activity, for a 1.0 million increase, and increased volumes of Northeast helicopter charters for a 1.0 million increase. This was partially offset by lower activity and the termination of our Canada routes for a 1.1 million decrease. 
 
 Jet and Other revenue decreased by (2.3) million or (10) from 23.1 million in 2023 to 20.8 million in 2024. 3.9 million decrease is attributable to the discontinuation of our seasonal by-the-seat jet service between New York and South Florida. This decrease was partially offset by a 0.9 million growth in jet charters, and higher brand partnership revenues and revenue from the introduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner Bus in the current year period. 
 MediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by 15.8 million or 17 from 94.6 million in 2023 to 110.4 million in 2024. The growth was driven primarily by: 6.6 million attributable to the addition of new hospital clients including of TOPS; higher revenue from existing clients of 13.5 million (higher volumes, higher revenue per trip and higher ground revenue). Those increases were partially offset by a 4.3 million decrease due to one temporary customer we supported only in the 2023 period. Excluding the impact of the temporary customer, revenue would have grown 22 versus the 2023 period.

Passenger segment 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Passenger revenue increased by 0.8 million or 2 , from 38.0 million in 2023 to 38.8 million in 2024. The increase was attributable to a 2.0 million increase in Short Distance offset by a 1.1 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue for more details. 
 
 Passenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by 2.8 million or 101 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.8 million in the same period of 2023 to 5.6 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable: to a 2.2 million impact from lower effective cost of revenue per flight in our New York airport transfer and Hamptons products (attributable to improved pricing and load factor in the by-the-seat products) and in Europe; and a 0.7 million improvement in Canada, which moved from a negative to a positive revenue less cost of revenue in the current year period compared to the prior year period (attributable to improved load factor and our exit from the Canadian market on August 31, 2024). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Passenger revenue increased by 0.8 million or 1 from 83.1 million in 2023 to 83.9 million in 2024. The increase was attributable to a 3.1 million increase in Short Distance that was partially offset by a 2.3 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue for more details. 
 
 Passenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from (2.4) million in the same period of 2023 to 3.7 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to higher revenue combined with lower effective cost of revenue per flight across all of Passenger flights (short distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period for a 4.9 million impact, attributable to improved pricing and improved load factor. Further improvements are attributable to a

 1.1 million decrease in marketing expenses and a 0.4 million decrease in personnel costs. These improvements were partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in staff costs. 
 Medical segment 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by 2.6 million or 8 , from 33.4 million in 2023 to 36.1 million in 2024 . Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue for more details. 
 
 Medical Adjusted EBITDA increased by 0.5 million or 15 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.3 million in the same period of 2023 to 3.9 million in 2024. Due to: 1.3 million increase in revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation) due to higher volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue per flight (due to higher revenue per flight hour and mix-shift towards dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of scale). This increase was partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily due to an increase in staff costs in order to support the higher activity and the new TOPS offering. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by 15.8 million or 17 , from 94.6 million in 2023 to 110.4 million in 2024. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue for more details. 
 
 Medical Adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.5 million or 67 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.2 million in the same period of 2023 to 13.8 million in 2024. 8.3 million of the increase is attributable to higher revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation) due to: larger volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue, attributable to: higher revenue per flight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is characterized with lower effective cost of revenue). This was partially offset by a 2.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily staff costs in order to support the higher activity, adding ground hubs and the new TOPS offering that did not exist in the prior year period.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA improved by 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.8 million in the same period of 2023 to 4.2 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to improvements in both Passenger and Medical Adjusted EBITDA (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a 0.1 million decrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses and software development staff costs. 
 
 Flight Profit increased by 4.3 million or 27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.6 million in the same period of 2023 to 19.8 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 5 increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of revenue per flight for both Passenger and Medical flights. In Passenger the lower effective cost of revenue per flight is attributable to improved pricing along with improved load factor in our US Short Distance flights, and a 0.7 million improvement in Canada (which operated at a negative Flight Profit in the prior year period). The lower effective cost of revenue per flight in Medical flights is attributable to higher revenue per flight hour and mix-shift to dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of scale.

 Flight Margin increased from 21.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 26.5 in the same period of 2023, attributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight Profit. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA improved by 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from (11.4) million in the same period of 2023 to 1.6 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to Adjusted EBITDA improvements of 6.1 million and 5.5 million in Passenger and Medical, respectively (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a 1.4 million decrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate costs and software development, attributable to a 1.0 million decrease in staff costs and a 0.5 million decrease in professional services and insurance. 
 
 Flight Profit increased by 13.2 million or 40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 33.1 million in the same period of 2023 to 46.3 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 9 increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of revenue per flight across all of Passenger product lines (Short Distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period attributable to improved pricing and improved load factor (in the by-the-seat products). In addition lower effective cost of revenue in Medical due to higher revenue per flight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is characterized with lower effective cost of revenue). 
 
 Flight Margin increased from 18.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.8 in the same period of 2024, attributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight Profit. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Certain non-GAAP measures included in this segment results of operations review have been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with GAAP but are not themselves GAAP measures. Blade believes that the non-GAAP measure discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These include Adjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin, which we define, explain the use of and reconcile to the nearest GAAP financial measure below. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4) interest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-term investments, (7) impairment of intangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.

 (2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents certain legal and regulatory advocacy fees for certain proposed restrictions at East Hampton Airport and the potential operational restrictions on large jet aircraft at Westchester Airport, that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. It is worth noting that we do not anticipate incurring any further legal fees related to the Westchester litigation. 
 (3) Trinity s contingent consideration, 2023 was the last year subject to an earn-out payment. 
 (4) Includes severance, retention, legal and other one-time restructuring costs associated with a reorganization of Blade Europe. 
 
 Flight Profit and Flight Margin 
 
 Flight Profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Flight Margin is calculated as Flight Profit divided by revenue. Flight Profit and Flight Margin are measures that management uses to assess the performance of the business. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide a useful measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with generating revenue such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade s owned aircraft. 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross Profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Flight Profit, is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and other costs directly related to revenue generating transactions, including credit card processing fees, depreciation and amortization, direct staff costs including stock-based compensation, commercial costs and establishment costs. Gross Margin is calculated as Gross Profit divided by revenue. The reconciliation of Gross Profit to Flight Profit can be found in the table below.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had total liquidity of 136.3 million and 166.1 million, respectively, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 20.0 million and 27.9 million, respectively, and short-term investments of 116.3 million and 138.3 million, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had restricted cash of 1.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 116.3 million of short-term investments consisted of securities that are traded in highly liquid markets. 
 
 With 136.3 million of total liquid funds as of September 30, 2024, we anticipate that we have sufficient funds to meet our current operational needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report. 
 Liquidity Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had net working capital of 144.6 million, zero debt, cash and cash equivalents of 20.0 million and short-term investments of 116.3 million. The Company had net losses of 17.5 million and 22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In the course of our business, we have certain contractual relationships with third-party aircraft operators pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments in the future. As of September 30, 2024 , we had commitments to purchase flights from various aircraft operators with aggregate minimum flight purchase guarantees of 2.4 million and 15.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively, 0.2 million and 8.7 million, respectively, of which may be cancelled by us immediately if a government authority enacts travel restrictions and million and 2.8 million, respectively, of which could be terminated by Blade for convenience upon 60 days notice with the annual minimum guarantee being pro-rated as of the termination date. See Capacity Purchase Agreements CPAs within Note 11 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for information about future periods. Additionally, the Company has operating lease obligations related to real estate and vehicles with expected annual minimum lease payments of 0.4 million and 2.0 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. See Note 5 Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for information about future periods. 
 
 We have non-cancellable commitments which primarily relate to cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. The amounts are determined based on the non-cancellable quantities to which we are contractually obligated. In December 2023, the Company entered into a technology service agreement with a vendor for cloud computing services where we are committed to spend 0.1 million and 1.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. 
 
 On March 20, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of 20.0 million of the Company's common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.2 million of common stock pursuant to this program ending with a remaining potential repurchase capacity under the program of approximately 19.8 million. No shares were repurchased in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. 
 
 We expect to incur net losses in the short term, as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives. Based on our current liquidity, we believe that no additional capital will be needed to execute our current business plan over the next 12 months. Our longer term liquidity requirement will depend on many factors including the pace of our expansion into new markets, our ability to attract and retain customers for our existing products, capital expenditures and acquisitions.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (767) (23,029) Net cash (used in) / provided by investing activities (4,992) 17,014 Net cash used in financing activities (1,885) (53) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash balances 29 (81) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (7,615) (6,149) 
 Cash Used In Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 0.8 million, driven by a net loss of 17.5 million and 3.2 million of cash used for working capital requirements, adjusted for non-cash items consisting of stock-based compensation expense of 15.4 million, impairment of intangible assets of 5.8 million , depreciation and amortization of 4.4 million, non-cash accretion of interest income on held-to-maturity securities of 3.1 million and income from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2.3 million. The 3.2 million of cash used for working capital requirements was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 8.3 million, driven by the cash payment for the Trinity contingent consideration compensation and for the 2023 short term incentive plan paid in March of 2024, an increase in accounts receivable of 3.6 million (attributable to the revenue growth in the Medical segment) and a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.2 million (driven by Passenger client prepayments and gift cards); partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 8.3 million (driven by the utilization of 9.3 million of prepaid deposits under CPAs with M N as part of the purchase of the seven aircraft, slightly offset by new prepayments made to operators in connection with new CPAs) and a decrease in other non-current assets of 0.5 million (a lease deposit refund).

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 This discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 For information on the Company s significant accounting policies and estimates refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
 There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We determined that our internal control over financial reporting had the following material weaknesses: 
 
 A lack of effective IT General Controls in relation to: 
 user access controls that adequately restrict user access to financial applications, programs and data affecting underlying accounting records, and 
 the change management controls for certain operational applications that ensure IT program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized and implemented properly. 
 
 A number of control deficiencies in relation to the revenue process that, although not individually material in nature, in aggregate constitute a material weakness. 
 
 Management has concluded that these deficiencies may impact the Company s financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and represent a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 Because disclosure controls and procedures include those components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management also determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the above-mentioned material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Management s Plans for Remediation 
 
 We have identified and implemented, and continue to implement, certain remediation efforts to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include the following measures to address the material weaknesses identified: 
 
 We have completed controls testing to enable management to assess the operating effectiveness of the change management controls for the Company s main operational IT application and we are in the process of implementing those same change management controls for our other operational IT applications. 
 We are re-enforcing procedures on proper user access administration and the need for timely documentation of associated requests and approvals. 
 We have designed additional controls to supplement the existing business process controls in relation to revenues, with these controls implemented in Q3 2024. 
 
 We expect the above actions will be completed before the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and improve the applicable controls, management may take additional remedial measures or modify the remediation plan described above. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the specific remediation steps discussed above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024. 
 
 Limitations on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 An internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
