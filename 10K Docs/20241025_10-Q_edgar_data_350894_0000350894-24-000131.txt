As a result, one of the Company's client relationships formerly reported in the Private Banks segment will be reported in the Investment Managers segment and the Company s family office services business, formerly reported in the Investment Managers segment, will be reported in the Investments in New Businesses segment. The business segment financial presentation was reclassified in 2024 to conform to this reorganization. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

 The Company files income tax returns in the United States on a consolidated basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination of income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for years before 2020 and is no longer subject to state, local or foreign income tax examinations by authorities for years before 2018. 
 The Company estimates it will recognize of gross unrecognized tax benefits. This amount is expected to be paid within one year or to be removed at the expiration of the statute of limitations and resolution of income tax audits and is netted against the current payable account. These unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax positions taken on certain federal, state, and foreign tax returns. However, the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. While it is reasonably possible that some issues under examination could be resolved in the next twelve months, based upon the current facts and circumstances, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such resolution or the total range of potential changes as it relates to the current unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as part of the Company s financial statements. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15 for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar Two). Certain aspects of Pillar Two are effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar Two. The Company has determined Pillar Two will not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate, consolidated results of operation, financial position, or cash flows.

of Rubicon s clients that had custodial accounts at SPTC filed state civil actions for fraud in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Rubicon, its founder, Scott Mason, Mr. Mason s wife, Lynne Mason, and Orchard Park Real Estate Holdings LLC (Orchard Park), a business owned by the Masons. The fraud allegation (the Allegation) is based on the claim that Mr. Mason used Rubicon client funds to invest in Orchard Park, an entity allegedly formed and controlled by Mr. Mason, and that all such invested funds were subsequently withdrawn from Orchard Park by the Masons and were used for their own, extensive personal expenses. It has been reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating Mr. Mason and his wife. The Company is also aware of at least other cases filed in other jurisdictions against Rubicon and/or the Masons and Orchard Park, and there may be additional cases filed against Rubicon and/or the Masons of which the Company is unaware. 
 As of October 17, 2024, separate, but related, suits have been filed against SPTC in its capacity as custodian for the Rubicon accounts of the plaintiffs. These actions were also filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and are: Star Sitron vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-17132 (Sitron); Charles Murray vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-18391 (Murray); James A. Byrne Sharon Byrne vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-20612; Melody Pettinelli Melody Pettinelli as Trustee of the Donald Pettinelli Trust dated 11/7/1996 vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case. 2024-21377; Norman Love vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21361; Stephen Red Carla Red vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21902; Edward A. Tettemer Lyn K. Tettemer vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21827; and Jonathan Klein Sara Klein vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024- 23294 (collectively, the Rubicon Actions). Based on the complaints that have thus far been filed in the Rubicon Actions, these actions appear to be based generally on similar theories that include alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of state consumer protection laws by SPTC in connection with certain transfers of Plaintiffs assets from SPTC custodial accounts to Orchard Park bank accounts. SPTC has been served with complaints in of the Rubicon Actions, Sitron and Murray. In the remaining Rubicon Actions, the plaintiffs have commenced suit but have not filed their formal complaints. The Sitron and Murray cases are both in the early stages, with initial motion practice and discovery now occurring. 
 On August 8, 2024, SPTC filed preliminary objections to the plaintiff s complaint in Sitron, which remain pending. On September 12, 2024 the Sitron court issued an initial case management order requiring, among other things, fact discovery to be completed within approximately months and dispositive motions to be filed within months from the commencement of the action. On October 16, 2024, SPTC filed preliminary objections to the plaintiff s claims in Murray, which also remain pending. On October 7, 2024, the Murray court issued an initial case management order requiring, among other things, fact discovery to be completed within and dispositive motions to be filed within months of commencement of the action. 
 While the Rubicon Actions are in their infancy and the ultimate outcomes of these litigations remain uncertain, SEI and SPTC intend to defend each of the Rubicon Actions. Currently, SPTC estimates that the aggregate amount of Rubicon client assets transferred at the direction of Mr. Mason from SPTC custodial accounts to Orchard Park bank accounts is approximately . In the event that SPTC is unsuccessful in its defense of the Rubicon Actions, SEI does not currently believe that the losses associated with such unsuccessful defense would exceed the approximately of Rubicon client assets that Mr. Mason directed to be transferred to Orchard Park.

 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues 537,396 476,759 13 1,567,961 1,434,935 9 Expenses 393,564 368,287 7 1,161,764 1,112,095 4 Income from operations 143,832 108,472 33 406,197 322,840 26 Net gain (loss) from investments 427 (206) (307) 3,349 1,053 218 Interest income, net of interest expense 13,438 11,009 22 35,531 29,057 22 Other income 8,151 NM 8,151 NM Equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliate 36,513 29,927 22 102,375 91,517 12 Income before income taxes 202,361 149,202 36 555,603 444,467 25 Income taxes 47,461 33,541 42 130,183 102,940 26 Net income 154,900 115,661 34 425,420 341,527 25 Diluted earnings per common share 1.19 0.87 37 3.23 2.54 27 
 The following items had a significant impact on our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Revenue from Assets under management, administration, and distribution fees increased in the first nine months of 2024 primarily from higher assets under administration due to cross sales to existing alternative investment clients of the Investment Managers segment as well as new sales within the segment. Average assets under administration increased 132.4 billion, or 15 , to 998.4 billion during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 866.0 billion during the first nine months of 2023. 
 Revenue from Asset management, administration and distribution fees also increased from market appreciation and positive cash flows into separately managed account programs and Strategist programs of the Investment Advisors segment. This was partially offset by negative cash flows from SEI fund programs and fee reductions in separately managed account programs. Revenue growth was also partially offset by client losses in the Institutional Investors segment. Average assets under management in equity and fixed income programs, excluding LSV, increased 8.8 billion, or 5 , to 177.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 169.1 billion during the first nine months of 2023. 
 Fees from the SEI Integrated Cash Program of the Investment Advisors segment launched in December 2023 were 10.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 30.4 million during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Revenue from Information processing and software servicing fees increased in the first nine months of 2024 primarily from new client conversions and growth from existing SEI Wealth Platform SM (SWP) clients. A one-time early contractual buyout fee of 10.5 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 from an investment 

29 

processing client of the Private Banks segment acquired by an existing client partially offset the increase in revenues. 
 Earnings from LSV increased to 102.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 91.5 million in the first nine months of 2023 due to market appreciation and higher performance fees. Negative cash flows from existing clients and client losses partially offset the increase in earnings from LSV. 
 Operating expenses increased from higher personnel costs due to business growth, primarily in the Investment Managers segment, stock-based compensation, and the impact of inflation on wages and services. Cost containment measures related to consulting and other vendor costs partially offset the increase in operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Capitalized software development costs were 18.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, of which 10.5 million was for continued enhancements to SWP. Capitalized software development costs also include 5.0 million of software development costs in the first nine months of 2024 for a new platform for the Investment Managers segment. 
 Amortization expense related to SWP was 20.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 19.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Interest and dividend income was 36.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 29.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to an overall increase in interest rates and higher invested cash balances. 
 In July 2024, SEI sold a condominium located in New York, New York and recognized a net pre-tax gain of 8.2 million, or 0.05 diluted earnings per share, after associated costs and expenses. The gain from the sale is included in Other income on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Effective tax rates were 23.5 during the third quarter 2024 and 22.5 during the third quarter 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, effective tax rates were 23.4 and 23.2 , respectively. 
 SEI repurchased 3.7 million shares of its common stock for 253.0 million in the first nine months of 2024.

Advised assets include assets for which we provide advisory services through a subsidiary to the accounts but do not manage the underlying assets. Assets under administration include total assets of our clients or their customers for which we provide administrative services, including client fund balances for which we provide administration and/or distribution services through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest. Platform-only assets-deposit program include assets of our clients in the SEI Integrated Cash program for which we provide custody services through our federal thrift subsidiary. The assets presented in the preceding tables do not include assets processed on SWP and are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets because we do not own them.

 Increased revenues from SEI Private Wealth Management through higher assets under advisement due to market appreciation and new business. 

Other 
 Corporate overhead expenses 
 Corporate overhead expenses primarily consist of general and administrative expenses and other costs not directly attributable to a reportable business segment. Corporate overhead expenses were 37.9 million and 31.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 109.0 million and 94.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in corporate overhead expenses is primarily due to severance costs, stock-based compensation costs and investments in upgrading and enhancing various technologies utilized by corporate overhead units. Additionally, personnel costs increased from enhancements to further build our compliance infrastructure. 
 Other income and expense 
 Other income and expense items on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations consist of: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net gain (loss) from investments 427 (206) 3,349 1,053 Interest and dividend income 13,579 11,125 35,950 29,453 Interest expense (141) (116) (419) (396) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate 36,513 29,927 102,375 91,517 Other income 8,151 8,151 Total other income and expense items, net 58,529 40,730 149,406 121,627 
 Net gain (loss) from investments 
 Net gain from investments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to unrealized mark-to-market gains recorded in current earnings associated with LSV-sponsored investment funds and Company-sponsored investment funds from market appreciation (See Note 5). 
 Interest and dividend income 
 Interest and dividend income is earned based upon the amount of cash that is invested daily. The increase in interest and dividend income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an overall increase in interest rates. 
 Other income 
 Other income is related to a net gain of 8.2 million recognized from the sale of property located in New York, New York during July 2024 (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate reflects our ownership interest in LSV. As of September 30, 2024, our total partnership interest in LSV was 38.6 . The table below presents the revenues and net income of LSV and the proportionate share in LSV's earnings.

Three Months Ended September 30, Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues of LSV 122,412 102,183 20 343,581 309,211 11 Net income of LSV 94,634 77,566 22 265,335 237,119 12 SEI's proportionate share in earnings of LSV 36,513 29,927 22 102,375 91,517 12 
 The increase in earnings from LSV in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher assets under management from market appreciation and higher performance fees. Negative cash flows from existing clients and client losses partially offset the increase in earnings from LSV. Average assets under management by LSV increased 5.5 billion to 91.6 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 86.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6 . 
 
 Amortization 
 Amortization expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Capitalized software development costs 7,069 6,658 6 20,961 19,470 8 Intangible assets acquired through acquisitions and asset purchases 3,276 3,065 7 10,066 9,178 10 Other 68 74 (8) 257 203 27 Total amortization expense 10,413 9,797 6 31,284 28,851 8 
 Capitalized software development costs 
 The increase in amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to significant enhancements to SWP (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differ from the federal income tax statutory rate due to the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Statutory rate 21.0 21.0 21.0 21.0 State taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.9 2.8 2.9 2.8 Foreign tax expense and tax rate differential 0.1 (0.1) 0.1 (0.1) Tax benefit from stock option exercises (0.1) (0.6) (0.4) (0.3) Other, net (0.4) (0.6) (0.2) (0.2) 23.5 22.5 23.4 23.2 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We recognized 37.2 million and 23.5 million in stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to new equity awards granted during the fourth quarter 2023. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is primarily based upon management's estimate of when the financial vesting targets of outstanding stock options may be achieved. Any change in the estimate could result in the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be accelerated, spread out over a longer period, or reversed. This may cause volatility in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense in future periods and could materially affect earnings (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

39 

We revised our estimate of when some vesting targets are expected to be achieved. This change in estimate resulted in an increase of 3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to recognize approximately 31.9 million in stock-based compensation expense during the remainder of 2024. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, except for the investment funds sponsored by LSV, is determined in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investment funds sponsored by LSV is measured using the net asset value per share (NAV) as a practical expedient. The fair value of all other financial assets are determined using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs and consist mainly of investments in equity or fixed-income mutual funds that are quoted daily and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and other U.S. government agency securities that are single issuer pools that are valued based on current market data of similar assets. Level 3 financial liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist entirely of the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from an acquisition (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Like many firms operating within the financial services industry, we are experiencing a complex and changing regulatory environment across our markets. Our current scale and reach as a provider to the financial services industry, the introduction and implementation of new solutions for our financial services industry clients, the increased regulatory oversight of the financial services industry generally, new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry and ever-changing regulatory interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and a greater propensity of regulators to pursue enforcement actions and other sanctions against regulated entities, have made this an increasingly challenging and costly regulatory environment in which to operate. 
 SEI and some of our regulated subsidiaries have undergone or been scheduled to undergo a range of periodic or thematic reviews, examinations or investigations by numerous regulatory authorities around the world, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (FCA), the Central Bank of Ireland and others. These regulatory activities typically result in the identification of matters or practices to be addressed by us or our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, the regulatory authorities require remediation activities or pursue enforcement proceedings against us or our subsidiaries. From time to time, the regulators in different jurisdictions will elevate their level of scrutiny of our operations as our business expands or is deemed critical to the operations of the relevant financial markets. As described under the caption Regulatory Considerations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the range of possible sanctions that are available to regulatory authorities include limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time, the revocation of registration, censures and fines. The direct and indirect costs of responding to these regulatory activities and of complying with new or modified regulations, as well as the potential financial costs and potential reputational impact against us of any enforcement proceedings that might result, is uncertain but could have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial position. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 Our credit facility provides for borrowings up to 325.0 million and is scheduled to expire in April 2026 (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of October 22, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit of 4.9 million which reduced the amount available under the credit facility. These letters of credit were primarily issued for the expansion of the corporate headquarters and are due to expire in late 2024. As of October 22, 2024, the amount of the credit facility available for corporate purposes was 320.1 million. 
 The availability of the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement. The credit facility contains covenants which restrict our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates other than wholly-owned subsidiaries or to incur liens or certain types of indebtedness as defined in the agreement. In the event of a default under 

40 

the credit facility, we would also be restricted from paying dividends on, or repurchasing our common stock. Currently, our ability to borrow from the credit facility is not limited by any covenant of the agreement (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 The majority of excess cash reserves are primarily placed in accounts located in the United States that invest entirely in SEI-sponsored money market mutual funds denominated in the U.S. dollar. We also utilize demand deposit accounts or money market accounts at several large, well-established financial institutions located in the United States. The institutions we utilize have not indicated any stability issues regarding the ability to honor current or future deposit obligations to their customers. Accounts used to manage these excess cash reserves do not impose any restrictions or limitations that would prevent us from being able to access such cash amounts immediately. As of October 22, 2024, the amount of cash and cash equivalents considered free and immediately accessible for other general corporate purposes was 520.6 million. 
 Cash and cash equivalents include accounts managed by subsidiaries that are used in their operations or to cover specific business and regulatory requirements. The availability of this cash for other purposes beyond the operations of these subsidiaries may be limited. We therefore do not include accounts of foreign subsidiaries in the calculation of free and immediately accessible cash for other general corporate purposes. A portion of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are deemed repatriated. Any subsequent transfer of available cash related to the repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries could significantly increase free and immediately accessible cash. 
 Cash flows from operations increased 81.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily from the increase in net income. The negative impact from the change in working capital accounts, primarily due to increased client receivables, partially offset the increase in cash flows from operations. 
 Net cash used in investing activities includes: 
 Purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities. Purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Purchases (134,665) (83,968) Sales and maturities 121,347 90,245 Net investing activities from marketable securities (13,318) 6,277 
 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to marketable securities. 
 The capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software. We capitalized 18.4 million of software development costs in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 26.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. Software development costs are principally related to significant enhancements for the expanded functionality of the SEI Wealth Platform and a new platform for the Investment Managers segment. 
 Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 were 27.2 million as compared to 23.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. Expenditures in 2024 and 2023 include capital outlays for purchased software and equipment for data center operations. We continue to evaluate improvements to our information technology infrastructure which, if implemented, will result in additional expenditures for purchased software and equipment for data center operations. 
 Proceeds from fixed asset dispositions. We received proceeds of 9.9 million after associated costs and expenses from the sale of property located in New York, New York in the third quarter 2024. 
 Other investing activities. In February 2024, we made a strategic investment of 10.0 million in an innovation platform for wealth management. 
 Net cash used in financing activities includes: 
 The repurchase of common stock. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of common stock through multiple authorizations. Currently, there is no expiration date for the common stock repurchase program. We had total capital outlays of 252.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 236.9 million during the first nine months of 2023 for the repurchase of common stock. 
 Proceeds from the issuance of common stock. We received 62.8 million and 65.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These proceeds were primarily from stock option exercise activity. 
 Dividend payments. Cash dividends paid were 120.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 114.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. 

41 

Cash Requirements 
 Cash requirements and liquidity needs are primarily funded through cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing. At September 30, 2024, unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and the amount available under our credit facility. 
 We are obligated to make payments in connection with the credit facility, operating leases, maintenance contracts and other commitments. We believe our operating cash flow, available borrowing capacity, and existing cash and cash equivalents will provide adequate funds for these obligations and ongoing operations. We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our stock repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

 In addition to the regulatory authorities listed above, our subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we also own a minority interest of approximately 38.6 in LSV, which is also an investment advisor registered with the SEC. 
 The Company, its regulated subsidiaries, their regulated services and solutions and their customers are all subject to extensive legislation, regulation, and supervision that recently has been subject to, and continues to experience, 

43 

significant change and increased regulatory activity. These changes and regulatory activities could have a material adverse effect on us and our clients. 
 The various governmental agencies and self-regulatory authorities that regulate or supervise the Company and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with laws, regulations, and requirements of these agencies and authorities, the possible business process changes required or sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time, the revocation of applicable registration as a broker-dealer, investment advisor or other regulated entity, and, as the case may be, censures and fines. Additionally, certain securities and banking laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business. 
 Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to our regulated subsidiaries and their activities, services and solutions, our business practices, our past actions and other matters has increased dramatically in the past several years. Responding to these examinations, investigations, actions, and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties, fines and changes to business processes sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. We continue to be subject to inquiries from examinations and investigations by supervisory and enforcement divisions of regulatory authorities and expect this to continue in the future. We believe this is also the case with many of our regulated clients. Governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation, our relationship with clients and prospective clients, and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. 
 We are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws that require implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. We offer investment and banking solutions that also are subject to regulation by the federal and state securities and banking authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities, where applicable. Existing or future regulations that affect these solutions could lead to a reduction in sales of these solutions or require modifications of these solutions. 
 We must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the United States, as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. We can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject us and our subsidiaries, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. 
 Our businesses are also subject to privacy and data protection information security legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain personal information. These include those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the United States, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, Canada s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Cayman Islands' Data Protection Law, and various other laws. Privacy and data security legislation is a priority issue in many states and localities in the United States, as well as foreign jurisdictions outside of the EU. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which broadly regulates the sale of the consumer information of California residents and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances. Other states are considering similar proposals. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. Ensuring compliance under ever-evolving privacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA, is an ongoing commitment, which involves substantial costs. 
 Compliance with existing and future regulations and responding to and complying with recent increased regulatory activity affecting broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, financial institutions, and their service providers could have a significant impact on us. We periodically undergo regulatory examinations and respond to regulatory inquiries and document requests. In addition, recent and continuing legislative activity in the United States and in other jurisdictions (including the European Union and the United Kingdom) have made and continue to make extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. As a result of these examinations, inquiries, and requests, as a result of increased civil litigation activity, and as a result of these new laws and regulations, we engage legal counsel and other subject matter experts, review our compliance procedures, solution and service offerings, and business operations, and 

44 

make changes as we deem necessary or as may be required by the applicable authority. These additional activities and required changes may result in increased expense or may reduce revenues. 
 Our bank clients are subject to supervision by federal, state, and foreign banking and financial services authorities concerning the manner in which such clients purchase and receive our products and services. Our plan sponsor clients and our subsidiaries providing services to those clients are subject to supervision by the Department of Labor and compliance with employee benefit regulations. Investment advisor and broker-dealer clients are regulated by the SEC, state securities authorities, or FINRA. Existing or future regulations applicable to our clients may affect our clients purchase of our products and services. 
 In addition, see the discussion of governmental regulations in Item 1A Risk Factors in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the risks that the current regulatory regimes and proposed regulatory changes may present for our business. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Information required by this item is set forth under the captions "Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in capital markets and significant changes in the value of financial instruments" and "Changes in interest rates may affect the value of our fixed-income investment securities" in Item 1A Risk Factors and under the caption "Sensitivity of our revenues and earnings to capital market fluctuations" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to this information as it is disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 (b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

45 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings, examinations and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe are material. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on SEI as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty. These matters include the proceedings summarized in Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Information regarding risk factors appears in Part I Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in the risk factors from those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 (e) Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 5.828 billion worth of our common stock through multiple authorizations through September 30, 2024.
