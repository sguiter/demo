With respect to its consolidated development projects, the Company wholly owns three land parcels located at 355 399 Exterior Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the Bronx borough of New York City, which it acquired for the development of a mixed-use multifamily residential and commercial retail project (the Exterior Street Project and the Company has a 50 joint venture ownership interest in LSC 1543 7th LLC (the Santa Monica Joint Venture ), a joint venture between the Company and a related party, which owns certain land parcels located in Santa Monica, California, on which a multifamily residential project (the Santa Monica Project has been proposed (see Notes 3 and 7). 

The Company also wholly owns and consolidates certain land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida. 

With respect to our unconsolidated joint venture properties, the Company holds a 19 joint venture ownership interest in Columbus Portfolio Member LLC (the Columbus Joint Venture ), which owns the Columbus Properties, a portfolio of nine multifamily residential properties located in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area, and it holds a joint venture ownership interest in LVP Holdco JV LLC (the Hotel Joint Venture ), which owns the Hotel JV Properties, a portfolio of five limited service hotels. The Company accounts for its 19 joint venture ownership interest in the Columbus Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting and it accounts for its 2.5 joint venture ownership interest in the Hotel Joint Venture using a measurement alternative pursuant to which its investment is measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, if any. Both the Columbus Joint Venture and the Hotel Joint Venture are between the Company and related parties. 

The Company s advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT, LLC (the Advisor ), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On July 6, 2004, the Advisor contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for Common Units. The Company s Advisor also owns shares of the Company s common stock Common Shares which were issued on July 6, 2004 for , or per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of The Lightstone Group, LLC (the Sponsor ), which served as the Company s sponsor during its initial public offering (the Offering ), which terminated on October 10, 2008. The Company s Advisor, pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, together with its board of directors (the Board of Directors ), is primarily responsible for making investment decisions on the Company s behalf and managing its day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of Sponsor, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which owns an aggregate of million of special general partner interests SLP Units in the Operating Partnership which were purchased, at a cost of per unit, in connection with the Company s Offering. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT I or the Operating Partnership. 

The Company has no employees. The Company is dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of its Sponsor for performing a full range of services that are essential to it, including asset management, property management (excluding its hospitality property, which is managed by unrelated third party property managers) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Company s Sponsor are unable to provide these services to it, the Company would be required to provide the services itself or obtain the services from other parties. 

The Company s Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its Common Shares at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any active market for its Common Shares until they are listed for trading. 

Related Parties 

The Company s Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates, including Lightstone SLP, LLC, are related parties of the Company as well as other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement of costs incurred for services related to the investment, management and disposition of the Company s assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

Noncontrolling Interests 

Partners of Operating Partnership 

On July 6, 2004, the Advisor contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for Common Units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert the Common Units into cash or, at the option of the Company, an equal number of shares of Common Shares. 

In connection with the Offering, Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, purchased an aggregate of million of SLP Units. As the majority owner of the SLP Units, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a interest in such SLP Units and thus receives an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof. These SLP Units may be entitled to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that the Company makes to its stockholders, but only after the Company s stockholders have received a stated preferred return. 

In addition, an aggregate Common Units were issued to other unrelated parties during 2008 and 2009 and remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

Other Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries 

Other noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries include the joint venture ownership interests held by either the Sponsor or its affiliates in (i) Pro-DFJV Holdings LLC PRO ), (ii) the 2 nd Street Joint Venture and (iii) the Santa Monica Joint Venture (see Note 3). PRO s holdings principally consist of Marco OP Units and Marco II OP Units (see Note 6). The 2 nd Street Joint Venture owns Gantry Park Landing and the Santa Monica Joint Venture owns the Santa Monica Project (see Notes 3 and 7). 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes as contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Lightstone Value Plus REIT I, Inc. and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete financial statements. 

GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate and real-estate related investments, marketable securities, notes receivable, depreciable lives, and revenue recognition. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein has been derived from the consolidated balance sheet included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

The unaudited consolidated statements of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or any other period. 

income tax expense was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of million. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of million, primarily consisting of federal and state income tax related to the redemptions of its preferred investments in related parties. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had material uncertain income tax positions.

million and recognized a gain on disposition of real estate of million. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed the disposition of two more of its land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida, each to an unrelated third-party, for an aggregate contractual sales price of million and recognized an aggregate gain on disposition of real estate of million. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of certain municipal impact fee credits, which were attributable to the development of its former outlet center located in St. Augustine, Florida, which was substantially demolished during 2022, to an unrelated third-party for a contractual sales price of million and recognized a gain on disposition of real estate of million. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company s land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida was million and million, respectively, which is included in land and land improvements on the consolidated balance sheets.

million, excluding closing and other acquisition related costs. In September 2021, the Company subsequently acquired an additional adjacent parcel of land at cost from an affiliate of its Advisor for million in order to achieve certain zoning compliance. These three land parcels were acquired by the Company for the development of the Exterior Street Project. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest of million was capitalized to the Exterior Street Project. 

During the second quarter of 2023, the Company decided to temporarily pause active development activities associated with the Exterior Street Project, due to prevailing unfavorable economic and local market conditions and regulations, and therefore, ceased capitalization of interest and other carrying costs. 

Impairment Charge 

Because of continuing unfavorable economic and local market conditions, the Company determined during the third quarter of 2024 it would no longer pursue the development of the Exterior Street Project, but rather pursue other strategies with respect to it, including a sale. As a result of this change in strategy; the Company determined the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project was no longer fully recoverable and therefore, recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million, (included in impairment charges on the Company s consolidated statement of operations) during the third quarter of 2024 to reduce the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project to its estimated fair value of million as of September 30, 2024. In estimating the fair value of the Exterior Street Project, the Company took into consideration a bona fide third-party offer obtained from an independent third-party broker. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project was million and million, respectively, which is included in development projects on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Santa Monica Project 

The Company has a joint venture ownership interest in the Santa Monica Joint Venture. The Santa Monica Joint Venture, which the Company consolidates, is between the Company and a related party. In March 2022, the Santa Monica Joint Venture originated a 49.0 million promissory note (the Santa Monica Note Receivable to a borrower (the Santa Monica Borrower ), which was collateralized by two development projects located in Santa Monica, California. The Santa Monica Note Receivable bore interest at SOFR + 7.00 , subject to a 7.15 floor. 

During the first quarter of 2023, the Santa Monica Joint Venture received a partial paydown of 14.0 million on the Santa Monica Note Receivable in exchange for the release of one of the development projects, which had been completed, from the underlying collateral pool. As a result, the remaining outstanding balance of the Santa Monica Note Receivable of 35.0 million was secured solely by the Santa Monica Project, which consists of a proposed multifamily residential project on land located in Santa Monica, California. 

Due to financial difficulties, during the second quarter of 2023 the Santa Monica Borrower discontinued making monthly interest payments on the Santa Monica Note Receivable, which subsequently matured on August 31, 2023. On December 29, 2023, ownership of the Santa Monica Project was transferred to the Santa Monica Joint Venture via a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction. In connection with the transfer, the outstanding principal and accrued interest for the Santa Monica Note Receivable of 36.7 million, which represented the fair value of the Santa Monica Project and approximated the carrying value of the Santa Monica Note Receivable, was reclassified from notes receivable, net to development projects on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Impairment Charge 

Subsequent to obtaining ownership of the Santa Monica Project, the Santa Monica Joint Venture decided to continue certain pre-development activities, which had already been started by the former owner. However, during the third quarter of 2024, the Santa Monica Joint Venture decided to no longer pursue development of the Santa Monica Project, but rather pursue various other strategies with respect to it, including a sale or the potential transfer of ownership to the lender, which had provided a non-recourse mortgage loan (the Santa Monica Loan ), collateralized by the Santa Monica Project As a result of the change in strategy, the Santa Monica Joint Venture determined the carrying value of the Santa Monica Project was no longer fully recoverable and therefore, recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million (which is included in impairment charges on the Company s consolidated statement of operations) during the third quarter of 2024 in order to reduce the carrying value of the Santa Monica Project to its estimated fair value of million as of September 30, 2024. In estimating the fair value of the Santa Monica Project , the Santa Monica Joint Venture used the fair value provided by an independent, third-party commercial real estate advisory and services firm. 

On October 15, 2024 the Santa Monica Loan matured and it was not repaid, which constitutes a maturity event of default and therefore, it is due on demand. On October 30, 2024, the lender issued a formal notice of default and on October 31, 2024, the Santa Monica Joint Venture notified the lender of its intent to transfer ownership of the underlying collateral, the Santa Monica Project, to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction. See Note 7 for additional information.

Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Columbus Joint Venture are made to the members pursuant to the terms of the Columbus Joint Venture s operating agreement. 

In connection with the purchase of the Columbus Properties on November 29, 2022, the Columbus Joint Venture obtained senior mortgage loans from two different financial institutions. The first financial institution provided four separate senior mortgage loans, all to subsidiaries of the Columbus Joint Venture, aggregating 133.6 million. These four senior mortgage loans bear interest at SOFR + 2.19 , provide for interest-only payments for the first six years of their term and mature in December 2032. Each of these four senior mortgage loans is individually collateralized by one of the Columbus Properties (collectively, the Columbus Portfolio I Properties ). The second financial institution provided five separate senior mortgage loans, all to subsidiaries of the Columbus Joint Venture, aggregating 167.2 million. These five senior mortgage loans bear interest at 4.85 , provide for interest-only payments for the first two years of their term and initially mature in December 2027, but may be further extended for an additional five years, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Each of these five senior mortgage loans is individually collateralized by one of the Columbus Properties (collectively, the Columbus Portfolio II Properties ).

Each of the members of the Columbus Joint Venture have agreed to reimburse the Guarantor for their pro rata share of any balance that becomes due under the Debt Guarantee, of which the Company s share is up to 19 . The Company has determined that the fair value of the Debt Guarantee is immaterial.

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The fair values of the Company s preferred equity securities and corporate bonds are measured using readily available quoted prices for these securities; however, the markets for these securities are not active. Additionally, as noted and disclosed above, the Company s Marco OP and OP II units are both ultimately exchangeable for cash or similar number of shares of Simon Stock, therefore the Company uses the quoted market price of Simon Stock to measure the fair value of the Company s Marco OP and OP II units.

28 

We have no employees. We are dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor for performing a full range of services that are essential to us, including asset management, property management (excluding our hospitality property, which is managed by an unrelated third party property manager) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal information technology and investor relations.

The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

Concentration of Credit Risk

Development Projects 

Exterior Street Project 

We wholly own the Exterior Street Project, a proposed mixed-use multifamily residential and commercial retail project. In February 2019, we, through subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, acquired two adjacent parcels of land located at 355 and 399 Exterior Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the Bronx borough of New York City from unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate purchase price of 59.0 million, excluding closing and other acquisition related costs. In September 2021, we subsequently acquired an additional adjacent parcel of land at cost from an affiliate of our Advisor for 1.0 million in order to achieve certain zoning compliance. These three land parcels were acquired by us for the development of the Exterior Street Project. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest of 1.5 million was capitalized to the Exterior Street Project. 

During the second quarter of 2023, we decided to temporarily pause active development activities associated with the Exterior Street Project, due to prevailing unfavorable economic and local market conditions and regulations, and therefore, ceased capitalization of interest and other carrying costs. 

30 

Impairment Charge 

Because of continuing unfavorable economic and local market conditions, we determined during the third quarter of 2024 we would no longer pursue the development of the Exterior Street Project, but rather pursue other strategies with respect to it, including a sale. As a result of this change in strategy; we determined the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project was no longer fully recoverable and therefore, recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 16.6 million, (included in impairment charges on our consolidated statement of operations) during the third quarter of 2024 in order to reduce the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project to its estimated fair value of 78.8 million as of September 30, 2024. In estimating the fair value of the Exterior Street Project, we took into consideration a bona fide third-party offer obtained by an independent third-party broker. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Exterior Street Project was 78.8 million and 95.7 million, respectively, which is included in development projects on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Santa Monica Project 

We have a 50 joint venture ownership interest in the Santa Monica Joint Venture. The Santa Monica Joint Venture, which we consolidate, is between us and a related party. In March 2022, the Santa Monica Joint Venture originated a 49.0 million promissory note (the Santa Monica Note Receivable to a borrower (the Santa Monica Borrower ), which was collateralized by two development projects located in Santa Monica, California. The Santa Monica Note Receivable bore interest at SOFR + 7.00 , subject to a 7.15 floor. 

During the first quarter of 2023, the Santa Monica Joint Venture received a partial paydown of 14.0 million on the Santa Monica Note Receivable in exchange for the release of one of the development projects, which had been completed, from the underlying collateral pool. As a result, the remaining outstanding balance of the Santa Monica Note Receivable of 35.0 million was secured solely by the Santa Monica Project, which consists of a proposed multifamily residential project on land parcels located in Santa Monica, California. 

Due to financial difficulties, during the second quarter of 2023 the Santa Monica Borrower discontinued making monthly interest payments on the Santa Monica Note Receivable, which subsequently matured on August 31, 2023. On December 29, 2023, ownership of the Santa Monica Project was transferred to the Santa Monica Joint Venture via a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction. In connection with the transfer, the outstanding principal and accrued interest for the Santa Monica Note Receivable of 36.7 million, which represented the fair value of the Santa Monica Project and approximated the carrying value of the Santa Monica Note Receivable, was reclassified from notes receivable, net to development projects on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Impairment Charge 

Subsequent
to obtaining ownership of the Santa Monica Project, the Santa Monica Joint Venture decided to continue certain pre-development
activities, which had already been started by the former owner. However, during the third quarter of 2024, the Santa Monica Joint
Venture decided to no longer pursue development of the Santa Monica Project, but rather pursue various other strategies with respect
to it, including a sale or the potential transfer of ownership to the lender, which had provided a non-recourse mortgage loan (the
 Santa Monica Loan ), collateralized by the Santa Monica Project As a result of the change in strategy, the Santa Monica
Joint Venture determined the carrying value of the Santa Monica Project was no longer fully recoverable and therefore, recorded a
non-cash impairment charge of 17.7 million (which is included in impairment charges on our consolidated statement of operations)
during the third quarter of 2024 in order to reduce the carrying value of the Santa Monica Project to its estimated fair value of
 19.0 million as of September 30, 2024. In estimating the fair value of the Santa Monica Project, the Santa Monica Joint
Venture used the value provided by an independent, third-party commercial real estate advisory and services firm. 

31 

On October 15, 2024 the Santa Monica Loan matured and it was not repaid, which constitutes a maturity event of default and therefore, it is due on demand. On October 30, 2024, the lender issued a formal notice of default and on October 31, 2024, the Santa Monica Joint Venture notified the lender of its intent to transfer ownership of the underlying collateral, the Santa Monica Project, to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction. See Note7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Santa Monica Project was 19.0 million and 36.7 million, respectively, which is included in development projects on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Land Parcels 

We wholly own certain land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida. 

During the first quarter of 2023, we completed the disposition of one of our land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida to an unrelated third-party for a contractual sales price of 1.5 million and recognized a gain on disposition of real estate of 1.1 million. During the second quarter of 2024, we completed the disposition of two more of our land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida, each to an unrelated third-party, for an aggregate contractual sales price of 15.4 million and recognized an aggregate gain on disposition of real estate of 10.9 million. During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the sale of certain municipal impact fee credits, which were attributable to the development of our former outlet center located in St. Augustine, Florida, which was substantially demolished during 2022, to an unrelated third-party for a contractual sales price of 2.7 million and recognized a gain on disposition of real estate of 2.7 million. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying value of our land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida was 2.1 million and 6.0 million, respectively, which is included in land and land improvements on the consolidated balance sheets.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded negative mark to market adjustments of 62 and 1.1 million, respectively. 

Gain on disposition of real estate 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate gain on the disposition of real estate of 13.6 million consisting of (i) a third quarter of 2024 gain of 2.7 million from the sale of certain municipal impact fee credits, which were attributable to the development of our former outlet center located in St. Augustine, Florida and (ii) the second quarter of 2024 aggregate gain of 10.9 million from the sales of two of our land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida. 

During the first quarter of 2023, we recognized a gain on the disposition of real estate of 1.1 million related to the sale of one of our parcels of land located in St. Augustine, Florida. 

Loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entity 

Our loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated entity was 2.7 million and 3.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliated entity is attributable to our unconsolidated 19 joint venture ownership interest in the Columbus Joint Venture. 

Noncontrolling interests 

The net earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) parties that hold units in the Operating Partnership, (ii) the interest in PRO held by our Sponsor (see Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) the ownership interests in the 2nd Street Joint Venture held by our Sponsor and other affiliates and (iv) the ownership interest in the Santa Monica Joint Venture held by an affiliate of our Sponsor. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview: 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 27.0 million of cash on hand, 7.1 million of restricted cash and 41.0 million of marketable securities. We also have remaining availability, subject to certain conditions, on our mortgage debt collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. See Moxy Mortgage Loans for additional information. Additionally, we have the ability to make draws from a non-revolving line of credit (the Line of Credit ), subject to certain conditions, and a margin loan (the Margin Loan ). See Notes Payable Line of Credit and Notes Payable Margin Loan for additional information. We currently believe that these items along with revenues from our operating properties; and interest and dividend income earned on our cash and marketable securities; as well as proceeds received from the potential sales of our marketable securities and remaining land parcels located in St. Augustine, Florida will be sufficient to satisfy our expected cash requirements for at least 12 months from the date of filing this report, which primarily consist of our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service (excluding balloon payments due at maturity), capital expenditures, contributions to our unconsolidated affiliated entity (Columbus Joint Venture), redemptions and cancellations of Common Shares, and distributions to our shareholders, if any, required to maintain our status as a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds through selective asset dispositions, joint venture arrangements, new borrowings and/or refinancing of existing debt. 

37 

Our borrowings consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. We typically have obtained level payment financing, meaning that the amount of debt service payable would be substantially the same each year. As such, most of the mortgages on our properties provide for so-called balloon payments. 

Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300 of net assets in the absence of a justification showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300 of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. As of September 30, 2024, our total borrowings of 269.4 million represented 138 of net assets. 

Any future properties that we may acquire or investments we may make may be funded through a combination of borrowings, proceeds generated from the sale and redemption of our marketable securities, available for sale, and proceeds received from the selective disposition of our properties. These borrowings may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with debt, which will be on a non-recourse basis. This means that a lender s rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property owning entity. 

We may also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties or real estate-related assets. These lines of credit will be at prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital or permanent financing. Our Sponsor or its affiliates may guarantee the lines of credit although they will not be obligated to do so. We expect that such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor s affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition of a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us. 

We have various agreements, including an advisory agreement, with the Advisor to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by the Advisor and/or its affiliated entities. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent upon our Advisor and its affiliates to perform such services as provided in these agreements. 

In addition to meeting working capital needs and making distributions to our stockholders, if any, required to maintain our status as a REIT, our capital resources are used to make certain payments to our Advisor and its affiliates, including payments for asset acquisition fees and the reimbursement of acquisition related expense, development fees, construction management fees, leasing commissions, asset management fees, and property management fees (except for our hotel, which is managed by unrelated third party property managers). We also reimburse our Advisor and its affiliates for actual expenses it incurs for certain administrative and other services provided to us. During the first quarter of 2024, the Advisor agreed to allow us to temporarily defer the payment of asset management fees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 2.0 million and 0.5 million of asset management fees were owed to the advisor, which are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The advisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and our independent directors.

 Development fees and the reimbursement of development-related costs that we pay to the Advisor and its affiliates are capitalized and are included in the carrying value of the associated development project which are classified as development projects on the consolidated balance sheets until construction is substantially completed. Once construction is substantially completed these amounts are recorded as property operating expenses. 

Additionally, we may be required to make distributions on the SLP Units in the Operating Partnership held by Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, provided our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. In connection with our Offering, which terminated on October 10, 2008, Lightstone SLP, LLC purchased an aggregate of 30.0 million of SLP Units, at a cost of 100,000 per unit. These SLP Units, the purchase price of which will be repaid only after stockholders receive a stated preferred return and their net investment, may entitle Lightstone SLP, LLC to a portion of any regular distributions made by the Operating Partnership. However, any future distributions on the SLP Units will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no distributions were declared and paid on the SLP units. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, distributions of 0.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively, were declared and paid on the SLP units.

Santa Monica Loan 

On June 30, 2022, the Santa Monica Joint Venture obtained the Santa Monica Loan, a loan of up to 33.1 million which initially bore interest at SOFR + 3.50 . The Santa Monica Loan requires monthly interest-only payments with the outstanding principal balance due at its maturity date and was previously collateralized by the Santa Monica Note Receivable, which was issued by the Santa Monica Joint Venture. During the first quarter of 2023, the Santa Monica Joint Venture received a 14.0 million paydown on the Santa Monica Note Receivable, of which 11.3 million was used to make a paydown on the Santa Monica Loan, which reduced its outstanding balance to 21.5 million. The Santa Monica Loan was initially scheduled to mature on December 30, 2023, however, on September 5, 2023, the Santa Monica Joint Venture exercised an option to extend its maturity date to February 29, 2024. In connection with this extension, the Santa Monica Joint Venture made an additional principal paydown of 2.1 million, which reduced the outstanding balance of the Santa Monica Loan to 19.5 million. Additionally, the Santa Monica Joint Venture funded 0.9 million into a cash collateral reserve account to cover the interest payments through February 29, 2024. 

40 

In connection with the transfer of ownership of the Santa Monica Project to the Santa Monica Joint Venture on December 29, 2023, the Santa Monica Loan was modified to substitute the Santa Monica Project as the underlying collateral. Subsequently, in March 2024, the Santa Monica Loan was again modified pursuant to which the interest rate was changed to SOFR + 4.5 , subject to a floor of 7.5 , the maturity date was changed to August 31, 2024 and the interest reserve was replenished to cover the payments due through August 31, 2024. On September 5, 2024, the Santa Monica Loan was further extended to October 15, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Santa Monica Loan was 19.5 million. 

On October 15, 2024, the Santa Monica Loan matured and it was not repaid, which constitutes a maturity event of default and therefore, it is due on demand. On October 30, 2024, the lender issued a formal notice of default and on October 31, 2024, the Santa Monica Joint Venture notified the lender of its intent to transfer ownership of the underlying collateral, the Santa Monica Project, to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction. 

Moxy Mortgage Loans 

On November 29, 2023, we entered into a mortgage loan facility (the Moxy Senior Loan with an unrelated third party providing for up to 110.0 million. At closing, 106.1 million of proceeds were advanced under the Moxy Senior Loan and the remaining availability of 3.9 million could only be drawn to cover operating losses, subject to various conditions. The Moxy Senior Loan bears interest at SOFR plus 4.00 , subject to a 7.50 floor, and initially matures on December 1, 2026, with two one-year extension options subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Senior Loan and remaining availability were 108.5 million and 1.5 million. 

Simultaneously on November 29, 2023, we also entered into a mortgage loan facility (the Moxy Junior Loan and together with the Moxy Senior Loan, the Moxy Mortgage Loans with an unrelated third party providing for up to 31.3 million. At closing, 30.2 million of proceeds were advanced under the Moxy Junior Loan and the remaining availability of 1.1 million could only be drawn for operating losses, subject to various conditions. The Moxy Junior Loan bears interest at SOFR plus 8.75 , subject to a 12.25 floor, and initially matures on December 1, 2026, with two one-year extension options subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Junior Loan and remaining availability were 30.9 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 

The Moxy Mortgage Loans require monthly interest-only payments through their maturity dates and are collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel, however, the Moxy Junior Loan is subordinate to the Moxy Senior Loan. Aggregate proceeds of 130.0 million advanced at the closing of the Moxy Mortgage Loans were used to repay in full existing construction mortgage indebtedness, which was collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Moxy Mortgage Loans, we are required to enter into two interest rate cap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 141.3 million (equal to the total maximum amounts available under the Moxy Senior Loan and the Moxy Junior Loan) for as long as the Moxy Mortgage Loans remain outstanding. On November 29, 2023, we entered into two interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts of 110.0 million and 31.3 million 141.3 million in the aggregate) pursuant to which the SOFR rate is capped at 5.50 through December 1, 2024 and June 1, 2025 for the Moxy Junior Loan and the Moxy Senior Loan, respectively, at an aggregate cost of 0.2 million. 

In connection with obtaining the Moxy Mortgage Loans, we provided certain interest and carry costs guarantees and paid 4.1 million of loan fees and expenses. 

41 

Exterior Street Loans 

On March 29, 2019, we obtained a 35.0 million loan (the Exterior Street Loan from a financial institution which, commencing on October 10, 2020, bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.25 through November 24, 2022. On December 21, 2021, the loan agreement was amended to provide an additional 7.0 million loan (the Exterior Street Supplemental Loan and collectively with the Exterior Street Loan, the Exterior Street Loans which bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.50 through November 24, 2022. The Exterior Street Loans require monthly interest-only payments with the outstanding principal balances due in full at their maturity date. The Exterior Street Loans are collateralized by the Exterior Street Project. 

On November 22, 2022, we and the financial institution entered into the second amendment to the Exterior Street Loans pursuant to which the interest rate on the Exterior Street Loans was adjusted to SOFR plus 2.60 and their maturity dates were extended to November 24, 2023. On October 31, 2023, we and the financial institution entered into an additional amendment to the Exterior Street Loans pursuant to which the interest rate on the Exterior Street Loans was adjusted to SOFR plus 2.85 (7.70 as of September 30, 2024) and their maturity date was further extended to November 24, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Exterior Street Loans was 42.0 million.

 These amounts represent future interest payments related to mortgage payable obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreement. All variable rate debt agreements are based on the one-month SOFR rate. For purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt the one-month SOFR rate, as applicable as of September 30, 2024 was used. 

Certain of our debt agreements require the maintenance of prescribed ratios, including debt service coverage. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all our financial covenants. Additionally, certain of our mortgages payable also contain clauses providing for prepayment penalties. 

Mortgage Debt Maturities 

The Santa Monica Loan (outstanding principal balance of 19.5 million as of September 30, 2024) matured on October 14, 2024 and was not repaid, which constitutes an event of default and therefore, it is due on demand. The Santa Monica Joint Venture currently intends to transfer ownership of the underlying collateral, the Santa Monica Project, to the lender via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction. 

Additionally, we have certain other mortgage debt that matures within 12 months of the date of these consolidated financial statements as discussed below. 

The mortgage loan collateralized by Gantry Park Landing (the Gantry Park Mortgage Loan (outstanding principal balance of 65.6 million as of September 30, 2024) is scheduled to mature on December 1, 2024. We currently intend to seek to extend or refinance the Gantry Park Mortgage Loan on or before its scheduled maturity date. 

42 

The Exterior Street Loans (outstanding principal balance of 42.0 million as of September 30, 2024) are scheduled to mature on November 24, 2024. We currently intend to seek to extend the Exterior Street Loans on or before their scheduled maturity date. 

However, if we are unable to extend or refinance these maturing mortgage loans at favorable terms, we will look to repay the then outstanding balance with available cash and/or proceeds from selective asset sales. We have no additional significant maturities of mortgage debt over the next 12 months. 

Notes Payable 

Margin Loan 

We have access to the Margin Loan from a financial institution that holds custody of certain of our marketable securities. The Margin Loan, which is due on demand, bears interest at SOFR plus 0.85 (5.70 as of September 30, 2024) and is collateralized by the marketable securities in our account. The amounts available to us under the Margin Loan are at the discretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in our account. There were no amounts outstanding under the Margin Loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Line of Credit 

We have a Line of Credit with a financial institution that provides for borrowings up to a maximum of 20.0 million, subject to a 55 loan-to-value ratio based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, which matures on November 30, 2024 and bears interest at SOFR plus 1.35 (6.20 as of September 30, 2024). The Line of Credit is collateralized by an aggregate of 187,019 of Marco OP Units and is guaranteed by PRO. 

As of September 30, 2024, the amount of borrowings available to be drawn under the Line of Credit was 17.4 million of which the outstanding principal balance of the Line of Credit was 3.0 million which is presented, net of deferred financing fees of 1, on the consolidated balance sheets and is classified as notes payable, net. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of borrowings available to be drawn under the Line of Credit was 14.7 million and no amounts were outstanding. 

We currently intend to seek to extend the Line of Credit on or before its scheduled maturity date. However, if we are unable to extend the Line of Credit, we will repay it in full with available cash on hand. 

Distributions 

Common Shares 

On November 10, 2023, the Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly distributions. 

Future distributions, if any, declared will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. The Board of Directors will consider various factors in its determination, including but not limited to, the sources and availability of capital, operating and interest expenses, our ability to refinance near-term debt, as well as the IRS s annual distribution requirement that REITs distribute no less than 90 of their taxable income. We cannot assure that any future distributions will be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have previously established or may establish. 

SRP 

Our share repurchase program (the SRP may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their Common Shares back to us, subject to restrictions. 

On March 25, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension of all redemptions. 

43 

Effective March 15, 2021 and May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as set forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder s death and hardship, respectively, and set the price for all such purchases to our current estimated net asset value per share of common stock NAV per Share ), as determined by the Board of Directors and reported by us from time to time. Deaths that occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 were eligible for consideration, subject to certain conditions. Beginning January 1, 2022, requests for redemptions in connection with a stockholder s death must be submitted and received by us within one year of the stockholder s date of death for consideration. On March 18, 2022, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the annual threshold for death redemptions from up to 0.5 to 1.0 . 

At the above noted dates, the Board of Directors established that on an annual basis, we would not redeem in excess of 1.0 and 0.5 of the number of shares outstanding as of the end of the preceding year for either death or hardship redemptions, respectively. Additionally, redemption requests are expected to be processed on a quarterly basis and would be subject to pro ration if either type of redemption requests exceeded the annual limitation. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 243,754 Common Shares at a weighted average price per share of 11.88.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 201,195 Common Shares at a weighted average price per share
of 12.19. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 

Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations FFO ), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition. 

We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management and reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 

Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 

44 

Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA ), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations MFFO ), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses (which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to straight line rent receivables and amortization of market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments and borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale), gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. 

We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 

Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 

Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

Notes : 

(1) 
 Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they are nonrecurring items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflects unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions. Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable equity securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for. The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly and/or annual basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 (2) 
 Management believes that adjusting for gains or losses related to extinguishment/sale of debt, derivatives or securities holdings is appropriate because they are items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations. By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods. 
 
 (3) 
 Under GAAP, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon, and as of the date of the evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no material weaknesses identified in the evaluation, and therefore, no corrective actions were taken. 

47 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION: 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to legal proceedings, claims or disputes. 

Various claims have been asserted against the 2 nd Street Joint Venture, including that the rents at Gantry Park Landing have been in excess of the lawfully allowable amounts. While any dispute has an element of uncertainty, the 2 nd Street Joint Venture currently believes that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome with respect to these matters is remote and therefore, no provision for loss has been recorded in connection therewith. 

Other the aforementioned matter, the Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings of which the outcome is probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition, which would require accrual or disclosure of the contingency and possible range of loss. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable.
