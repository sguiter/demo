CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Some of the statements contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, will, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

our market opportunity; 

our ability to maintain the listing of the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the potential liquidity and trading of such securities; 

our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our de-SPAC transaction completed in November 2023, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, our ability to grow and manage growth profitably and retain our key employees; 

our business development efforts to maximize our potential value and to retain and expand our customer base; 

our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our financial performance; 

our ability to continue as a going concern; 

the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; 

our success in retaining or recruiting officers, key employees or directors, or any necessary changes to these positions; 

changes in applicable laws or regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions; 

our ability to develop and maintain effective internal controls; 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy; 

general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflicts, pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, recessions, interest rates, inflation, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters; and 

other factors discussed in this report. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties may be amplified in the future and there may be additional risks that we currently consider immaterial, or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands of United States dollars except share and per share amounts) 

 (Unaudited) 

of the issued and outstanding shares of AARK and the Former AARK Sole Shareholder of AARK owning the balance . Pursuant to the Business Combination, ATI has a right to appoint two out of the three directors on the board of directors of AARK and therefore has an ability to control the activities undertaken by AARK in ordinary course of business, resulting in AARK being classified as a subsidiary of ATI. Finally, the Business Combination has been accounted for as reverse recapitalization. Refer to the section Reverse Recapitalization below for details. 

Reverse Recapitalization 

As mentioned above Business Combination , the Business Combination was closed on November 6, 2023 and has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization because AARK has been determined to be the accounting acquirer under ASC 805 based on the evaluation of the following facts and circumstances taken into consideration: 

The Former AARK Sole Shareholder, who controlled AARK prior to the Business Combination, will retain a majority of the outstanding shares of ATI after giving effect to the Exchange Agreements. The Exchange Agreements are further discussed in Note 10; 

AARK has the ability to elect a majority of the members of ATI s governing body; 

AARK s executive team makes up the executive team of ATI; 

AARK represents an operating entity (group) with operating assets, revenues, and earnings significantly larger than WWAC. 

Under a reverse recapitalization, while ATI was the legal acquirer, it has been treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of pre-combination AARK issuing stock for the net assets of ATI, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of ATI have been stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of pre-combination AARK and relate to the management consulting business. 

Immediately following the Business Combination, there were Class A ordinary shares outstanding with a par value of . Additionally, there were Private Placement Warrants (defined below) and Public Warrants (defined below) outstanding with a right to purchase Class A ordinary shares. 

Upon closing of the Business Combination, the total number of ATI s Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding was . Further, certain Class A ordinary shareholders entered into non-redemption agreements executed on November 3, 2023 and November 5, 2023, to reverse redemptions for an aggregate of 1,652,892 Class A ordinary shares while waiving their right to receive any Bonus Shares issued under the Merger Agreement. In connection with the closing, holders of Class A ordinary shares of ATI were redeemed at a price per share of approximately 10.69. AARK incurred approximately in transaction costs relating to the Business Combination and recorded those costs against additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The number of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination were: 

Shares held by Worldwide Webb Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor and other initial holders (2)(3) 

Shares held by Innovo Consultancy DMCC (4) 

Shares held by FPA (as defined below) Holders (5) 

Total (6)

As a result of the Business Combination, the Company s Class A ordinary shares trade under the ticker symbol AERT and its public warrants (the Public Warrants trade under the ticker symbol AERTW on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company s Class A ordinary shares were traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol WWAC. 

. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of , primarily due to current liabilities related to the FPAs entered into on November 3, 2023 and November 5, 2023. These FPAs were liquidity arrangements entered into as part of the business combination of the Company with WWAC effective as of November 6, 2023. Under these liquidity arrangements, certain investors agreed not to redeem their holdings in WWAC in exchange for the Company entering into the FPAs. This step was taken to address the agreed minimum cash requirement with WWAC as of the closing date of the business combination, which WWAC was unable to meet without this financing. Pursuant to the FPAs, the Company is obligated to pay a maturity consideration of at the end of the one-year term, which may be settled either in cash or equity at the option of the FPA holders. As of the date of this Form 10-Q report, the remaining balance owed to the FPA holders is . 

The Company received a
 non-renewal notice from a significant customer related to its dedicated offshore operations managed by the Company, which is
 expected to result in an annual revenue loss of approximately . 

The Company has historically financed its operations and expansions primarily with cash generated from operations and the revolving credit
facility from Kotak Mahindra Bank. As at September 30, 2024 the Company had a balance of 
in cash and cash equivalents and also generated overall positive cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also
reported a net operating cash inflow of 205 for this period. Management expects to have sufficient cash from the operations, cash reserves
and debt capacity for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future to finance our operations, our growth, expansion plans. However,
this expectation assumes that the FPA liabilities will not require immediate cash settlement. If an immediate cash settlement is required
for the remaining FPA liabilities, the Company may lack the necessary financial resources to sustain operations during this period. 

The Company has undertaken or completed the following actions to improve its available cash balances, liquidity, and cash generated from operations: 

The non-renewal of the customer contract requires a one-time buy-out payment from the customer to us of approximately . The Company has also executed a Master Service Agreement to provide technology-enabled services to the customer under a new engagement model and plans to expand operations under this arrangement. 

On November 6, 2024, the Company and one of the FPA holders, namely Meteora Capital Partners LP, which holds shares under its FPA, agreed to settle the liability through issuance of shares, leaving a remaining balance of owed to other FPA holders. We are actively pursuing capital raising alternatives to pay the remaining balance due. 

Targeted cost cutting measures have been instituted, focusing on non-core expenses including those related to inorganic growth strategy,
such as reductions in the use of outside vendors and professional services, as well as selective headcount and salary reduction and salary
reductions, which are designed to improve our cashflow position without impacting core business operations. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon, among other things, successfully executing its mitigation plan, which includes, (i) raising additional funds
from existing or new credit facilities, (ii) raising equity or equity linked capital, (iii) restructuring current liabilities into equity
or long-term obligations, and (iv) further reducing non-core expenses with a renewed focus on organic growth in the core geography that
has been historically operated in, which is North America. 

The Company is hopeful of accomplishing its objectives through these measures in the anticipated time frame and also expects that the funds available through the above-mentioned arrangements will be sufficient to alleviate the doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, there is no guarantee of the success of these efforts. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Class A ordinary shares to the FPA holders at the redemption price (i.e., 10.69 per share) and, purchase of Recycled Shares through redemption reversals. The amount to be received by ATI from the FPA holders on such issuance of around 3,711,667, shares, are held with the FPA holders as prepaid with respect to the forward transaction. Pursuant to the FPA, ATI was obligated to pay a prepayment amount of which was settled as below: 

against the consideration receivable by ATI for a new issuance of Class A ordinary shares to the FPA holders; and 

representing the cash paid by ATI to the FPA holders to fund the purchase price of the Recycled Shares. 

At the end of the contract period of one year, for each unsold share held by the FPA holders, ATI is obligated to pay FPA holders an amount of in cash or a variable number of ATI s Class A ordinary shares in order to provide a return of per FPA share determined based on the 30-day volume weighted average price of ATI s Class A ordinary shares Maturity Consideration ). The FPA holders have the option to select the form of Maturity Consideration. 

The Optional Termination Right held by the FPA holders economically results in the prepaid forward contract being akin to a written put option with the FPA holders right to sell all or a portion of the Class A ordinary shares to ATI. ATI is entitled over the 12-month maturity period to either a return of the prepayment or the underlying shares, which the FPA holders will determine at their sole discretion depending on the movement in ATI s stock price. 

On April 8, 2024, the Company completed a Private Investment in Public Equity PIPE transaction, with the Class A ordinary shares quoted at approximately 2.21 per share at that time. The Company has Forward Purchase Agreements with Sandia Investment Management LP, Sea Otter Trading, LLC, YA II PN, Ltd, and Meteora Capital Partners, LP (collectively, the FPA Holders ). These agreements contain a price reset feature that allows for adjustments to the share price based on certain predefined conditions, including those triggered by the PIPE transaction. As of the reporting date, this price reset feature was activated, resulting in a new share price of 2.21 per share for the over-the-counter (OTC) Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction. 

This adjustment has implications for the fair value of the derivative liability initially recorded on the balance sheet. Future fluctuations in this fair value will be recognized in earnings. For more details, please refer to Note 14: Fair Value Measurement 

The FPAs consist of two freestanding financial instruments that are accounted for as follows: 

1) 
 The total prepayment of 42,760 Prepayment Amount which includes a net cash outflow of 3,083 as discussed above. The Prepayment Amount has been accounted for as a reduction to equity to reflect the substance of the overall arrangement as a net repurchase of the Recycled Shares and sale of newly issued shares to the FPA holders pursuant to a subscription agreement without receipt of the underlying consideration of 39,678. 

2) 
 The FPA Put Option includes both the in-substance written put option and the expected Maturity Consideration.

If the volume weighted average price VWAP of the Class A ordinary shares over the three trading days immediately preceding the agreement date is higher than the VWAP over the three trading days immediately preceding the six-month anniversary from the agreement date, additional Class A ordinary shares of ATI would need to be issued for the difference. This represents a derivative financial instrument written by the Company which has been accounted for in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 including subsequent re-measurement at fair value with the changes being recognized in Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value at inception and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as current or noncurrent based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The Company is required to settle its liabilities under the FPAs by November 6, 2024.

The Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the grant date is affected by the estimated underlying share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. The grant date fair value of the Company s stock options granted to employees were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Indemnification obligations 

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These obligations typically arise in contracts where the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants for certain matters, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, data privacy violations, and certain tortious conduct in the course of providing services. The duration of these indemnifications varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. 

The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances of each agreement and the fact that certain indemnifications provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under the indemnification. Management is not aware of any such matters that would have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in proceedings and litigation, claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, nonmonetary sanctions, or relief. Management is not currently aware of any material pending legal proceedings, except for ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, in which we or any of our subsidiaries are involved, or where our property is subject to such proceedings.

In September 2024, the Company issued Class A ordinary shares and Class A ordinary shares, each valued on the relevant dates of the respective agreements, to two separate vendors, as compensation for their respective services. 

Redeemable noncontrolling interest 

As of September 30, 2024, the prior investors of AARK owns of the ordinary shares of AARK, and prior investors of ATGBA owned of the ordinary shares of ATGBA. The prior investors of AARK and ATGBA have the right to exchange their AARK or ATGBA ordinary shares for Class A ordinary shares of the Company based on the exchange ratio as set out in the Exchange Agreements details of which are set out in Note 10 or cash proceeds based on the VWAP for each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the exchange date, but only if the approval from the Reserve Bank of India or other regulatory approvals are not obtained and subject to other conditions specified in the Exchange Agreements. The exchange is also subject to certain other specified conditions being met, including achieving certain financial and stock price milestones. Given that this is not solely in control of ATI, the noncontrolling interests have been accounted for in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-1. The redeemable noncontrolling interest has initially been measured at the proportionate share in the net assets of AARK and its subsidiaries in accordance with ASC 805-40-30-3. The cash redemption is not considered to be probable on September 30, 2024 because the specified conditions in relation to EBITDA and revenue have already been met and the Reserve Bank of India and / or applicable regulatory approvals are expected to be received. On this basis the redeemable noncontrolling interest has subsequently been measured by attributing the net income/ loss of AARK pursuant to ASC 810-10.

We support and drive our clients global growth by providing a range of services, including professional advisory services and operations management services, to build and manage GCCs in suitable and cost-effective locations based on client business needs. With a focus towards digital enterprise enablement, these GCCs are designed to act as seamless extensions of the client organization, providing access to top-tier resources. We believe this empowers our clients to remain competitive and nimble and to achieve their goals of enduring cost efficiencies, operational excellence, and value creation, without sacrificing functional control and flexibility.

As of September 30, 2024, Aeries had more than 30 clients spanning across industry segments, including companies in the industries of e-commerce, telecom, security, healthcare, engineering and others. 

Key Factors Affecting Performance and Comparability 

Market Opportunity 

Our current markets are North America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, with a primary focus on the United States. Within these regions we are focused on two primary areas, the private equity ecosystem and the mid-market enterprises. 

Companies are looking out for service providers who not only have the experience and expertise in providing the right-sized solution in this age of ever shortening business cycles but also a trusted partner with a transparent engagement model to lead the customers through the digital transformation journey. Aeries model is purpose-built to provide this experience, expertise and transparent engagement model to accelerate and enhance our clients businesses. 

Private Markets 

As private market investing evolves and the landscape of venture-backed and late-stage private growth companies transforms, our service offerings will adapt accordingly, aligning with the shifting dynamics of potential investors and portfolio companies seeking our expertise. While periods of macroeconomic growth in the United States, particularly in private equity markets, typically foster an upsurge in overall investment activity, any economic slowdowns, downturns, or volatility in the broader market and private equity landscape could potentially dampen this growth momentum. 

Macro-economic headwinds 

Our operational performance is influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary climate, and business sentiment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, including concerns over wage inflation, the potential of decelerating global economic growth, and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. These factors have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations. 

Customer Retention and Early Termination of Long-Term Contracts 

Maintaining long-term customer relationships is important to our business, as a significant portion of our revenue is derived from these contracts. Although we have auto-renewal service agreements with clients, they may choose to terminate or not renew, in which case they must provide a notice period, typically ranging from 90 to 180 days, and pay a termination fee based on the commercial margin if termination occurs without cause. There is an increasing likelihood that clients may choose to terminate our service agreements after we have established and operated delivery centers for them, as it becomes more feasible and cost-efficient for them to take over. While the above-described contractual provisions provide some financial protection, the termination fee may not fully offset the long-term revenue loss, and replacing clients can be challenging due to the lengthy customer acquisition cycle. To mitigate this risk, we focus on maintaining strong relationships, expanding our customer base, diversifying service offerings, and delivering high-quality service to encourage renewals or alternative service arrangements when terminations occur. Our operational results and financial condition may still be negatively affected if multiple key customers terminate their agreements around the same time, as replacing this revenue can take time. 

30 

Income Taxes 

We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and have operations in India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. Our effective tax rate has historically varied and will continue to vary from year to year based on the tax rate in the jurisdiction of our organization, the geographical sources of our earnings and the tax rates in those countries, the tax relief and incentives available to us, the financing and tax planning strategies employed by us, changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof, and movements in our tax reserves, if any. 

Currently, the Company is liable to pay income tax in India, Mexico, Singapore, and the United States. In India, the Company has chosen to pay taxes according to the newly introduced tax regime in 2019 while forgoing some exemptions and deductions. Consequently, the Company calculates its consolidated provision for income taxes based on the asset and liability method. This involves determining deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the condensed consolidated financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which these temporary differences are anticipated to be settled or recovered. If there is evidence that indicates some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, the deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions to determine if they are likely to be sustained upon examination, and a liability is recorded when such uncertainties fail to meet the more likely than not threshold. 

Financing Costs 

We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt obligations. We have historically used short and long-term debt to finance our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other investments. In May 2023, Aeries amended its revolving credit facility Amended Credit Facility ), whereby the total borrowing capacity was increased to 3.8 million (at the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2024), with Kotak Mahindra Bank. The revolving facility is available for Aeries operational requirements. The interest rate is equal to the 6 months Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate MCLR plus a margin of 0.80 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Aeries is required to pay interest on the outstanding balance of the credit facility at this financing cost basis, calculated based on the actual number of days for which the funds are utilized. Any changes in the prevailing MCLR rates and the interest rate charged by the bank will affect the financing cost basis and the overall cost of borrowing. 

Aeries also has an outstanding unsecured loan from director of Aeries Technology Group Business Accelerators Pvt Ltd., Mr. Vaibhav Rao, amounting to 0.8 million at an interest rate of 10 per annum. The principal amount of the loan was outstanding in entirety as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and year ended March 31, 2024. 

On December 7, 2022, the Company entered into a vehicle loan, secured by the vehicle, for INR 11.5 (or approximately 0.1 at the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2024) at 10.75 from Mercedes-Benz Financial Services India Pvt. Ltd. The Company is required to repay the loan in 48 monthly instalments beginning January 4, 2023. 

On August 2, 2024, the Company entered into a vehicle loan, secured by the vehicle, for INR 8.2 (or approximately 0.1 at the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2024) at 10.25 from Mercedes-Benz Financial Services India Pvt. Ltd. The Company is required to repay the loan in 48 monthly instalments beginning September 4, 2024. 

Refer to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements titled Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our indebtedness.

Revenue, net 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by 0.7 million or 4 , to 16.9 million from 17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We experienced revenue growth of 4.6 million primarily due to the addition of new clients and increase in business from existing clients, which was offset by a 5.4 million decrease in revenue due to the ramp-down in our existing client engagements and the completion and closure of certain consulting projects. 

Cost of Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenue increased by 0.6 million or 4 , to 13.3 million from 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase included a 1.6 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, including bonuses and a 0.8 million increase in administrative cost, rent and legal professional fees. These cost increases were offset by a 1.9 million decrease in cost related to fees to external consultants. 

Gross Profit 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit decreased by 1.2 million or 26 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower gross profit was primarily due to decline in revenue showing 0.7 million decrease, against increase of 0.5 million in cost of revenue mainly due to the increased compensation costs and benefits offset by decrease in cost related to fees to external consultants. 

Gross Profit Margin 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit margin decreased by 2,600 basis points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to decrease in business from the project-based consulting business, which typically yield higher margins due to billing being based on fixed hourly rates. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 4.3 million, or 130 to 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This significant increase was primarily driven by a 2.5 million provision for expected credit loss on customer receivables. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits increased by 2.1 million due to new hires and salary adjustment for senior management, and travel expenses, offset by a 0.1 million reduction in fees to external consultants and a 0.2 million reduction in ESOP expense 

Total Other Income (expense), net 

Total other income / (expense), net was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to total other expense, net of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 1.2 million and 953 change primarily due to a change in the fair value of the forward purchase agreement put option liability. 

Income tax expenses / (benefit) 

Income tax expense/ (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was (0.5) million, a 1.2 million or 177 decrease compared to provision of income taxes of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to significant increase in recognition of deferred tax benefit on losses in certain subsidiaries having a lower jurisdictional tax rates along with a reduction in taxable income resulting in lower current tax.

Additionally, employee compensation and benefits increased by 3.2 million due to increased hiring, resulting in increased personnel related costs, and travel expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate the business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the categories of non-cash items, other than costs related to the Business Combination and transaction related costs, which represent non-recurring legal, professional, personnel and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with potential mergers and acquisitions related activities. We believe the non-GAAP measures presented herein should always be considered along with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the related US GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the US GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying US GAAP results throughout the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, business combination-related costs, and changes in fair value of derivative liabilities. 

We define Core Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA
less EBITDA from non-core business. Our core business includes GCC services provided to private equity-backed companies, primarily
in North America, characterized by long-term relationships, recurring contracts, and multi-year revenue streams. In contrast, our non-core
business includes consulting services, primarily for customers in the Middle East, which typically involve one-time engagements with extended
collection cycles. Moving forward, we aim for the majority of our revenue to be generated from our core business, and we do not plan to
enter into new customer contracts outside North America. 

35 

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the reporting period. 

Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our operating performance and in making financial, operating, and planning decisions. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful insight to investors by offering a clearer view of Aeries s operating performance. This information has been used by our management for internal reporting and planning procedures, including aspects of our consolidated operating budget and capital expenditures. 

The following table provides a reconciliation from
net income (US GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and six months ended September 30,

or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain/loss; (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; (iii) significant
interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt; (iv) payments made
or future requirements for income taxes; and (v) cash requirements for future replacement or payment in depreciated or amortized assets;
(vi) stock based compensation costs, (vii) Business Combination and transaction related costs, which represent non-recurring legal, professional,
personnel and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with potential mergers and acquisitions related activities for the three
and six months ended September 30, 2024, and Business Combination related costs for the three and six months related September 30,
2023, (viii) change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Additionally, the Core Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the provision for
expected credit loss / (profit) from non-core business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, certain conditions as listed below raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for this period: 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 17.6 million. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 9.8 million, primarily due to current liabilities related to the
FPAs entered into on November 3, 2023, and November 5, 2023. These FPAs were liquidity arrangements entered into as part of the business
combination of the Company with WWAC effective as of November 6, 2023. Under these liquidity arrangements, certain investors agreed not
to redeem their holdings in WWAC in exchange for the Company entering into the FPAs. This step was taken to address the agreed minimum
cash requirement with WWAC as of the closing date of the business combination, which WWAC was unable to meet without this financing. Pursuant
to the FPAs, the Company is obligated to pay a maturity consideration of 8 million at the end of the one-year term, which may be settled
either in cash or equity at the option of the FPA holders. As of the date of this Form 10-Q report, the remaining balance owed to the
FPA holders is 7.5 million. We do not have sufficient cash from operations or cash reserves to pay the maturity consideration in cash.
Paying the maturity consideration in cash would reduce the amount of cash on hand or available debt capacity to fund our operations, which
could adversely affect our ability to make necessary investments, and, therefore, could affect our results of operations. 

The Company received a non-renewal notice from a significant customer related to its dedicated offshore operations managed by the Company,
which is expected to result in an annual revenue loss of approximately 11.5 million. 

Our working capital needs are primarily to finance our payroll and other administrative and information technology expenses in advance of the receipt of accounts receivable, as well as increased expenses due to being a public reporting company. Our primary capital requirements include expanding existing operations to support our growth, financing acquisitions and enhancing capabilities, including building certain digital solutions. 

The Company has historically financed its operations
and expansions primarily with cash generated from operations and the revolving credit facility from Kotak Mahindra Bank. As at September 30,
2024, the Company had a balance of 3.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, and also generated overall positive cash flows for the six
months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported a net operating cash inflow of 0.2 million for this period. Management expects
to have sufficient cash from the operations, cash reserves and debt capacity for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future to
finance our operations, growth, expansion plans. However, this expectation assumes that the FPA liabilities will not require immediate
cash settlement. If an immediate cash settlement is required for the remaining FPA liabilities, the Company may lack the necessary financial
resources to sustain operations during this period. 

The Company has undertaken or completed the following actions to improve its available cash balances, liquidity, and cash generated from operations: 

The non-renewal of the customer contract requires a one-time buyout payment from the customer to us of approximately 3.1 million. 

On November 6, 2024, the Company and one of the FPA holders, Meteora Capital Partners, LP, which holds 250,000 shares under its FPA, agreed to settle the liability through the issuance of shares, leaving a remaining balance of 7.5 million owed to other FPA holders. We are actively pursuing capital raising alternatives to pay the remaining balance due. 

Targeted cost cutting measures have been instituted, focusing on non-core expenses including those related to inorganic growth strategy,
such as reductions in the use of outside vendors and professional services, as well as selective headcount and salary reductions, which
are designed to improve our cash flow position without impacting core business operations. 

37 

The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon, among other things, successfully executing its mitigation plan, which includes (i) raising additional funds
from existing or new credit facilities, (ii) raising equity or equity linked capital, (iii) restructuring current liabilities into equity
or long-term obligations, and (iv) further reducing non-core expenses with a renewed focus on organic growth in the core geography we
historically operate in, which is North America. The Company is hopeful of accomplishing its objectives through these measures in the
anticipated time frame and also expects that the funds available through the above-mentioned arrangements will be sufficient to alleviate
the doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, there is no guarantee of the success of these efforts.

Analysis of Cash Flow Changes between the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating Activities - The 0.2 million net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a net loss (adjusted with non-cash adjustments) of 3.6 million as a result of higher cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses; partially offset by a 3.8 million increase in cash flow from better working capital management. 

Investing Activities - Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 million, of which 0.9 million was used for the purchase of property and equipment and 0.8 million was used for the issuance of loans to affiliates, offset by 0.8 million generated from loan repayments received from affiliates. 

Net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.8 million, of which 0.7 million was used for the purchase of property and equipment and 0.7 million was used for the issuance of loans to affiliates, offset by 0.7 million generated from loan repayments received from affiliates. 

Financing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million, primarily from proceeds of the PIPE transaction of 4.7 million, and proceeds from long-term debt of 0.9 million; offset by the repayment of short-term debt of 1.9 million, payment of insurance financing liability of 0.4 million and payment of finance lease obligation of 0.2 million. 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.2 million, primarily due to net proceeds from short-term borrowings of 1.2 million, proceeds from long-term debt of 0.5 million; partially offset by payment of deferred transaction costs of 1.4 million and payment of finance lease obligations and long-term debt of 0.2 million. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024 and currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, other than as disclosed in Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

New Accounting Pronouncements 

See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Application of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates 

General 

The following is a summary of the basis of preparation and significant accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements. A full description of significant accounting policies is provided in our consolidated carve-out financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our condensed consolidated financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe the current assumptions, judgments and estimates used to determine amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results may differ under different conditions. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this document. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates contained in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

On December 11, 2023, the Company concluded that it should restate certain of its previously issued carve-out consolidated financial statements of AARK and subsidiaries to correct the misreporting of basic and diluted earnings per share and number of issued and paid-up common stock, resulting from one of the material weaknesses described below. 

In connection with this restatement, our management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are primarily attributable to improper segregation of duties, inadequate processes for timely recording of significant events and material transactions, and inadequate design and implementation of information and communication policies, procedures, and monitoring activities. 

39 

Remediation Plan 

In light of these facts, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is in the process of implementing processes and controls and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described above, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with US GAAP. 

To address our material weaknesses, we are improving our processes of reviewing financial statements, increasing our communication with third-party service providers and implementing additional procedures to ensure that the review of the Company s financial statements is supported by sufficient documentation to determine accuracy. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

While management is working to remediate the material weaknesses, there is no assurance that these remediation efforts, when economically feasible and sustainable, will successfully remediate the identified material weaknesses. If we are unable to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our Class A ordinary shares could be materially and adversely affected and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Effective process and controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. For as long as we are a smaller reporting company under the U.S. securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our management s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 

Moreover, we do not expect that process and controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In light of the material weaknesses described above, we are taking the actions described above to remediate such material weaknesses. Except as described above, there was not any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

40 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may be involved in various proceedings and litigation, claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, nonmonetary sanctions, or relief. Management is not currently aware of any material pending legal proceedings, except for ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, in which we or any of our subsidiaries are involved, or where our property is subject to such proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Summary Risk Factors 

A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in the Risk Factors section of the 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as therein previously reported, except as noted below: 

We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, including obligations under the FPAs and the termination of a significant customer contract . 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations, management has identified conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 3.6 million with a net operating cash inflow of 0.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported a net loss of 17.6 million for this period. 

A key factor contributing to this uncertainty is the Company s obligation to settle its maturity liabilities under the FPAs by November 6, 2024. The total amount payable under these agreements is 8 million, which may be settled either in cash or equity at the discretion of the investors. In the absence of a clear and actionable plan for addressing this liability, there is a risk that the Company may lack sufficient funds to meet this obligation, further jeopardizing its financial stability. On November 6, 2024, the Company and one of the FPA holders agreed to settle the Company s FPA liability to this FPA holder in the amount of 0.6 million through the issuance of an additional 57,811 shares. However, other FPA holders have not agreed to accept shares or extend the maturity date, leaving a remaining potential cash liability of 7.5 million that may further strain the Company s financial condition and liquidity. 

The Company s financial condition is further impacted by a non-renewal notice received from a significant customer, expected to result in an annual revenue loss of approximately 11.5 million. While the customer s non-renewal requires a one-time buyout payment to the Company of approximately 3.1 million, this amount alone may not fully offset the anticipated revenue impact. 

Management s plans to address these challenges
include (i) raising additional funds through existing or new credit facilities, (ii) raising equity or equity-linked capital, (iii) restructuring
current liabilities into equity or long-term obligations, and (iv) further reducing non-core expenses with a renewed focus on organic
growth in the core geography we historically operate in, which is North America. There is no guarantee that these measures will be successful
or that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms. Any future equity financing could significantly dilute existing shareholders 
ownership. 

If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets, potentially at less than their carrying value, which could result in a substantial or complete loss of investor capital. Future SEC filings may also contain statements expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which could deter investors or other financing sources from providing funding on favorable terms, if at all. 

41 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
