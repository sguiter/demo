SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Exchange Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or future financial or operating performance and include all statements that are not historical facts such as information concerning the strategic alternatives considered by our Board of Directors, including the decisions taken thereto and alternatives for the use of the Post-Closing Cash, our possible or assumed future results of operations and expenses, management strategies and plans, competitive position, business environment, potential growth strategies and opportunities and our continued listing on Nasdaq. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by use of terms such as anticipates, assumption, believes, continue, could, estimates, expects, foresees, forecasts, intends, goals, judgment, may, might, outlook, plans, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, targets, will, would or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. 
 Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Those risks include those described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as in our condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed on May 8, 2024, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed on August 8, 2024, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 5, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The inclusion of forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us, our management or any other person that the future plans, estimates, or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the strategic alternatives considered by our Board of Directors, including the decisions taken thereto; future financial performance; our future liquidity and operating expenditures; financial condition and results of operations; competitive changes in the marketplace; the outcome of ongoing litigation; our expected tax rate; the effect of changes in or the application of new or revised tax laws; the effect of new accounting pronouncements; and other characterizations of future events or circumstances. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

CONTEXTLOGIC INC. 
 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Con solidated Financial Statements 
 in June 2010 and is headquartered in Oakland, California. Reverse Stock Split On April 10, 2023, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the Reverse Stock Split Amendment to the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's Class A common stock ("common stock"), which became effective on April 11, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock, which remains at billion, and did not change the par value of the common stock, which remains at per share. As a result of the Instead, to any holder who would have otherwise been entitled to receive a fractional share of common stock, the Company issued such holder an additional fractional share, such that, when combined with the fractional share otherwise issuable as a result of the reverse stock split, equaled a whole share of common stock.

(the Record Date ). Each Right entitles its holder, subject to the terms of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (as defined below) of the Company at an exercise price of per Right, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan. In connection with the adoption of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, on February 12, 2024, the Company filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Designation designating shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share Series A Preferred Stock ). The Company designated the Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Company s Board of Directors' approval of a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, as discussed above. The Company adopted the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in order to protect against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use the Company s net operating losses ("NOLs") and certain other tax attributes to reduce potential future U.S. federal income tax obligations. The NOLs and certain other tax attributes are valuable assets to the Company, which may inure to the benefit of the Company and its stockholders. However, if the Company experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), its ability to fully utilize the NOLs and certain other tax attributes will be substantially limited and the timing of the usage of the NOLs and other tax attributes could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of those assets. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the Company s stock owned by one or more of its 5-percent shareholders (as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholder or stockholders at any time over a three-year period. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to prevent such an ownership change by deterring any person or group, together with its affiliates and associates, from acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of the Company s outstanding common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, the Rights become exercisable and trade separately from the Company s common stock only upon the "Distribution Time", which occurs upon the earlier of: (i) the close of business on the tenth day after the Stock Acquisition Date (which is (a) the first date of public announcement that any person or group has become an Acquiring Person, which is defined as a person or group that, together with its affiliates and associates, beneficially owns or more of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (with certain exceptions, including those described below) or (b) such other date, as determined by the Company s Board of Directors, on which a person or group has become an Acquiring Person), or (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Company s Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. The Rights will expire on the earliest to occur of: (a) the close of business on February 10, 2027; (b) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged by the Company; (c) upon the closing of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving the Company pursuant to a merger or other acquisition agreement that has been approved by the Company s Board of Directors before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person; and (d) the time at which the Company s Board of Directors determines that the NOLs and certain other tax attributes are utilized in all material respects or that an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code would not adversely impact in any material respect the time period in which the Company could use the NOLs and other tax attributes or materially impair the amount of NOLs and other tax attributes that could be used by the Company in any particular time period, for applicable tax purposes.

Following the Asset Sale, the Company longer has any operating leases or related right-of-use assets, current lease liabilities, or non-current lease liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet included right-of-use assets of million, current lease liabilities in the amount of million in accrued liabilities , and million in lease liabilities, non-current.

million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Company also entered into letters of credit from time to time, which reduced its borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest on any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrued at either adjusted reference rate plus or at an alternative base rate plus , at the Company s election, and the Company was required to pay a commitment fee that accrued at per annum on the unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company was required to pay a fee that accrued at per annum on the average daily amount available to be drawn under any letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2024, the Company executed a letter to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility from an aggregate principal amount of million to million. The Revolving Credit Facility contained customary conditions to borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restricted the Company s ability (and the ability of certain of the Company s subsidiaries) to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make certain fundamental changes and asset sales, make distributions to stockholders, make investments or engage in transactions with affiliates. It also contained a minimum liquidity financial covenant of million, which included unrestricted cash and any available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility were secured by liens on substantially all of the Company s domestic assets and were guaranteed by any material domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. A standby letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") in the amount of approximately million was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility in conjunction with the lease of the Company s previous headquarters in San Francisco, California. Fees incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility were insignificant for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. At the closing of the Asset Sale on April 19, 2024, the Company terminated the Revolving Credit Facility. At that closing, the Letter of Credit ceased to be issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and was cash collateralized in equal amounts by the Company and the Buyer. Furthermore, the Company's previous headquarters was transferred to the Buyer, which has assumed the Company's obligations under the lease for those headquarters upon closing of the Asset Sale. Refer to Note 4 Asset Sale for additional information on Asset Sale. Purchase Obligations Prior to the Asset Sale, the Company entered into an amendment to a co-location and cloud services arrangement committing the Company to make payments of million for services over years effective September 1, 2022. Following the Asset Sale, the Company longer had this commitment as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4 Asset Sale for additional information on Asset Sale. The purchase obligations were assumed and thus were as of the Asset Sale. Legal Contingencies and Proceedings Beginning in May 2021, putative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company, its directors, certain of its officers and the underwriters named in its initial public offering IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws based on statements made in its registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC in connection with its IPO and seeking monetary damages. of these cases has since been dismissed by the plaintiff and the remaining have been coordinated and consolidated. In May 2022, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs, who subsequently filed an amended consolidated class action complaint pursuant to Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On April 10, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and asserted only claims made under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. In December 2023, the Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint. In February 2024, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, which the defendants have moved to dismiss. In August 2024, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without leave to amend and with prejudice. In September 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion to alter judgment noticed for hearing in January 2025. The Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend them. Based on the preliminary nature of the proceedings in these cases, the Company cannot estimate a range of potential losses at this point in time. In August 2021, a shareholder derivative action purportedly brought on behalf of the Company, Patel v. Szulczewski, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company s directors and officers made or caused the Company to make false and/or misleading statements about the Company s business operations and financial prospects in various public filings. Plaintiff asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act and is seeking monetary damages. This matter is currently stayed. The Company believes this lawsuit is without merit and it intends to vigorously defend it. Based on the preliminary nature of the proceedings in these cases, the Company cannot estimate a range of potential losses at this point in time.

Balances as of September 30, 2024 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock was zero and per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, shares remained available for grant under the Company s equity incentive plans. In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale, all outstanding equity awards became fully vested at the closing. CEO Transition In February 2023, the Board of Directors appointed Jun Yan as the Company's CEO, who was then serving as the Company's interim CEO. According to the terms of his new employment agreement, Mr. Yan was granted (i) million restricted stock units ("RSUs") with an aggregate grant date fair value of million and (ii) options to purchase million shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price per share with an aggregate grant date fair value of million. These RSUs and options became vested and exercisable, respectively, in periodic installments over a -year term, subject to the CEO's continued service with the Company. The option award originally had a term of years. In February 2024, the option award was amended so the option shares vested as of Mr. Yan's termination date on and will expire on the anniversary of the termination date on . In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale, all of Mr. Yan's outstanding equity awards were accelerated and became fully veste d at the closing. Stock Option Valuation The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into account inputs such as the exercise price, the value of the underlying shares as of the grant date, expected term, expected volatility, risk free interest rate, and dividend yield. The fair value of the options was determined using the methods and assumptions discussed below: The expected term of the options was determined using the simplified method as prescribed in the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the Company s lack of sufficient historical data. 

 The risk-free interest rate was based on the interest rate payable on the U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected term. 

 The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the publicly traded common stock of peer group companies blended with the limited historical volatility of the Company s own common stock weighted to reflect the short trading period of the Company s stock since its IPO in December 2020. 

 The expected dividend yield was zero because the Company has not historically paid and does not expect to pay a dividend on its ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.

Modification of Equity Awards In February 2024, the Company modified its outstanding stock options to extend the expiration date of any option vested as of the date of employment termination from a period to a period. The Company concluded that the extension of the expiration date of the stock options constituted a Type I modification. The stock-based compensation impact of the modification was insignificant. Further, in February 2024, the Board of Directors, as permitted by the terms of the Company's equity incentive plans, modified all outstanding restricted stock awards and options, to add a change-in-control provision whereby all unvested awards would become fully vested upon the occurrence of a change in control and extended the expiration date for a period of following termination. The impact of these modifications to stock-based compensation expense for the period ended September 30, 2024, was insignificant. Upon consummation of the Asset Sale, all options and RSUs then outstanding were accelerated, thus unrecognized expense remained for those equity awards as of September 30, 2024.

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in provision for income taxes was primarily due to withholding taxes accrued on certain intercompany dividends. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its domestic net deferred tax assets which is excluded from the annual effective tax rate estimate. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024. The Company had million of unrecognized benefits as of December 31, 2023. The interest and penalties associated with the unrecognized tax benefits were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state or other jurisdictions. All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss or credits. Certain tax years are subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities until the statute of limitations expire.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with (1) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and (2) the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). Unless otherwise indicated, all results presented are prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal period. Our discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All references to "we", "us", "our", or "ContextLogic" or the "Company" refer to ContextLogic Inc. 
 Asset Sale 
 On February 10, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement with Qoo10 Inc., a Delaware corporation Qoo10 Delaware ), and, for certain specified purposes, Qoo10 Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private limited company and Qoo10 Delaware s parent company Qoo10 ), pursuant to which (i) we agreed to sell substantially all of our assets to Qoo10 Delaware or an affiliate designated by Qoo10 Delaware (such designated affiliate, the Buyer ), other than (A) our net operating losses NOLs and certain other tax attributes, (B) our marketable securities and (C) certain of our cash and cash equivalents, and (ii) Qoo10 agreed to acquire those assets and assume substantially all of our liabilities as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Sale ). On April 18, 2024, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted to approve the Asset Sale. Pursuant to such vote and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, the Asset Sale closed on April 19, 2024, and immediately following the closing of the Asset Sale, we received/retained approximately 162 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (consisting of government securities)(the "Post-Closing Cash"), as well as the NOLs and other tax attributes described herein. 
 Following the completion of the Asset Sale, we have exited the operation of our marketplace and logistics business and other historical operations. However, we do not currently intend to liquidate. We are actively developing processes and procedures for evaluating strategic alternatives for the use of our Post-Closing Cash and reviewing, identifying and executing those strategic opportunities for the benefit of ContextLogic and its stockholders. Those alternatives are currently expected to include using the Post-Closing Cash to fund, at least in part, the acquisition of assets or a business that will potentially allow us to utilize and derive benefits from our NOLs and certain other tax attributes. 
 Overview 
 Prior to the completion of the Asset Sale, we were an marketplace and logistics business that connected merchants and consumers from around the world. Since the Asset Sale was consummated, as we pursue strategic opportunities, our primary source of income is interest earned on our marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. We also have retained a payment license in Europe that we still hold from two subsidiaries in the Netherlands pending approval of transfer to Qoo10 by the Dutch National Bank of certain licenses. Although our Board of Directors is evaluating various strategic alternatives regarding the use of the proceeds from the Asset Sale with a goal to maximize stockholder value, we have not yet identified any particular acquisitions or investments or committed to making any such decision by a particular date. We can provide no assurance that our Board of Directors and management will be able to attract the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control, or consummate strategic transactions, including the acquisition of assets or a business, on terms and conditions that we believe will be in the best interests of ContextLogic and its stockholders. The Company is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ICA ), and is not required to register as an investment company under the ICA.

 Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained steady at 6 million compared to the same periods in 2023. The 2024 provision was primarily related to withholding taxes accrued on certain intercompany dividends in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 while the 2023 provision was related to unrecognized tax benefits and our international operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 33 million, a majority of which were held in cash deposits and U.S. Treasury bills, and marketable securities of 117 million, which funds were held for working capital purposes. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our material cash requirements outside our normal operating costs include 5 million in total liabilities. 
 While we maintain our cash and short-term investments with a diverse group of large national financial institutions, there can be no assurance that any of our other deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As a result of the Asset Sale, we received/retained approximately 162 million in cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 33 million and marketable securities of 117 million (consisting of government securities). As required by the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer assumed substantially all the liabilities of the Company. 
 Since the consummation of the Asset Sale, we: (i) earn interest income on cash and marketable securities that we continue to hold following the Asset Sale; (ii) have no other sources of revenue and related costs; and (iii) incur minimal administrative costs.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 92 million. This was driven by our net loss of 73 million and 26 million unfavorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of 7 million. Unfavorable working capital movement was mainly driven by reductions in accounts payable, merchants payable and accrued and refund liabilities. Accounts payable, merchants payable, and accrued and refund liabilities decreased significantly due to the Asset Sale. 
 Net cash used in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 266 million. This was driven by our net loss of 249 million and 73 million unfavorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of 56 million. Unfavorable working capital movement was mainly driven by reductions in accounts payable, merchants payable and accrued and refund liabilities. Accounts payable, merchants payable, and accrued and refund liabilities decreased by 92 million primarily due to lower order volumes and reduced digital advertising expenditures. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 103 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily due to 133 million net cash proceeds from the Asset Sale and 120 million in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by 150 million in maturities and sales of marketable securities. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to 317 million in maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by 239 million in purchases of marketable securities and 3 million in capital expenditures. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in our financing activities was 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in each case, due to tax payments related to employee RSU settlement. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had two unconsolidated entities in the Netherlands remaining from the Asset Sale. These two entities hold and manage a payment license in Europe and are pending approval of transfer to Qoo10 by the Dutch National Bank. We do not retain any economic benefits from these entities and thus do not consolidate them into our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in our 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024.

 As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), with assistance from other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and based on their evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, described below. 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures within our 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024, the following material weaknesses were identified and remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024: 
 The Company did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, the Company did not (i) provide sufficient management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process or (ii) hire and train sufficient competent personnel to support the Company s internal control objectives. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weakness: 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls ITGCs for information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain: (i) sufficient user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate Company personnel; (ii) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial information technology applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch and interface jobs are monitored, privileges are appropriately granted, and data backups are authorized and monitored. 
 None of the material weaknesses described above resulted in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. However, the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 After giving full consideration to these material weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures we performed to ensure that our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, our management has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 
 On April 19, 2024, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to Qoo10, whereby Qoo10 paid the Company 162 million in cash, after giving effect to certain purchase price adjustments, and agreed to assume substantially all of the Company s liabilities Asset Sale ). Subsequent to the Asset Sale, the Company s assets consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as federal income tax net operating loss ("NOLs") carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (for which the Company has provided a full valuation allowance). 
 The Company has been reassessing its remediation efforts since the closing of the Asset Sale, given that (i) most of the information technology ("IT") systems were sold to Qoo10 and (ii) the process controls associated with the material weakness in the control environment are no longer applicable to the relatively limited size, scope, and complexity of the Company s current control environment. As a result, our management is currently redesigning a completely new control environment with new IT systems, processes and controls commensurate with our currently limited ongoing business operations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 34 

Other than the remediation actions to address the existing material weaknesses as described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The information set forth under Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties set forth below, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect our business. These risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our financial condition and/or operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our financial conditions and/or operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, as well as the completion of the Asset Sale on April 19, 2024, our past financial results will not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be unduly used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Since the Asset Sale, we have had no material operations and no material sources of operating revenue, which may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. 
 Since the closing of the Asset Sale, we have not had an operating business generating revenues. Until we deploy the Post-Closing Cash and otherwise utilize our NOLs, we will have no material sources of operating revenue other than interest income on our marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. Although the strategic alternatives under evaluation by our Board of Directors for the use of the Post-Closing Cash include funding, at least in part, the acquisition of businesses or assets that will potentially allow us to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, there can be no guarantee that suitable assets will be available for us to purchase or that any assets acquired will generate the revenues anticipated or any revenue at all. If we are not able to acquire suitable assets, the value of our remaining tax attributes will be limited and may be worthless. A failure by us to secure additional sources of revenue could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. 
 If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our results of operations could be harmed. 
 Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), a company generally will be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. If we were obligated to register as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things, limitations on capital structure, restrictions on specified investments, prohibitions on transactions with affiliates, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would increase our operating and compliance costs, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated, and would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We continue to incur the expense of complying with public company reporting requirements following the closing of the Asset Sale. 
 Since the Asset Sale was consummated, we have continued, and will continue, to be required to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and such compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome and requires our management s time and attention. 
 As a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 In addition, as a public company, our management and other key personnel must divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company. In particular, we incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 As a result of our obligations as a public company, we may be subject to threatened or actual litigation, including by stockholders and competitors. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, 
 36 

and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Risks Related to our NOLs and Other Tax Attributes 
 We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had federal NOLs available to reduce future taxable income, if any, of 886 million that begin to expire in 2030 and continue to expire through 2037 and 1.9 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2023, we had state NOLs available to reduce future taxable income, if any, of 7.0 billion that begin to expire in 2026 and continue to expire through 2043 and 2.0 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Under legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), unused U.S. federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, will not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80 of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. Additionally, portions of these NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited. For example, California recently imposed limits on the usability of California state NOLs to offset taxable income in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2022. As a result, even if we acquire income producing assets and attain profitability in the future, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows and the value of our common stock. 
 An ownership change could limit the use of our NOLs and our potential to derive a benefit from our NOLs. 
 The utilization of NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and similar state statutes as a result of ownership changes that could occur in the future. While we believe that our NOLs are currently not subject to limitation under these rules and have entered into a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan designed to preserve and protect our NOLs, there is no guarantee that we have not undergone an ownership change in the past or that such plan will prevent us from experiencing an ownership change in the future which would limit our ability to use our NOLs. 
 In general, an ownership change would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than 50 by one or more 5 stockholders during a three-year test period. 
 Our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan does not prohibit a stockholder from acquiring a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and adversely impacting our ability to preserve our NOLs. 
 Our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is designed to preserve the value of certain tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards under Section 382 of the Code by deterring new 5 stockholders and is triggered by an unauthorized person acquiring or holding more than 4.9 of our outstanding voting securities. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is designed to deter new 5 stockholders through economic dilution, but does not prohibit a stockholder from acquiring more than 4.9 of our outstanding voting securities which could cause an ownership change if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than 50 by one or more 5 stockholders during a three-year test period which could materially and adversely reduce and restrict our ability to utilize and benefit from our NOLs. 
 Risks Related to our Business Plan and Future Operations 
 We may face difficulties or delays or be unsuccessful in a search to acquire an operating business or assets, and we may expend significant time and capital on a prospective business or asset acquisition that is not ultimately consummated. 
 Our Board of Directors is evaluating strategic alternatives, including the potential to use the Post-Closing Cash and to utilize our NOLs by acquiring assets or a business. The investigation of any specific target assets or a business and any subsequent negotiation and drafting of related agreements, SEC disclosure and other documents would require substantial amounts of management s time and attention and material additional costs in connection with outsourced services from accountants, attorneys and other professionals. We would likely expend significant time and resources searching for, conducting due diligence on, and negotiating transaction terms in connection with a proposed asset or a business acquisition that may not ultimately come to fruition. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable assets or business may arise that force us to terminate discussions with a target company, such as the target s failure or inability to provide adequate documentation to assist in our investigation, a party s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction as required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive bid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the transaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for new assets or a business and investors should be aware of them before investing in an enterprise such as ours and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to acquire assets or a revenue producing business. 
 We expect to face intense competition in our search for assets or a revenue-producing business to combine with or acquire. Other parties, such as private equity and venture capital firms, larger companies, and other strategic investors, may have greater capital or human resources than we do and/or more experience in a particular industry within which we 
 37 

choose to search. These competitors may have a certain amount of liquid cash available to take advantage of favorable market conditions for a prospective asset or business purchase. Any delay or inability to locate, negotiate and enter into an asset or business acquisition as a result of any disadvantages we have relative to those other potential purchasers could cause us to lose valuable business opportunities to those other potential purchasers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business plan and results of operations. Moreover, economic factors that are beyond our control, including inflation and higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, as well as geopolitical instability may hinder our ability to locate and obtain assets or a business on terms that are favorable to us. 
 In addition, we have limited capital, and we may not be able to take advantage of any available business opportunities on favorable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital or be able to raise additional capital to provide us with the necessary funds to successfully acquire assets or a business we deem to be appropriate or necessary to accomplish our objectives, in which case we may be forced to terminate our efforts to acquire assets or a revenue producing business and your investment in our common stock could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, any debt financing that we may secure in connection with an acquisition, could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit or restrict our ability to take certain actions. There is no guarantee that financing would be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 If we are not successful in acquiring assets or a new business and generating material revenues, investors may lose their entire investment. 
 If we are not successful in acquiring assets or a new business through which to implement it, our investors entire investment in our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Even if we are successful in acquiring the assets of an operating entity, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate material revenue therefrom in the short-term or at all or that investors will derive a profit from their investment. If we are not successful, our investors may lose their entire investment. 
 We may attempt to complete an acquisition with a private target company about which little information is available, and such target entity may not generate revenue as expected or otherwise be compatible with us as expected. 
 In pursuing our search for assets or a business to acquire, we may seek to complete a business acquisition with a privately-held company or acquire assets from a privately-held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and the only information available to us prior to making a decision may be from documents and information provided directly to us by the target company in connection with the transaction. Such documents or information or the conclusions we draw therefrom could prove to be inaccurate or misleading. As such, we may be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential asset or business acquisition based on limited, incomplete or faulty information, which may result in our subsequent operations generating less revenue than expected, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
 When evaluating the desirability of a potential business acquisition, our ability to assess the target business s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our management s assessment of the capabilities of the target s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Should the target s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with their former entity s merger or combination into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively impacted, and our stockholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. 
 Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining any future acquisitions and investments. 
 We may acquire assets, businesses or technologies in the future. Integrating an acquired asset, business or technology is difficult and can be risky. These potential and completed transactions create risks such as: 
 the risks associated with assuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before and after the acquisition, including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, cyberattacks, taxes, and other matters; and 

the difficulty of integrating new assets, businesses and technologies into our infrastructure. 

Acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash, issue stock, incur debt or other liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets, or incur write-offs of goodwill or other assets. Finally, acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts, investors or our users. 
 The success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. 
 The success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain members of our management. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly disrupt our business. Although we take prudent steps to retain key personnel, we face competition for qualified individuals from numerous professional services and other companies. For example, our competitors may be able to attract and retain more qualified professional and technical personnel by offering more competitive compensation packages. If we are unable to attract new personnel and retain our current personnel, we may not be able execute our business plan. 
 38 

Risks Related to the Asset Purchase Agreement 
 The Purchaser did not assume the excluded liabilities under the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer did not assume all of the liabilities associated with our prior business. Certain liabilities remained with us post-closing. For example, the Buyer did not assume any liabilities arising out of or related to the employment or termination of service of any employee of ours who did not transfer to the Buyer or arising from severance payments to, or unpaid wages owed to, any employee who declined the Buyer s offer of employment or service or certain third party claims related to the Company s initial public offering, including an existing class action lawsuit and a stockholder derivative action. Such liabilities, together with other excluded liabilities under the Asset Purchase Agreement, could be significant. We can provide no assurance that we will not incur material post-closing liabilities. 
 We have counterparty risk with the Buyer and its affiliates for certain ongoing obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement and the failure of the Buyer and its affiliates to perform their obligations could cause us to suffer losses. 
 In connection with the Asset Sale, under the Asset Purchase Agreement we agreed with Buyer to transfer and assign the lease for the facility located at One Sansome Street (the Lease to Buyer and for Buyer to assume all obligations under the Lease. The Company relinquished control of the leased facility after the Asset Sale. In order to obtain the landlord s consent to the transfer of the Lease and effect its assignment, we agreed to maintain a letter of credit for an additional 90 days following the April 19, 2024 closing date during which time (i) Buyer was obligated to secure a replacement security acceptable to the landlord and (ii) we and Buyer agreed to provide the landlord with cash collateral in the amount of 7 million funded equally by the parties. As of October 31, 2024, the landlord had consented to the assignment of the Lease to the Buyer. However, we maintain the letter of credit for the facility. Until the landlord accepts a replacement security proposed by the Buyer, any event by the landlord to draw on the security will come from the maintained letter of credit. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer agreed to assume all obligations under the Lease since the Asset Sale. 
 As of August 1, 2024, it has been reported that two of Parent Qoo10 s e-commerce platforms had filed for receivership in South Korea shortly after it was announced that Qoo10 was being investigated in South Korea for failures to make payments to vendors in South Korea. If the Buyer fails to pay the rent under the Lease or comply with other obligations under the Lease, we would be responsible for the remaining obligations under the Lease. While the cash collateral held as restricted cash on our balance sheet could be utilized to satisfy Lease obligations should Buyer fail to meet them, half of the cash collateral has been funded by the Company, and if more than half of the cash collateral is used to satisfy obligations under the Lease, such funds will not be returned to the Company. While the Buyer would be responsible for such obligations under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining payment or reimbursement from Buyer or Qoo10 for such losses. 
 Risks Related to Our Internal Controls 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. 
 During the preparation and the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, given our reliance on information technology IT systems to synthesize both financial and nonfinancial information, any material weaknesses in our IT controls may result in errors in not only our consolidated financial statements but our nonfinancial metrics as well. 
 The material weaknesses we identified in 2021 occurred because (i) the processes and controls over our IT systems relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements were inadequate and (ii) the current processes in place were insufficient to allow us to complete the testing and assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner. 
 As described in Item 4, "Controls and Procedures", we will continue our initiatives to implement measures designed to ensure that remaining control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. 
 We cannot guarantee that our efforts will remediate these deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. See Item 4, Controls and Procedures for further discussions of the identified material weaknesses. 
 Our management is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports. 
 39 

As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. 
 We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. While we have developed a new control environment with new systems, processes and controls commensurate with our ongoing business going forward, and new business processes and controls were designed and documented in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting through remediation measures described in Item 4, Controls and Procedures Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses , we cannot guarantee that these changes will remediate future deficiencies or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. 
 In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls. 
 Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, some of which may arise from our restructuring and turnaround initiatives. We and our independent registered public accounting firm identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and additional weaknesses may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and our independent registered public accounting firm s attestation reports required by the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could diminish investor confidence, negatively affect the price of our common stock, and could result in our delisting on Nasdaq. As noted previously, see Item 4, Controls and Procedures for further discussions of the identified material weaknesses. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 
 The uncertainty regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and our future operations may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. 
 We have broad discretion regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale. Although our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate various strategic alternatives regarding the use of the proceeds from the Asset Sale with a goal to maximize stockholder value, including through potentially using our cash and/or our NOLs, it has not yet identified any particular acquisitions or investments or committed to making any such decision by a particular date. This uncertainty may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. 
 There is no assurance that we will remain compliant with Nasdaq's listing requirements. 
 Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, in order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards including, without limitation, that our closing bid price be at least 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). 
 On April 10, 2023, following stockholder approval, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. On April 12, 2023, our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As of April 26, 2023, we regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 Since the completion of the Asset Sale, our common stock has continued to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. However, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules. If we were to fall out of compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, there can be no assurance that our common stock would be eligible to be listed on any other national securities exchange. 
 Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 We may issue additional common stock, subscription rights, convertible securities or other equity securities. We may also expect to issue common stock to our employees, directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans or otherwise. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. 
 40 

If we choose to pursue an asset or business acquisition, we may require additional capital to fund such acquisition. Depending on the acquisition we pursue, future business development activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses and accounting expenses may require a substantial amount of additional capital. We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. 
 The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market. 
 Our stockholders may not be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve an asset or business acquisition as we pursue strategic alternatives. 
 Our stockholders may not be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business acquisition. In most cases, asset or business acquisitions do not require stockholder approval under applicable law, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not afford our stockholders with the right to approve such a transaction. In order to develop and implement our business plan, we may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts, appraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining our direction and consummating any transactions contemplated thereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Company s future business and prospects. The selection of any such persons will be made by our Board of Directors, and any expenses incurred, or decisions made based on any of the foregoing could prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our stockholders. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, and any decision on our part to comply only with reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to such companies could make our ordinary shares less attractive to investors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we qualified as a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Exchange Act, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company, and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or our public float, is less than 250 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. This includes reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings such as simplified executive compensation disclosures, exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and only being required to provide two years of audited consolidated financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects and investors may find our shares of common stock less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and greater stock price volatility. 
 We do not expect to pay any cash dividends to the holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future and the availability and timing of future cash dividends, if any, is uncertain. 
 We do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors will determine the amount and timing of stockholder dividends, if any, that we may pay in future periods. In making this determination, our directors will consider all relevant factors, including the amount of cash available for dividends, capital expenditures, covenants, prohibitions or limitations with respect to dividends, applicable law, general operational requirements and other variables. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any future dividends you may receive, and if we do commence the payment of dividends, we may be unable to pay, maintain or increase dividends over time. Therefore, you may not be able to realize any return on your investment in our common stock for an extended period of time, if at all, other than by selling your shares. 
 The price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile. Declines in the price of our common stock has resulted in and could subject us to future litigation. 
 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and declined and may continue to fluctuate or decline substantially. Accordingly, the price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations for many reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including those described in this "Risk Factors" section and others such as: 
 failure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock; 

uncertainty among investors relating to the strategic alternative that we will choose, including any prospective asset or business acquisition and the terms and conditions thereof; 

the operating performance of any business we may acquire, if any, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom; 

the performance of our competitors in the marketplace; 

the public s reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information; 

41 

changes in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire, if any, or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies in the industry of a business that we acquire, if any; 

variations in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as future pandemics, global conflicts and interest rates; 

the public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future; 

the number of shares of our common stock that are eligible to be publicly traded in the future; 

litigation or claims against us; and 

any other factors discussed in this report. 

Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether we choose to pursue and consummate an asset or business acquisition and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, in our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock. 
 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management. Among other things, the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide: 
 our Board of Directors became classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; 

directors can be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our common stock. Vacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders; 

certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of our common stock; 

authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; 

our stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent; 

stockholders may not call special meetings of the stockholders; 

our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws; 

that the forum for certain litigation against us must be Delaware or the U.S. federal district courts; and 

advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 

In addition, in connection with the approval of the Asset Purchase Agreement, our Board of Directors adopted the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in order to protect against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use the Company s NOLs and certain other tax attributes to reduce potential future U.S. federal income tax obligations. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could result in the significant dilution of the holdings of a stockholder that acquires more than 4.9 of our common stock. Please refer to the section titled Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in Note 1 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The provisions described above may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company. 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
 42 

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or (v) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 
 This provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation further provides that the U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. 
 These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision of our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable to or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. 
 We have been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation matters or other legal proceedings that are expensive and time consuming. 
 We have been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation matters, including class action lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation, loss of rights, or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management. 
 Additionally, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. As a result, we have been named in lawsuits, and may be subject to both ongoing litigation and other requests related to our stock price/performance and/or performance and independence of our Board of Directors. 
 We are currently party to three putative class action lawsuits that were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company, its directors, certain of its officers and the underwriters named in its initial public offering IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws based on statements made in its registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC in connection with its IPO and seeking monetary damages and that have been coordinated and consolidated (the IPO Case ). In May 2022, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs, who subsequently filed an amended consolidated class action complaint pursuant to Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and in April 2023, the plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated class action complaint and asserted only claims made under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. The Court dismissed this complaint in December 2023 with leave to amend. In February 2024, the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint, which Defendants have moved to dismiss. In August 2024, the Court granted the motion to dismiss without leave to amend and with prejudice. In September 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion to alter judgment noticed for hearing in January 2025. 
 In addition, in August 2021, a shareholder derivative action purportedly brought on behalf of the Company, Patel v. Szulczewski, was filed in the U.S. federal court alleging that the Company s directors and officers made or caused the Company to make false and/or misleading statements about the Company s business operations and financial prospects in various public filings. This matter is stayed pending certain motion practice in the IPO Case. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of these cases at this time and we may continue to be the target of securities litigations, and/or may receive other civil and regulator inquiries and requests, in the future. Securities litigation or inquiries or investigations against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business, results of operation, and/or reputation.
