CRYO-CELL INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOL IDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 August 31, 2024 
 (Unaudited) 
 
 reportable segments: (1) cellular processing and cryogenic cellular storage, with a current focus on the collection and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells for family use (2) the manufacture of PrepaCyte CB units, the processing technology used to process umbilical cord blood stem cells and (3) cryogenic storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells for public use. Revenues for the cellular processing and cryogenic cellular storage represent sales of the umbilical cord blood stem cells program to customers and income from licensees selling the umbilical cord blood stem cells program to customers outside the United States. Revenues for the manufacture of PrepaCyte CB units represent sales of the PrepaCyte CB units to customers. Revenue for the cryogenic storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells for public use, stored at Duke University (see below), is generated from the sale of the cord blood units to the National Marrow Donor Program NMDP ), which distributes the cord blood units to transplant centers located in the United States and around the world. The Company s headquarters facility in Oldsmar, Florida handles all aspects of its U.S.-based business operations including the processing and storage of specimens, including specimens obtained from certain of its licensees customers. The specimens are stored in commercially available cryogenic storage equipment. The unaudited consolidated financial statements including the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, the related Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, Cash Flows for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 and Stockholders Deficit for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared by Cryo-Cell International, Inc. pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting. Certain financial information and note disclosures, which are normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's November 30, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and changes in cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any interim period in the future or the entire year ending November 30, 2024. 
 shares had been issued to the subsidiary. Celle Corp. was created to hold certain assets of Cryo-Cell not directly associated with the recurring revenue stream from privately banked, umbilical cord blood specimens. The Patent and Technology License Agreement with Duke University and Amendments have been transferred to Celle Corp. and other assets and liabilities may be transferred in the near future.

and . Deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the portion of the annual, the twenty-one-year and the life-time storage fees that are being recognized over the contractual storage period as well as royalties received from foreign licensees relating to long-term storage contracts for which the Company has future obligations under the license agreement. The Company classifies deferred revenue as current if the Company expects to recognize the related revenue over the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. Significant financing component When determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. For all plans being annual,

, which will be recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the contractual period of which , will be recognized over the next . Variable consideration In December 2005, the Company began providing its customers that enrolled after December 2005 a payment warranty under which the Company agrees to pay to its client if the umbilical cord blood product retrieved is used for a stem cell transplant for the donor or an immediate family member and fails to engraft, subject to various restrictions. Effective February 1, 2012, the Company increased the payment warranty to a payment warranty to all of its new clients. Effective June 1, 2017, the Company increased the payment warranty to to all new clients who choose the premium processing method, PrepaCyte CB. The product warranty is available to clients who enroll under this structure for as long as the specimen is stored with the Company. In the processing and storage agreements, the Company provides limited rights which are offered to customers automatically upon contract execution. The Company has determined that the payment warranty represents variable consideration payable to the customer. Based on the Company s historical experience to date, the Company has determined the payment warranty to be fully constrained under the most likely amount method. Consequently, the transaction price does not currently reflect any expectation of service level credits. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will update the estimated transaction price related to the payment warranty including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period. Allocation of transaction price As the Company s processing and storage agreements contain multiple performance obligations, ASC 606 requires an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation. The Company has selected an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the processing services and storage services and concluded that the published list price is the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay for those goods or services. The Company also considered the fact that all customers are charged the list prices current at the time of their enrollment where the Company has separately stated list prices for processing and storage. Costs to Obtain a Contract The Company capitalizes commissions that are incremental in obtaining customer contracts and the costs incurred to fulfill a customer contract if those costs are not within the scope of another topic within the accounting literature and meet the specified criteria. These costs are deferred in other current or long-term assets and are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as the Company satisfies the performance obligations by transferring the service to the customer. These assets will be periodically assessed for impairment. As a practical expedient, the Company elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining its annual contracts as an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the asset recognized would have been . The Company has determined that payments under the Company s refer-a-friend program RAF program are incremental costs of obtaining a contract as they provide an incentive for existing customers to refer new customers to the Company and is referred to as commission. The amount paid under the RAF program (either through issuance of credits to customers or check payments) which exceeds the typical commission payment to a sales representative is recorded as a reduction to revenue under ASC 606. During the three

and , respectively, in commission payments to customers under the RAF program as a reduction to revenue. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023 , the Company recorded and , respectively, in commission payments to customers under the RAF program as a reduction to revenue. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 the Company capitalized additional contract acquisition costs of and , respectively, net of amortization. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023 , the Company capitalized additional contract acquisition costs of and , respectively, net of amortization expense. b) Public banking revenue 

 The Company sells and provides units not likely to be of therapeutic use for research to qualified organizations and companies operating under Institutional Review Board approval. Control is transferred at the point in time when the shipment has occurred, at which time, the Company records revenue. c) Licensee and royalty income 

 Licensee and royalty income consist of royalty income earned on the processing and storage of cord blood stem cell specimens by an affiliate where the Company has a License and Royalty Agreement. The Company records revenue from processing and storage of specimens and pursuant to agreements with licensees. The Company records the royalty revenue in same period that the related processing and storage is being completed by the affiliate. d) Product Revenue 

 The Company records revenue from the sale of the PrepaCyte CB product line upon shipment of the product to the Company s customers. e) Shipping and handling 

 The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to account for shipping and handling activities performed after the control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. Shipping and handling costs that the Company incurs are therefore expensed and included in cost of sales. Disaggregation of Revenue The revenue as reflected in the statements of income is disaggregated by products and services. 

Accounts receivable 

Short-term contract liabilities (deferred revenue) 

Long-term contract liabilities (deferred revenue) 

The Company, in general, requires the customer to pay for processing and storage services at the time of processing. Contract assets include deferred contract acquisition costs, which will be amortized along with the associated revenue. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. Accounts receivable consists of amounts due from clients that have enrolled and processed in the umbilical cord blood stem cell processing and storage programs related to renewals of annual plans and amounts due from license affiliates, and sublicensee territories. The Company did t have asset impairment charges related to contract assets in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024. The following table presents changes in the Company s contract assets and liabilities during the nine months ended August 31, 2024:

and are stated at amounts net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company s previous loss history, and the client s current ability to pay its obligations. Therefore, if the financial condition of the Company s clients were to deteriorate beyond the estimates, the Company may have to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a negative impact on earnings. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. for Duke to receive, process, and store cord blood units for the Public Cord Blood Bank Duke Services ). As of August 31, 2024 , the Company had approximately cord blood units in inventory. These units are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs include the cost of collecting, transporting, processing and storing the unit. Costs charged by Duke for their Duke Services are based on a monthly fixed fee for processing and storing blood units per year. The Company computes the cost per unit for these Duke Services and capitalizes the unit cost on all blood units shipped and stored in a year at Duke. If the Company ships and stores less than blood units with Duke in a one-year period, a portion of these fixed costs are expensed and included in facility operating costs. Certain costs of collection incurred, such as the cost of collection staff and transportation costs incurred to ship Public Bank units from hospitals to the stem cell laboratory are allocated to banked units based on an average cost method. The change in the number of expected units to be sold could have a significant impact on the estimated net realizable value of banked units which could have a material effect on the value of the inventory. Costs incurred related to cord blood units that cannot be sold are expensed in the period incurred and are included in facility operating costs in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company records a reserve against inventory for units which have been processed and frozen but may not ultimately become distributable (see Note 3).

The Company recognized and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively, of stock option compensation expense. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the related awards. Under the fair value recognition guidance of stock-based compensation accounting rules, stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of service-based vesting condition and performance-based vesting condition stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For stock option awards with only service-based vesting conditions and graded vesting features, the Company recognizes stock compensation expense based on the graded-vesting method. To value awards with market-based vesting conditions the Company uses

The following is a description of the valuation techniques used for these items, as well as the general classification of such items pursuant to the fair value hierarchy: Marketable securities - Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized through net income. There was and in unrealized holding gain, respectively, recorded in other income and expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. There was and in unrealized holding gain, respectively, recorded in other income and expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. Interest rate swap - The fair value is based on prevailing market data and derived from proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions. As of the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 there was a and gain on a derivative recorded on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, there was a and gain on a derivative recorded on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. On April 15, 2024, the Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement and recorded proceeds of . Contingent consideration - The contingent consideration is the earnout that Cord:Use is entitled to from the Company s sale of the Public Cord Blood Inventory from and after closing. The estimated fair value of the contingent earnout was determined using a Monte Carlo analysis examining the frequency and mean value of the resulting earnout payments. The resulting value captures the risk associated with the form of the payout structure. The risk-neutral method is applied, resulting in a value that captures the risk associated with the form of the payout structure and the projection risk. The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly and actual amounts paid may be materially different from the estimated value of the liability. 
 to its client if the umbilical cord blood product retrieved is used for a stem cell transplant for the donor or an immediate family member and fails to engraft, subject to various restrictions. Effective February 1, 2012, the Company increased the payment warranty to a payment warranty to all of its new clients. Effective June 1, 2017, the Company increased the payment warranty to to all new clients who choose the premium processing method, PrepaCyte CB. The product warranty is available to clients who enroll under this structure for as long as the specimen is stored with the Company. The Company has not experienced any claims under the warranty program nor has it incurred costs related to these warranties. As discussed above, the Company has determined that the payment warranty represents variable consideration payable to the customer. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company has concluded the payment warranty be fully constrained under the most likely amount method; therefore, the transaction price does not reflect any expectation of service level credits at August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 . At the end of each reporting period, the Company shall update the estimated transaction price related to the payment guarantee including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock over the most recent period commensurate with the expected life of the Company s stock options. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted to employees is based upon historical exercise data. Expected dividends are based on the historical trend of the Company not issuing dividends other than the one-time, special cash dividend declared by the Board of Directors on August 19, 2022.

and contain certain provisions for severance payments in the event of certain events, including termination or change of control. Legal Proceedings On January 6, 2023, a complaint styled Lindsey Lehr v. Cryo-Cell International, Inc., Case No. 50-2023-CA-000091, was filed in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida, naming the Company as defendant and asserting claims on behalf of a putative class of individuals who entered agreements with the Company for umbilical cord blood storage services since May 2018. The complaint alleges that the Company s advertising does not accurately represent the value and efficacy of its services and asserts claims (and seeks unspecified damages) under Florida law. On March 14, 2023, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case No. 9:23-cv-80405-AMC), and on March 21, 2023, moved to compel arbitration and stay the case. On October 10, 2023, the Court granted the Company s motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case. The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. The Company believes the plaintiff s claims are without merit and intends to contest the action vigorously. The Company believes that the resolution of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of the claims asserted, which could negatively and materially impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail. The Company does not include an estimate of legal fees and other related defense costs in its estimate of loss contingencies. On October 4, 2024, the Company filed a demand for arbitration (the Arbitration Demand against Duke with the American Arbitration Association AAA ), alleging that Duke fraudulently induced Cryo-Cell to enter the Duke License Agreement and breached the agreement on various occasions. The Arbitration Demand includes five counts against Duke, as follows: Count I Breach of the Duke License Agreement; Count II Breach of Implied Contractual Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; Count III Fraudulent Inducement to Enter the Duke License Agreement; Count IV Violation of North Carolina s Unfair Trade Practices Act; and Count V Unjust Enrichment. In connection therewith, the Company has requested that the arbitrator enter an award in the Company s favor and against Duke for damages in an amount to be proved at a final hearing, interest, attorneys fees, and arbitration fees and costs, along with all other relief to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity. As of October 15, 2024, Duke has not responded to the Arbitration Demand. See Note 12 and Risk Factors for additional information regarding Duke. In addition to the above lawsuit, from time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, contract disputes and other claims in the normal course of its business. shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.

The Company has made the required payments due to Duke to date under the Duke License Agreement, and it will pay in Q4 2024 a final payment of under the Clinical Study and Research Agreement that the Company entered into with Duke dated March 3, 2023 in connection with the Second Amendment to the Duke License Agreement. As previously disclosed, the Duke License Agreement also imposes certain future royalty payment obligations along with an obligation to pay certain legal fees and expenses associated with related patents. The Company is also obligated to pay Duke two years after the first patient or subject is treated in the first Phase III clinical trial of a licensed product comprising mesenchymal stromal cells for an indication other than Autism Spectrum Disorder, of which there can be no assurances. In fiscal 2021, the Company capitalized in connection with the Duke License Agreement, which was considered to be an asset acquisition and which represented the costs to obtain the Duke License Agreement, and also recorded a corresponding liability to Duke for the Duke License Agreement. The Company was amortizing these costs over . However, during fiscal 2023, the Company recognized that there were indications of impairment of the assets associated with the Duke License Agreement. The Company evaluated the triggering events that existed as of November 30, 2023, tested the asset group for recoverability and measured the long-lived asset impairment. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of the full carrying value of . As of the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company recorded and , respectively, in amortization expense which is reflected in amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company recorded and , respectively, in amortization expense which is reflected in amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As stated above, through the Duke License Agreement, the Company had intended to expand to a triad of core business units to include: (1) its cord blood bank and other storage services; (2) cord blood and cord tissue infusion clinic services initally under the FDA's Expanded Access Program and in conjunction with the undertaking of cord blood and cord tissue clinical trials to obtain BLA approvals for new indications, and (3) biopharmaceutical manufacturing if BLA(s) were approved by the FDA. As of the date hereof, the Company can make no assurances it will be able to expand its business into business units (2) and (3) above. Until the Duke arbitration claims are resolved, the Company does not anticipate making further investments (other than the completion of a comparability study estimated to cost less than in additional capital) in activities related to the Duke License Agreement. The Company s previously disclosed agreement with a clinical research organization, The Emmes Company, LLC, will require an immaterial final payment if the Company terminates such agreement.

 Overview 
 The Company currently stores over 235,000 cord blood and cord tissue specimens for the exclusive benefit of newborn babies and possibly other members of their families. Founded in 1989, the Company was the world s first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992. The Company s U.S.-based business operations, including the processing and storage of specimens, are handled from its headquarters facility in Oldsmar, Florida. 
 Utilizing its infrastructure, experience and resources derived from its umbilical cord blood stem cell business, the Company has expanded its research and development activities to develop technologies related to stem cells harvested from sources beyond umbilical cord blood stem cells. In 2011, the Company introduced its new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. The Company offers the cord tissue service in combination with the umbilical cord blood service. 
 28 

As discussed further in Note 12, effective as of February 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement (the Duke License Agreement with Duke University Duke ). The Duke License Agreement grants the Company certain rights to proprietary processes and regulatory data related to cord blood and cord tissue developed at Duke. Through the Duke License Agreement, the Company had anticipated, either directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Celle Corp., exploring, testing, and administering treatments to patients with osteoarthritis and with conditions for which there are limited U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved therapies, including cerebral palsy, autism, and multiple sclerosis. These treatments were expected to utilize the unique immunomodulatory and potential regenerative properties derived from cord blood and cord tissue. Through the Duke License Agreement, the Company, together with Celle Corp., hoped to develop three business units, namely: (1) its cord blood bank and other storage services (its historical business); (2) cord blood and cord tissue infusion clinic services initially under the FDA's Expanded Access Program in conjunction with the undertaking of cord blood and cord tissue clinical trials to obtain biologics license application BLA approvals for new indications, and (3) biopharmaceutical manufacturing if BLA(s) were approved by the FDA. Additionally, to support such business expansion, the Company had anticipated opening and launching its Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies, which it initially hoped to open as early as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, but no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2022, but more recently reported that it anticipated opening it during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the date hereof, the Company can make no assurances it will be able to expand its business into business units (2) and (3) above. 
 Until the Duke arbitration claims are resolved, the Company does not anticipate making further investments (other than the completion of a comparability study estimated to cost less than 350,000 in additional capital) in activities related to the Duke License Agreement. The opening of the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies is also on pause and the Company can make no assurances as to when it will be opened. Additionally, the proposed spinoff of Celle Corp. is also on hold and may not occur depending on the outcome of the Duke dispute. See, Risk Factors . 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company recognized that there were indications of impairment of the assets associated with the Duke License Agreement. The Company evaluated the triggering events that existed as of November 30, 2023, tested the asset group for recoverability and measured the long-lived asset impairment. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of the full carrying value of 13,108,064. 
 
 Cord Blood Stem Cell Processing and Storage Business 
 
 Background of Business 
 Nearly fifty years ago researchers discovered that cells could be cryopreserved at extremely low temperatures and all cellular activity would cease until the specimens were thawed. Historically, cryopreservation was required for organ transplants, blood banking and medical research. Today, cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells gives individuals the opportunity to potentially take advantage of evolving cellular therapies and other medical technologies. 
 Hematopoietic stem cells are the building blocks of our blood and immune systems. They form the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body and platelets that promote healing. These cells are found in bone marrow where they continue to generate cells throughout our lives. Stem cells can be stored in a cryogenic environment, and upon thawing, infused into a patient. They can be returned to the individual from whom they were taken (autologous) or donated to someone else (allogeneic). An individual s own bone marrow may be used for a transplant if the cancer has not entered the marrow system (metastasized). Otherwise, a marrow donor needs to be identified to provide the needed bone marrow. The availability of a marrow donor or matched stem cell specimen allows physicians to administer larger doses of chemotherapy or radiation in an effort to eradicate the disease. Stem cell therapies and transplants are used for both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. 
 Stem cells are found in umbilical cord blood cord blood stem cells and can be collected and stored after a baby is born. Over 50,000 cord blood stem cell transplants have been performed to date. The Company believes that many parents will want to save and store these cells for potential future use by their family, either for the donor or for another family member. Today, stem cell transplants are known and accepted treatments for at least 78 diseases, we believe, a number of them life-threatening. With continued research in this area of medical technology, other therapeutic uses for cord blood stem cells are being explored. Moreover, researchers believe they may be utilized in the future for treating diseases that currently have no cure. 
 It is the Company s mission to inform expectant parents and their prenatal care providers of the potential medical benefits from preserving stem cells and to provide them the means and processes for collection and storage of these cells. A vast majority of expectant parents are simply unaware that umbilical cord blood contains a rich supply of non-controversial stem cells and that they can be collected, processed and stored for the potential future use of the newborn and possibly related family members. A baby s stem cells are a perfect match for the baby throughout its life and have a 1-in-4 chance of being a perfect match and a 3-in-4 chance of being an acceptable match for a sibling. There is no assurance, however, that a perfect match means the cells could be used to treat certain diseases of the newborn or a relative. Today, it is still common for the cord blood (the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta) to be 
 29 

discarded at the time of birth as medical waste. 
 Despite the potential benefits of umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation, the number of parents of newborns participating in stem cell preservation is still relatively small compared to the number of births (four million per annum) in the United States. Some reasons for this low level of market penetration are the misperception of the high cost of stem cell storage and a general lack of awareness of the benefits of stem cell preservation programs. However, evolving medical technology could significantly increase the utilization of the umbilical cord blood for transplantation and/or other types of treatments. The Company believes it offers the highest quality, highest value service targeted to a broad base of the market. We intend to maximize our growth potential through our superior quality, value-driven competitive leadership position, product differentiation, an embedded client base, increased public awareness and accelerated market penetration. 
 The Company believes that the market for cord blood stem cell preservation is enhanced by global discussion on stem cell research developments and the current focus on reducing prohibitive health care costs. With the increasing costs of bone marrow matches and transplants, a newborn s umbilical cord blood cells can be stored as a precautionary measure. Medical technology is constantly evolving which may provide new uses for cryopreserved cord blood stem cells. 
 
 Our Cord Blood Stem Cell Storage Services 
 The Company enters into storage agreements with its clients under which the Company charges a fee for the processing and testing and first year of storage of the umbilical cord blood. Thereafter, the client is charged an annual fee to store the specimen, unless the client entered into an 18-year pre-paid storage plan or a lifetime pre-paid storage plan. 
 The Company s corporate headquarters are located in a nearly 18,000 square-foot state-of-the-art current Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Tissue Practice (cGMP/cGTP)-compliant facility. Food and Drug Administration FDA 21 CFR Part 1271, effective in May 2005, requires human cellular and tissue-based products to be manufactured in compliance with good tissue practices (cGTPs). In addition, the cellular products cryogenic storage area has been designed as a bunker, with enhanced provisions for security, building fortification for environmental element protection and back-up systems for operational redundancies. The Company believes that it was the first private bank to process cord blood in a technologically and operationally advanced cGMP/cGTP-compliant facility. The Company s facility, which also currently houses the Company s client services, marketing and administrative operations, is designed to accommodate a broad range of events such as client tours and open houses, as well as educational workshops for clinicians and expectant parents. 

Competitive Advantages 
 The Company believes that it provides several key advantages over its competitors, including: 

The world s first private cord blood bank, that in combination with its global affiliates, currently stores over 235,000 cord blood and cord tissue specimens, 

Our facility s status as a cGMP- and cGTP-compliant private cord blood bank with AABB accreditation and FACT (the Foundation for the Accreditation for Cellular Therapy) accreditation, 

a state-of-the-art laboratory processing facility, 

utilization of a processing method using superior technology that yields the maximum recovery of healthy stem cells and provides superior red blood depletion over all other methods, 

a five-compartment cord blood freezer bag that allows for multiple uses of the baby s cord blood stem cells, 

a safe, secure and monitored storage environment, 

since inception, 100 viability rate of the Company s specimens upon thaw for therapeutic use, 

a state-of the-art, insulated collection kits, 

7-day per week processing capability, and 

a payment warranty under which the Company agrees to pay 50,000 (effective February 1, 2012 this payment was increased to 75,000 for new clients, effective June 1, 2017 this payment was increased to 100,000 for new clients that choose our premium cord blood processing method, PrepaCyte CB Processing System PrepaCyte CB )) to its client if the umbilical cord blood product retrieved is used for a stem cell transplant for the donor or an immediate family member and fails to engraft, subject to various restrictions.

Cord Tissue 
 In August 2011, the Company introduced its advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. Approximately six inches of the cord tissue is procured and transported to the Company s laboratory for processing, testing and cryopreservation for future potential use. Umbilical cord tissue is a rich source of MSCs, which have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage. MSCs are increasingly being researched in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions. 
 
 Public Banking 
 In June 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets (the Cord Purchase of Cord:Use Cord Blood Bank, Inc., a Florida corporation Cord:Use ), in accordance with the definitive Asset Purchase Agreement between Cryo-Cell and Cord:Use (the Purchase Agreement ), including without limitation Cord:Use s inventory of public cord blood units existing as of the closing date (the Public Cord Blood Inventory ). The Public Cord Blood Inventory creates a large, ethnically diverse, high quality inventory of available cord blood stem cell units for those in need of life saving therapy. The Company collects cord blood units at hospitals in Florida, Arizona, and California. The Company s public inventory is stored in North Carolina, and the cord blood units are sold through the National Marrow Donor Program NMDP located in Minnesota, who ultimately distributes the cord blood units to transplant centers located in the United States, and around the world. 
 
 ExtraVault 
 On July 18, 2022, the Company completed the purchase of a 56,000 square foot facility located near the Research Triangle Park in the Regional Commerce Center in Durham, North Carolina (the New Facility ). The New Facility has space for not only its existing and future internal storage needs, but also has the capacity to offer third party pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions cold storage services ExtraVault see www.extravault.com) , to set up a cellular therapy laboratory to manufacture mesenchymal stromal cells from cord tissue MSCs and the space to consolidate the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies under the same roof. 
 The Company anticipates this New Facility will expand the Company s cryopreservation and cold storage business by introducing a new service, ExtraVault www.extravault.com ). With over 30 years of experience in handling biological specimens for both research and clinical use, Cryo-Cell intends to leverage this expertise and offer these biorepository services to biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare institutions. The new facility is being constructed to offer state-of-the-art biologic, reagent and vaccine storage at cost effective prices. A robust inventory management system is planned to be implemented that Cryo-Cell believes will allow customers to view their own inventory through a customer portal and place distribution orders online. As a result, it is anticipated ExtraVault will provide expertise, experience, customer electronic access and cost sensitive solutions to the Company s partners in the biopharma and healthcare industries. 
 On May 15, 2024, the Company received the Certificate of Occupancy for the facility in Durham, North Carolina. 
 
 Marketing 
 The Company markets its cord blood stem cell preservation services directly to expectant parents and by distributing information through obstetricians, pediatricians, childbirth educators, certified nurse-midwives and other related healthcare professionals. The Company believes that its revenues have been facilitated by a variety of referral sources, resulting from high levels of customer satisfaction. New expectant parent referrals during fiscal 2022 are provided by physicians, midwives and childbirth educators, and by client-to-client referrals and repeat clients storing the stem cells of their additional children. 
 The Company has a national team of field cord blood educators who increase awareness of the benefits of storing cord blood and cord tissue to the Company s clinical referral sources, including physicians, midwives and hospitals and to expectant parents. Other promotional activities include internet advertisements and telemarketing activities. In addition, the Company exhibits at conferences, trade shows and other meetings attended by pregnant women and/or medical professionals. Significant portions of client referrals to the Company are from medical caregiver professionals. 
 The Company s client support team advisors are available by telephone to enroll clients and educate both expectant parents and the medical community on the life-saving potential of cord blood stem cell preservation. 
 The Company continues to use its website, www.cryo-cell.com, to market its services and to provide resource information to expectant parents. The site, which is frequently updated and improved, is divided into areas of interest, including sections for expectant parents, medical caregivers and investors. Expectant parents may request and receive information about the umbilical cord blood and cord tissue service and enroll online. 
 31 

The Company intends to continue offering cord blood and cord tissue banking services to expectant parents and relying on both online advertising and its national team of field cord blood educators to enroll new clients. A significant portion of its new enrollments are generated from returning customers and referrals. Many of the Company s clients choose to enter into either multiyear storage contracts, which results in deferred revenues that are recognized over the life the storage contracts. 
 Our public units are listed on the NMDP registry, which is connected to all other major international registries. NMDP has a contract with the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Human Health Services Department of the US government, to be the single point of access for bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood for transplant centers needing stem cells for transplant. 
 Additionally, the Company has definitive license agreements to market the Company s umbilical cord blood stem cell programs in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On July 18, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement Susser Agreement with Susser Bank, a Texas state bank, as administrative agent Susser on behalf of itself and the other lenders (collectively, the Lenders ), which was amended pursuant to an Amendment to Credit Agreement dated July 29, 2022, for (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 10,000,000 (the RCF and (ii) a term loan facility in an original principal amount of 8,960,000 (the Term Loan Susser and together with the RCF collectively, the Loans ). In connection with the RCF the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Note, in favor of Susser, in the stated principal amount of 10,000,000 (the RCF Note ), and in connection with the Term Loan the Company entered into a Term Note, in favor of Susser, in the stated principal amount of 8,960,000 (the Term Note and together with RCF Note, collectively, the Notes ). See Note 5. 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt obligation under the Term Note. On March 27, 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Susser to manage exposure to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt obligation under the Term Note. The swap agreement had a notional amount equal to the Term Loan. The agreement is to pay the Company monthly SOFR plus 3.25 on the notional amount and the Company is to pay a fixed rate of interest equal to 6.96 . The effective date of the amended term loan was March 27, 2023 with a maturity date of July 29, 2032.

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 301,297 which was primarily attributable to the payments of 2,306,428 to partially repay the Susser Bank note payable and revolving line of credit described above and 1,423,871 used to repurchase the Company's common stock which were partially offset by the proceeds received from the line of credit with Susser Bank described above in the amount of 3,200,000. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2023 was 532,226 which was primarily attributable to the payments of 615,690 to partially repay the TCB and Susser Bank note payable described above and 799,036 used to repurchase the Company's common stock which was partially offset by the proceeds received from the line of credit with Susser Bank described above in the amount of 950,000. 

The Company has a revolving line of credit, described above. The balance as of August 31, 2024 was 2,222,728 and is reflected on the accompanying balance sheet. 
 As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a Patent and Technology License Agreement dated effective as of February 23, 2021 (as amended, the "Duke License Agreement") with Duke University Duke ). Through the Duke License Agreement, the Company had anticipated, either directly or through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Celle Corp., exploring, testing, and administering treatments to patients with osteoarthritis and with conditions for which there are limited U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved therapies, including cerebral palsy, autism, and multiple sclerosis. In connection therewith, the Company had anticipated requiring capital to pay for the startup expenses relating to its planned infusion clinic, to finance clinical trials related to the Duke License Agreement, to develop biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and for capital expenditures for software enhancements and purchases of equipment and obligations under the Duke License Agreement. Specifically, the Company had previously anticipated that over 50 million would be needed over the next 5 years to fund its activities related to the Duke License Agreement. 
 However, on October 4, 2024, the Company filed a demand for arbitration (the Arbitration Demand against Duke with the American Arbitration Association AAA ). Among other things, the Company alleges in the Arbitration Demand that Duke fraudulently induced Cryo-Cell to enter the Duke License Agreement and further breached the agreement on various occasions. In connection therewith, the Company has requested that the arbitrator enter an award in the Company s favor and against Duke for damages in an amount to be proved at a final hearing, interest, attorneys fees, and arbitration fees and costs, along with all other relief to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity. Cryo-Cell has notified Duke that it believes such damages exceed 100 million. 
 As result of the Company s Arbitration Demand against Duke, the Company currently is unable to predict its funding needs for activities related to the Duke License Agreement. Until the Duke arbitration claims are resolved, the Company does not anticipate making further investments (other than the completion of a comparability study estimated to cost less than 350,000 in additional capital) in activities related to the Duke License Agreement. The opening of the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies is also on pause and the Company can make no assurances as to when it will be opened. Additionally, the proposed spinoff of Celle Corp. is also on hold and may not take place depending on the final outcome of the Duke dispute. 
 The Company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash flows from operation, together with external sources of capital will be sufficient to fund its known cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations will depend primarily upon increasing revenues from sales of its umbilical cord blood and cord tissue cellular storage services and managing discretionary expenses. Additionally, depending in part on the outcome of the Duke Arbitration Demand, the Company may require capital to pay for the startup expenses relating to its planned infusion clinic, to finance clinical trials related to 
 35 

the Duke License Agreement, to develop biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and for capital expenditures for software enhancements and purchases of equipment and obligations under the Duke License Agreement. While we previously anticipated that over 50 million would be needed over the next 5 years to fund its activities related to the Duke License Agreement, as result of the Company s Arbitration Demand against Duke, as discussed further in Note 12, the Company currently is unable to predict its funding needs for those activities. Until the Duke arbitration claims are resolved, the Company does not anticipate making further investments (other than the completion of a comparability study estimated to cost less than 350,000 in additional capital) in activities related to the Duke License Agreement. However, if required to continue to invest in the Duke License Agreement, the Company anticipates funding the related capital expenditures with cash-on-hand, cash flows from future operations, the Company s revolving line of credit (see Note 5), potential additional debt financing and potential equity sales. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain such additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. If expected increases in revenues are not realized, or if expenses are higher than anticipated, or if the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, the Company will be required to reduce or defer cash expenditures or otherwise manage its cash resources during the next 12 months so that they are sufficient to meet the Company s cash needs for that period. Any reductions in expenditures, if necessary, may have an adverse effect on the Company s business operations, including sales activities and the development of new services and technology.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For a full discussion of our accounting policies please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include: recognition of revenue and the related allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, income taxes and license and revenue sharing agreements. We continually evaluate our judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on the terms of underlying agreements, historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable based on the circumstances, the results of which form our management s basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonable likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on their most recent review, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s principal executive officers and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were fully effective, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to ensure that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 36 

There were no other changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Co-CEOs and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the control. 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 CEO and CFO Certifications 
 Appearing as exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 31.3 to this report there are Certifications of the Co-CEOs and the CFO. The Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications). This Item of this report is the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On January 6, 2023, a complaint styled Lindsey Lehr v. Cryo-Cell International, Inc., Case No. 50-2023-CA-000091, was filed in the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Florida, naming the Company as defendant and asserting claims on behalf of a putative class of individuals who entered agreements with the Company for umbilical cord blood storage services since May 2018. The complaint alleges that the Company s advertising does not accurately represent the value and efficacy of its services and asserts claims (and seeks unspecified damages) under Florida law. On March 14, 2023, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case No. 9:23-cv-80405-AMC), and on March 21, 2023, moved to compel arbitration and stay the case. On October 10, 2023, the Court granted the Company s motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case. The Company has not yet responded to the complaint. The Company believes the plaintiff s claims are without merit and intends to contest the action vigorously. The Company believes that the resolution of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of the claims asserted, which could negatively and materially impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail. The Company does not include an estimate of legal fees and other related defense costs in its estimate of loss contingencies. 
 On October 4, 2024, the Company filed a demand for arbitration (the Arbitration Demand against Duke with the American Arbitration Association AAA ), alleging that Duke fraudulently induced Cryo-Cell to enter the Duke License Agreement and breached the agreement on various occasions. The Arbitration Demand includes five counts against Duke, as follows: Count I Breach of the Duke License Agreement; Count II Breach of Implied Contractual Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; Count III Fraudulent Inducement to Enter the Duke License Agreement; Count IV Violation of North Carolina s Unfair Trade Practices Act; and Count V Unjust Enrichment. In connection therewith, the Company has requested that the arbitrator enter an award in the Company s favor and against Duke for damages in an amount to be proved at a final hearing, interest, attorneys fees, and arbitration fees and costs, along with all other relief to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity. As of October 15, 2024, Duke has not responded to the Arbitration Demand. See Note 12 and Risk Factors for additional information regarding Duke. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in our securities. These risk factors are effective as of the date of this Form 10-Q and shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that a statement contained in our future filings modifies or replaces such statement. All of these risks may impair our business operations. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the results we discuss in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Risk related to our business. 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. A number of these risks are listed below. These risks could affect actual future results and could cause them to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we have made. You should carefully consider the risks described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Any of the risks described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 There is uncertainty with regard to whether we will be able to maximize shareholder value through the completion of a strategic transaction or successfully spinoff Celle Corp. 
 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company formed its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, Celle Corp. Celle Corp. was created to hold certain assets of Cryo-Cell not directly associated with the recurring revenue stream from privately banked, umbilical cord blood specimens. The Duke Agreement has been transferred to Celle Corp. and other assets and liabilities are expected to be transferred in the near future. As previously disclosed, the Company s Board of Directors has authorized the spin-off of Celle Corp. to the Company s shareholders and to explore all strategic alternatives for the Company (post spin-off) to maximize shareholder value. There can be no assurance that any such transaction or spinoff will take place. There are several conditions that must first be satisfied, including obtaining certain third party consents, such as that of the Company s lender. If the Company is unable to spinoff Cell Corp., it will continue to own Cell Corp. and will continue to be obligated under the Duke Agreement and related agreements, such as the Duke Research Agreement and the Master Services Agreement with Emmes Biopharma Services LLC, all of which impose significant funding obligations, which could negatively impact the Company s financial condition. 
 
 Our common stock may be delisted from NYSE American LLC ("NYSE") if we fail to comply with continued listing standards. 
 38 

If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, including compliance with the NYSE's corporate governance requirements. 
 If we fail to comply with the NYSE's continued listing standards, we may be delisted from the NYSE. Delisting of the common stock could depress the price of our stock, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. 
 
 We may need to raise additional capital. 
 The Company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash flows from operations, together with external sources of capital will be sufficient to fund its known cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations will depend primarily upon revenues from sales of its umbilical cord blood and cord tissue cellular storage services and managing discretionary expenses. Additionally, depending in part on the outcome of the Duke Arbitration Demand, the Company may require capital to pay for the startup expenses relating to its planned infusion clinic, to finance clinical trials related to the Duke License Agreement, to develop biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and for capital expenditures for software enhancements and purchases of equipment and obligations under the Duke License Agreement. While the Company previously anticipated that over 50 million would be needed over the next 5 years to fund its activities related to the Duke License Agreement, as result of the Company s Arbitration Demand against Duke, as discussed further in Note 12, the Company currently is unable to predict its funding needs for those activities. Until the Duke arbitration claims are resolved, the Company does not anticipate making further investments (other than the completion of a comparability study estimated to cost less than 350,000 in additional capital) in activities related to the Duke License Agreement. However, if required to continue to invest in the Duke License Agreement, the Company anticipates funding the related capital expenditures with cash-on-hand, cash flows from future operations, the Company s revolving line of credit (see Note 5), potential additional debt financing and potential equity sales. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain such additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. If expected increases in revenues are not realized, or if expenses are higher than anticipated, or if the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, the Company will be required to reduce or defer cash expenditures or otherwise manage its cash resources during the next 12 months so that they are sufficient to meet the Company s cash needs for that period. Any reductions in expenditures, if necessary, may have an adverse effect on the Company s business operations, including sales activities and the development of new services and technology. 
 
 We may not be able to successfully grow or operate our business. 
 Our business may decline, may not grow or may grow more slowly than expected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or effectively operate our business. To the extent we are unable to achieve growth in our business we may continue to incur losses. We cannot assure you that we will be successful or make progress in the growth and operation of our business. Our success will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryopreservation of stem cells. Our current and future expense levels are based on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues and are subject to increase as we implement our strategy. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues would likely have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, if we should substantially increase our operating expenses to increase sales and marketing or to develop our technology and cord blood processing and storage systems, and such expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues, our operating performance and results would be adversely affected and if sustained could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The Company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectability risk on the Company s receivables, limitations on the Company s ability to issue new debt and reduced liquidity. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. 
 
 Because our industry is subject to rapid technological and therapeutic changes and new developments, our future success will depend on the continued viability of the use of stem cells. 
 39 

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance and expand the use of and utility of our services so that they gain increased market acceptance. There can be no assurance that expectant parents will use our services or that our services will provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies. Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes. Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells and our equipment obsolete and unmarketable. We may incur significant costs in replacing or modifying equipment in which we have already made a substantial investment prior to the end of its anticipated useful life. In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services we provide. 
 
 If our umbilical cord blood stem cell storage services do not achieve continued market acceptance, we will not be able to generate revenue necessary to support our business. 
 We anticipate that service fees from the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells will continue to comprise a substantial majority of our revenue in the future and, therefore, our future success depends on the successful and continued market acceptance of this service. Broad use and acceptance of our service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners, and the time and expense required to accomplish such education and awareness of our services and its potential benefits could adversely affect market acceptance. Successful commercialization of our services will also require that we satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of our services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for our services. If we are unable to continue to gain market acceptance of our services, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to remain profitable. 
 
 We may fail to successfully manufacture MSCs. 
 In August 2011, the Company introduced its advanced new cord tissue service, which stores a section of the umbilical cord tissue. Approximately six inches of the cord tissue is procured and transported to the Company s laboratory for processing, testing and cryopreservation for future potential use. Umbilical cord tissue is a rich source of mesenchymal stromal cells MSCs ). It is believed that MSCs have many unique functions including the ability to inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, to secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and to differentiate into many cell types including neural cells, bone cells, fat cells and cartilage. MSCs are increasingly being researched in regenerative medicine for a wide range of conditions are currently being used in many clinical trials. While there is much promise related to MSCs, we may fail to successfully or profitably manufacture and store MSCs, including as a result of negative results in clinical trials for efficacy. The outcome of clinical trials is inherently uncertain. 
 
 Clinical development is lengthy and uncertain. 
 Our public blood bank research involves clinical testing, which is expensive, complex and lengthy, and subject to various regulations, including the Common Rule. The Common Rule is a rule of ethics in the United States regarding biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects. It governed Institutional Review Boards for oversight of human research. It is encapsulated in the 1991 revision to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title 45 CFR 46 Subparts A, B, C and D. Subpart A. The outcome of clinical tries is inherently uncertain. There is a high rate of attrition for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials and most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. We may not be able to initiate, may experience delays in, or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational treatments. We and our strategic collaborators, including Duke, also may experience unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any clinical trials that we or they conduct that could delay or prevent us or them from successfully developing our investigational medicines and gaining approval from regulators. Delays or other events that might prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials include: 
 regulators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 

the outcome of our preclinical studies and our early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results; 

we may be unable to establish or achieve clinically meaningful endpoints for our studies; 

if we make changes to our investigational medicines after clinical trials have commenced (which we have done in the past), we may be required to repeat earlier stages or delay later stages of clinical testing; 

clinical trials of any investigational medicines may fail to show safety or efficacy, or produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or we may decide to abandon product development programs; and 

40 

regulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on a trial, or we or our investigators, IRBs, or ethics committees may elect to suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable benefit-risk ratio. 

Any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the FDA or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials. Further, the FDA or other regulators may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for clinical trials. Significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational treatments could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. 
 
 Our product candidates are subject to substantial government regulation, including the regulation of nonclinical testing and clinical trials. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues related to such product candidate will be negatively impacted. 
 Most of the product candidates we are developing must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process before they can be marketed in the United States or internationally. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may have to cease further development. Clinical trials on our product candidates are expected to take several years to fully complete. The commencement or completion of nonclinical studies or clinical trials can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including: 
 
 limitations directly caused by, or restrictions imposed in response to, the COVID-19 pandemic, including our ability to conduct research and development and clinical trials, to engage or continue to engage with third-party contractors and suppliers or to comply with regulatory obligations relating to our business; 

an inability to raise sufficient capital to commence, conduct, or complete clinical trials; 

findings in nonclinical trials; 

difficulties obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial; 

clinical trials also may be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the board overseeing the trial, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including: 

failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; 

inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

inspection of manufacturing and drug packaging operations by regulatory authorities; 

unforeseen safety issues or lack of effectiveness; and 

lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. 

We cannot assure you that clinical trials will demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of any of our product candidates, or will otherwise satisfy regulatory requirements. Our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, there may be inconsistencies between early clinical trial results and results obtained in later clinical trials, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their products. If we are unable to resolve the FDA s concerns, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for these product candidates. 
 The pre-marketing approval process can be particularly expensive, uncertain and lengthy, and a number of products for which FDA or other governmental regulatory approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing. In 
 41 

addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record-keeping procedures. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such violations could result in warning letters, non-approval, suspensions of regulatory approvals or ongoing clinical trials, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. 
 We may encounter such delays and rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authority may also adversely affect our business. Such delays or rejection may be encountered due to, among other reasons, government or regulatory delays, lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, or changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. More stringent regulatory approval processes in product clearance and enforcement activities could result in our experiencing longer approval cycles, more uncertainty, greater risk, and higher expenses. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval may entail limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted. It is possible, for example, that we may not receive FDA approval to market products based on our licensed, patented product candidates for different indications or to market updated products that represent extensions of our basic product candidates. In addition, we may not receive FDA approval to export our products based on our licensed, patented product candidates in the future, and countries to which products are to be exported may not approve them for import. 
 
 The stem cell preservation market is increasingly competitive. 
 Stem cell preservation is becoming an increasingly competitive business. Our business faces competition from other operators of stem cell preservation businesses and providers of stem storage services. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than us. Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter our markets and compete with us. In the event that we are not able to compete successfully, our business may be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for us to grow our revenue and maintain our existing business on terms that are favorable to us. 
 
 A failure in the performance of our cryopreservation storage facility or systems, or those of Duke could harm our business and reputation. 
 To the extent our cryopreservation storage service, or the storage by Duke with regard to our public cord blood specimens, is disrupted, discontinued or the performance is impaired, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Any failure, including network, software or hardware or equipment failure, that causes a material interruption or discontinuance in our cryopreservation storage of stem cell specimens could result in stored specimens being damaged and unable to be utilized. Specimen damage, including loss in transit to the Company or loss of bulk shipments to its secondary storage site, could result in litigation against us and reduced future revenue to us, which in turn could be harmful to our reputation. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our system or interruptions in our ability to maintain proper, continued, cryopreservation storage services. Any material disruption in our ability to maintain continued uninterrupted storage systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, equipment failure, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events for which we do not have redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan and may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. 
 
 Our future success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. 
 Our future success depends upon our ability to retain our key management and other personnel and will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified doctors, nurses, scientists, software developers, bioinformaticists, operations personnel, sales and marketing personnel, and business development personnel. Competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them, particularly in the Tampa Bay are of Florida, where our headquarters are located. We have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel, especially in the area of sales. Failure to attract, assimilate, and retain personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth.

 There is uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the Duke Arbitration Demand. 
 As discussed in Note 12, on October 4, 2024, the Company filed a demand for arbitration (the Arbitration Demand against Duke with the American Arbitration Association AAA ), alleging, among other things, that Duke breached the Duke License Agreement, breached the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulently induced the Company to enter the Duke License Agreement, and violated North Carolina s Unfair Trade Practices Act. In connection therewith, the Company has requested that the arbitrator enter an award in the Company s favor and against Duke for damages in an amount to be proved at a final hearing, interest, attorneys fees, and arbitration fees and costs, along with all other relief to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity. As of October 15, 2024, Duke has not responded to the Arbitration Demand. The Company cannot currently predict the outcome of the arbitration or Duke s response thereto, or the timing thereof. It is possible that Duke could assert affirmative defenses and counterclaims against the Company and that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of any claims asserted, which could negatively and materially impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and expensive and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail or how long such proceedings may last. The Company is not currently including an estimate of legal fees and other related litigation costs in its estimate of loss contingencies. 
 There is uncertainty with regard to whether we will be able to maximize shareholder value through the Duke License Agreement. 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company formed its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, Celle Corp., to hold certain assets of Cryo-Cell not directly associated with the recurring revenue stream from privately banked, umbilical cord blood specimens. The Duke License Agreement has been transferred to Celle Corp. and other assets and liabilities were expected to be transferred to Cell Corp. in connection therewith. As previously disclosed, the Company s Board of Directors has authorized the spin-off of Celle Corp. to the Company s shareholders and to explore all strategic alternatives for the Company (post spin-off) to maximize shareholder value. As discussed further in Note 12, on October 4, 2024, the Company filed the Arbitration Demand against Duke, alleging that Duke fraudulently induced Cryo-Cell to enter the Duke License Agreement and breached the agreement on various occasions. As result of the Arbitration Demand against Duke, there can be no assurance that any such the spinoff or any contemplated strategic alternatives will take place. Furthermore, as further discussed in Note 12, there can be no assurances the Company will be able to commercialize the rights licensed under the Duke License Agreement or otherwise obtain the benefits of the Duke License Agreement. Nor can there be any assurances it will open the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies. 
 We are not assured of recouping our damages related to the Arbitration Demand against Duke nor our investment in the Duke License Agreement. 
 On October 4, 2024, the Company filed the Arbitration Demand against Duke with the AAA, alleging, among other things, that Duke is in breach of the Duke License Agreement, breached the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulently induced the Company to enter into the Duke License Agreement, and violated North Carolina s Unfair Trade Practices Act. In connection therewith, the Company has requested that the arbitrator enter an award in the Company s favor and against Duke for damages in an amount to be proved at a final hearing, interest, attorneys fees, and arbitration fees and costs, along with all other relief to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity. Cryo-Cell has notified Duke that it believes such damages exceed 100 million. The Company cannot currently predict the outcome of the arbitration or Duke s response thereto. It is possible that Duke could assert affirmative defenses and counterclaims against the Company and that there could be an unfavorable outcome or resolution of any claims asserted, which could negatively and materially impact the Company s business, consolidated financial position and results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail. The Company may not be able to recover all or any of its damages or all or any of its investment in the Duke License Agreement. 
 
 Risk Related to Government Regulation 
 
 43 

If we do not obtain and maintain necessary domestic regulatory registrations, approvals and comply with ongoing regulations, we may not be able to market our services in the United States. 
 We are subject to substantial regulation. We are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Service Act because of our ongoing cellular storage business and are subject to FDA inspection. This requirement applies to all establishments engaged in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products HCT/Ps or the screening or testing of a cell or tissue donor. In addition, with the purchase of the manufacturing rights to the PrepaCyte CB Processing System on June 30, 2015, we are required to register this product as a Medical Device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which is also subject to FDA inspection. The Company is in compliance with these requirements, but not assurances can be made that we will be able to meet future regulatory requirements. The division of FDA which regulates HCT/Ps is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER ). Since 2004, the FDA has formulated a Tissue Action Plan which consists of these three rules: 
 
 1. As of January 21, 2004, all cord blood banks are required to register with the FDA. Any cord blood bank which has a laboratory should be on the web page of FDA Registered Establishments. 

2. The second rule was published May 20, 2004, and became effective May 25, 2005. It pertains to donor eligibility. This rule requires more screening of donors for communicable diseases. 

3. The final rule establishes FDA standards of current Good Tissue Practice GTP for laboratories which process HCT/Ps. This rule was published November 19, 2004, became effective May 25, 2005, and is intended to prevent contamination or cross-contamination during the handling of HCT/Ps. 

The final rule allows the FDA to inspect cord blood laboratories to determine compliance with the provisions of 21 CFR Part 1271. As part of this oversight authority, the FDA conducts unannounced inspections of cord blood banks. 
 Upon execution of the acquisition of all of the assets of Cord:Use, the Company acquired the cord blood operations which included both public (PHS 351) and private (PHS 361) banks. The new PHS 351 product is distributed under an IND (10-CBA) maintained by the NMDP. The Company has continued the contract with Duke initiated by Cord:Use to manufacture, test, cryopreserve, store and distribute the public cord blood units. The units are listed on the NMDP Single Point of Access Registry and are available to transplant centers worldwide. The Company is reimbursed via cost recovery for public cord blood units distributed for transplant through the NMDP. The donation of cord blood units in the public cord blood banking program functions under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA and the Company adheres to HIPAA rules. The FDA does not require establishments that manufacture drugs (including biological products) and devices that are HCT/Ps for use under an investigational new drug application (IND) (21 CFR Part 312) to register and list their HCT/Ps until the HCT/P is approved through a biologics license application (BLA), new drug application (NDA), or premarket approval application (PMA); or cleared through a premarket notification submission (510(k)). 
 The PrepaCyte CB (Cord Blood) Processing System is intended for use in cell processing laboratories to process and store total nucleated cells (TNC) from human umbilical cord blood, prior to banking. The device is composed of a bag with separation media. The system is 510(k) cleared as a Class II device. The division of the FDA which regulates this product is the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER ). Approval to market the device was determined by the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies. The section of FDA Code of Federal Regulations CFR pertaining to medical device is 21 CFR 800s. The requirements for compliance to this section include annual registration of the device, listing of devices with the FDA, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. 
 Currently, the states of California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and New York require cord blood banks to be registered or licensed. The Company is currently registered or licensed to operate in these states. If the Company identifies other states with licensing requirements or if other states adopt such requirements, the Company would have to obtain licenses or registration to continue providing cord blood services in those states. 
 The Company is also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. These laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ), cGTPs, cGMPs, Environmental Protection Act and those of the local Department of Health. 
 Evolving legislation and regulations governing private cord blood banking in various jurisdictions throughout the world may impact the Company s international licensees. 
 In addition, as the organization grows and evolves, other legislation and regulations are expected to impact the Company. One such evolution involves activities that may be designated as or involve medical research or cooperative agreements associated with 
 44 

medical research. These types of activities are also governed by the FDA, specifying oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a board or committee that approves the initiation of, and conducts periodic review of, biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of such review is to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Governance of biomedical research is codified as laws by Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56, and enforced by the FDA. Other medical research associated with clinical trials may require an Investigational New Drug Application (IND). Current Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because a sponsor will likely want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in many states, it must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The IND is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA. This approval would be required in the case of a clinical trial. 
 
 We may be required to spend substantial amounts to comply with legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy. 
 Regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, contain provisions that require us to adopt business procedures designed to protect the privacy of each of our patients individual health information. Federal and state laws govern the Company s ability to obtain and, in some cases, to use and disclose data that we may need to conduct certain activities. The HIPAA requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a series of regulations establishing standards for the electronic transmission of certain health information. The Company s private cord blood bank operation is not subject to HIPAA because the Company does not engage in certain electronic transactions related to the reimbursement of healthcare providers and because blood and tissue procurement and banking activities are exempt. However, the healthcare providers that collect umbilical cord blood for the Company s customers are subject to HIPAA. The identifiable information shared is only what is permitted by HIPAA. In 2009, a portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH Act ). While the Company is still not subject to HIPAA for the reasons stated above the Company may incur material expenses associated with compliance efforts. In addition, compliance may require management to spend substantial time and effort on compliance measures. If the Company fails to comply with HIPAA, it is possible it could suffer criminal and civil penalties. The civil penalties could include monetary penalties ranging from 100 per violation to 1.5 million depending on the level of violation. 
 
 Our failure to comply with laws related to hazardous materials could materially harm us. 
 We are subject to state and federal laws regulating the protection of employees who may be exposed to hazardous material and regulating the proper handling and disposal of that material. There are inherent risks in connection with the handling, storage, disposal, distribution, and/or use of the specimens. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulation and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. Individuals who use or come in contact with the specimens may file claims related to their use and these claims could result in litigation that could be expensive to defend or result in judgements that exceed our resources and our insurance coverage. Any such litigations and judgement could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws, a violation of such laws, or the future enactment of more stringent laws or regulations, could subject us to liability, or require us to incur costs that would have an adverse effect on us. 
 
 Risks Related to International Operations 
 
 Our international operations are subject to risk and we may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property. 
 International licenses of our technology and services account for a portion of our income and our international growth may be limited if we are unable to successfully manage our international activities. We are subject to a number of challenges that relate to our international business activities. Our growth and future license income and return on investments from these sources will be impacted by these challenges, which include: 
 
 failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights; 

certain laws and business practices that could prevent our business from operating or favor local competitors, which could slow or limit our growth in international markets; 

entering into licensing agreements with organizations capable of undertaking and sustaining operations; 

the expense of entering into licensing and investment arrangements in new foreign markets; 

45 

changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely affect our business; 

risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign import requirements, including the importation and exportation of our solutions, as well as changes in trade, tariffs, restrictions or requirements; 

heightened risks of unethical, unfair or corrupt business practices, actual or claimed, in certain geographies; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may make doing business with us less appealing as our contracts are generally denominated in U.S. dollars; 

greater difficulty in enforcing contracts; 

lack of brand awareness that can make commercializing our products more difficult and expensive; 

management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion; 

the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

potentially different pricing environments, longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud; 

uncertainty regarding liability for products and services, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent; 

different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions; and 

compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations applicable to international operations may increase the cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy requirements, research ethics and compliance laws, anti-corruption laws, and anti- competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. 

The occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our international business and, consequently, our results of operations. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. 
 
 We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 
 
 46 

The Company s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. 
 Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions, such as the current Ukrainian-Russian conflict could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, cellular network carriers and other partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company s business. 
 The Ukrainian-Russian conflict has caused market volatility, a sharp increase in certain commodity prices, such as wheat and oil, and an increasing number and frequency of cybersecurity threats. So far, we have not experienced any direct impact from the conflict and, as our business is conducted primarily in the United States, we are probably less vulnerable than companies with international operations. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the situation carefully and, if necessary, take action to protect our business, operations and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Information Technology 
 
 Our information systems are critical to our business, and a failure of those systems could materially harm us. 
 We depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information. If our information systems fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 If we experience a significant breach of data security or disruption in our information systems, our business could be adversely affected. 
 We rely on various information systems to manage our operations and to store information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable information. These systems have been and continue to be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction, including due to events beyond our control, and to unauthorized access, computer hackers, ransomware, viruses, and other security problems. Failure of these systems or any significant breach of our data security could have an adverse effect on our business and may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 Data security breaches could result in loss or misuse of information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, compelled compliance with breach notification laws, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Companies throughout our industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks or sensitive information. While we have implemented and continue to implement cybersecurity safeguards and procedures, these safeguards have been vulnerable to attack. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our cybersecurity measures or to investigate or remediate any vulnerabilities or breaches. 
 Although we maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the event of a breach or disruption of certain of our information systems, we cannot ensure that the coverage is adequate to compensate for any damages that may be incurred. 
 
 Increasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage. 
 We and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communication both internally and externally. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image, and goodwill. 
 
 Some of our products contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies, products and services in a manner that could harm our business. 
 We use open source software in our products and anticipate using open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software 
 47 

licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, we could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend significant additional research and development resources, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful. 
 Additionally, the use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our developers for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our products. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates throughout the world could be expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. We do not have any registered patents. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. 
 If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market will be harmed. There can be no assurance that we will not become subject to future patent infringement claims or litigation in a court of law, interference proceedings, or opposition to a patent granted in a foreign jurisdiction. The defense and prosecution of such intellectual property claims are costly, time-consuming, divert the attention of management and technical personnel and could result in substantial cost and uncertainty regarding our future viability. Future litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could result in substantial cost and uncertainty, may also be necessary to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights. Any public announcements related to such litigation or regulatory proceedings that we initiate, or that are initiated or threatened against us by our competitors, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we typically require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. Failure to protect our intellectual property would limit our ability to produce and/or market our products in the future and would likely have an adverse effect on the revenues generated by the sale or license of such intellectual property. 
 
 We may become subject to third parties claims alleging infringement of their patents and proprietary rights, which could be costly, time consuming, and prevent the use of our technology solution. 
 We cannot assure you that third parties will not claim our current or future products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could cause costly litigation that could consume significant management time. As the number of product and services offerings in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap, companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. These claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If required, we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements or obtain them on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 If our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our platforms, our platforms and applications may be perceived as not being secure, customers and suppliers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. 
 48 

Our storage systems and the network infrastructure that are hosted by third-party providers involve the storage and transmission of healthcare data as well as proprietary information about organizations and programs, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, security flaws in the third-party hosting service that we rely upon, or any number of other reasons and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our suppliers or customers data. Although we have never had any breach of data in our third-party provider s environment, any future breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our platforms and applications that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose suppliers and customers and we may have difficulty obtaining merchant processors or insurance coverage essential for our operations. 
 
 Risks Related to being a Public Company 
 
 We incur significant costs and demands as a result of operating as a public company. 
 We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to meet our obligations as a publicly traded company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that are not currently anticipated. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and could cause our business or stock price to suffer. 
 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires, subject to an exemption for so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance ESG policies and practices may cause us to incur additional costs or expose us to additional risks. 
 There has been increasing public focus and scrutiny from investors, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and customers on corporate ESG practices. Our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all parties could cause harm to our 
 49 

business and reputation and have a negative impact on the market price of our securities. New government regulations could also result in new regulations and new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may lead to increased expenditures for sustainability initiatives. 
 
 Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert 
 significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. 
 Based upon shares of common stock outstanding as of August 31, 2024, our executive officers, directors, 5 stockholders (known to us through publicly available information) and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 52 of our voting stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to substantially influence us through this ownership position. For example, these stockholders, if they choose to act together, may be able to influence the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. 
 
 We may become subject to securities class action litigation, which can be expensive, divert management attention, and, if resolved unfavorably, expose us to significant liabilities. 
 We may become subject to litigation in the future that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s resources and attention. In addition, any adverse determination from future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, meaning that we have a public float of less than 250 million, have annual revenues of less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the value of our voting and nonvoting common stock held by non-affiliates on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter in that fiscal year is less than 700.0 million. As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects. 
 
 We are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors. 
 Should our officers and/or directors require us to contribute to their defense, we may be required to spend significant amounts of our capital. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, also provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney s fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on behalf of our company. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup. If these expenditures are significant or involve issues which result in significant liability for our key personnel, we may be unable to continue operating as a going concern. 
 
 Certain provision of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that public stockholders might consider in their best interest. 
 Certain provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. 
 
 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that: 

authorize the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank-check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by the board of directors; 

establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; 

50 

limit who may call stockholder meetings; 

require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent; 

provide that the board may increase the size of our board of directors and authorize the board to fill any vacancies on our board of directors by a majority of directors then in office; 

authorize us to indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures; and 

establish the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, unless the Corporation consents to an alternative forum, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain for any current or former shareholder (including a current or former beneficial owner) to bring any claim relating to an internal matter, other than as to any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. 

Delaware anti-takeover statute. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless: 

prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; or 

upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder, (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 

Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder and an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15 or more of a corporation s outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that Section 203 may discourage business combinations or other attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders. The provisions of DGCL, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
