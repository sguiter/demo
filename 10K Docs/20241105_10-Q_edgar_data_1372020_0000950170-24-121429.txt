 operating segment which is also the Company s reportable segment and reporting unit of which the Company tests goodwill for impairment. When conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill, the Company can choose to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment determines an impairment is more likely than not, the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. Otherwise, no further analysis is required. The Company also may elect to forego the qualitative and move directly to the quantitative impairment test. The Company performed its annual test of impairment as of July 1, 2024. The Company assessed qualitative factors for any indications of potential impairment of the reporting unit. Upon completing this assessment, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value as of the assessment date and, as a result, a quantitative test was not performed. The Company will continue to monitor for changes in facts or circumstances that may impact its estimates. The Company will perform its next scheduled annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter of 2025 should no triggering events occur which would require a test prior to the next annual test. The condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) ASU 2023-09 ). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. One of the amendments in ASU 2023-09 includes disclosure of, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation of (i) the reported income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations, to (ii) the product of the income (or loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate of the jurisdiction of domicile using specific categories, including separate disclosure for any reconciling items within certain categories that are equal to or greater than a specified quantitative threshold of . ASU 2023-09 also requires disclosure of, on an annual basis, the year to date amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions, including additional disaggregated information on income taxes paid (net of refunds received) to an individual jurisdiction equal to or greater than of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied prospectively. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) ASU 2023-07 ). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. ASU 2023-07 requires a public entity to report a measure of segment profit or loss that the chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses to assess segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources. ASU 2023-07 also requires other specified segment items and amounts, such as depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense, to be disclosed under certain circumstances. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 also do not

For the first following the Closing Date, the Company may prepay all or a part of the loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement by paying the principal amount of the loans to be prepaid plus a customary make-whole premium, subject to a make-whole carveout of up to million (less the amount of any undrawn delayed draw term loan commitments at such time) at with proceeds from a qualifying Maritime Administration MARAD financing. Thereafter, the Company may prepay all or a part of the loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement by paying, (i) in months 19-30 following the Closing Date, of the principal amount of the loans to be prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) in months 31 to 42 after the Closing Date, of the principal amount of loans to be prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Second Lien Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (including non-payment of principal or interest on any material debt and breaches of covenants) as well as events of default relating to certain actions by the Company s surety bonding providers. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each borrower (other than the Company) and subsidiary guarantor under the ABL Credit Agreement (as defined below), each existing or future issuer or guarantor under the indenture governing the Company s Senior Notes due 2029, and each other existing and subsequently acquired or formed material direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of the Company. The loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement funded on the Closing Date were used to repay amounts outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement, to pay fees and expenses associated with the transactions and for general corporate purposes, including to fund upcoming new build payments. The delayed draw portion of the term loans, if funded, will be used to fund future new build payments, ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

Interest on the term loan facility under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is equal to either a base rate option Base Rate Loan or a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR option Term SOFR Loan at the Company s election. In the case of a Base Rate Loan, interest on the unpaid principal amount shall equal (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in the United States as quoted from time to time by The Wall Street Journal or the highest per annum rate of interest published by the Federal Reserve Board, (b) the federal funds effective rate (but not less than zero) plus and (c) Term SOFR for a one-month interest period on such day, plus , plus (ii) .

Credit agreement On April 24, 2024, the Credit Parties, PNC Bank, National Association PNC ), as agent for the lenders, and certain financial institutions party thereto entered into an amendment to the ABL Credit Agreement described below (the ABL Amendment ). The ABL Amendment (w) eliminates the Company s ability to increase the commitments under the senior secured revolving credit facility (x) modifies the pricing of loans and undrawn commitments as summarized below, (y) adds a minimum liquidity covenant, for so long as the Second Lien Credit Agreement has not been prepaid and terminated, that requires the Credit Parties to maintain consolidated liquidity of (a) million at any time the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period is less than to 1.00 and (b) million at any time the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters is greater than or equal to to 1.00 and (z) makes certain other customary changes in connection with the Credit Parties entry into the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Company has availability of up to million for the issuance of letters of credit under the ABL Amendment. The ABL Amendment modifies the Applicable Margin for Advances as follows: (i) following the ABL Amendment closing date through and including the date immediately prior to the date on which the Borrowing Base Certificate is required to be delivered for most recently completed fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2024) (the Adjustment Date ), (a) the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans Advances is and (b) the Applicable Margins for Term SOFR Rate Loans Advances is , (ii) beginning as of the Adjustment Date, to the extent the quarterly average undrawn availability for the prior fiscal quarter is (x) greater than of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, (a) the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans Advances is and (b) the Applicable Margins for Term SOFR Rate Loans Advances is ; (y) to the extent the quarterly average undrawn availability for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount but greater than , (a) the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans Advances is and (b) the Applicable Margins for Term SOFR Rate Loans Advances is ; and (z) to the extent the quarterly average undrawn availability for the prior fiscal quarter is less than or equal to of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, (a) Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans Advances is and (b) the Applicable Margin for Term SOFR Rate Loans Advances is . Additionally, the Company has an option to borrow at Green Loan Advance Rates, each of which will be lower than the corresponding applicable rate if the Company certifies that it will use such proceeds to invest in renewable energy and clean transportation projects and it complies with green loan principles.

The ABL Credit Agreement contains a green loan option where the Company can borrow at the lower interest rates described below so long as such funds are used to fund capital investments related to renewable energy and clean transportation projects and are consistent with green loan principles. The green loan option is subject to a million sublimit. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including a springing financial covenant that requires the Credit Parties to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, net interest expenses, non-cash charges and losses and certain other non-recurring charges, minus capital expenditures, income and franchise taxes, to net cash interest expense plus scheduled cash principal payments with respect to debt plus restricted payments paid in cash) of not less than to 1.00. of the maximum loan amount for five consecutive days. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (including non-payment of principal or interest on any material debt and breaches of covenants) as well as events of default relating to certain actions by the Company s surety bonding providers. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the ABL Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each existing and subsequently acquired or formed material direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of the Company. Borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement will be used to pay fees and expenses related to the ABL Credit Agreement, finance acquisitions permitted under the ABL Credit Agreement, finance ongoing working capital, for other general corporate purposes, and with respect to any green loan, fund capital investments related to renewable energy and clean transportation projects. The ABL Credit Agreement matures on the earlier of July 29, 2027 or the date that is ninety-one (91) days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Company s unsecured senior notes, which is currently June 1, 2029, if the Company fails to refinance its unsecured senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity date but only if such scheduled maturity date is prior to the maturity date of the ABL Credit Agreement.

Fuel hedge contracts The Company is exposed to certain market risks, primarily commodity price risk as it relates to diesel fuel purchase requirements, which occur in the normal course of business. The Company enters into heating oil commodity swap contracts to hedge the risk that fluctuations in diesel fuel prices could have an adverse impact on cash flows associated with its domestic dredging contracts. The Company s goal is to hedge approximately of the eligible fuel requirements for work in dredging backlog. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was party to various swap arrangements to hedge the price of a portion of its diesel fuel purchase requirements for work in its backlog to be performed through February 2026. As of September 30, 2024, there were million gallons remaining on these contracts representing forecasted domestic fuel purchases through February 2026. Under these swap agreements, the Company will pay fixed prices ranging from to per gallon. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value liabilities of the fuel hedge contracts were estimated to be million and million, respectively, and are recorded in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For fuel hedge contracts considered to be highly effective, the losses reclassified to earnings from changes in fair value of derivatives, net of cash settlements and taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were . The remaining gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified into earnings over the next seventeen months, corresponding to the period during which the hedged fuel is expected to be utilized. Changes in the fair value of fuel hedge contracts not considered highly effective are recorded as cost of contract revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of fuel hedges are corroborated using inputs that are readily observable in public markets; therefore, the Company determines fair value of these fuel hedges using Level 2 inputs.

million Euro of payments remaining on these hedge contracts. Under these hedge contracts, the Company will pay fixed prices ranging from to per Euro. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value liability of foreign currency exchange hedge contracts was and is recorded in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value asset of foreign currency exchange hedge contracts was and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For foreign currency exchange hedge contracts considered to be highly effective, the losses reclassified to earnings from changes in fair value of derivatives, net of cash settlements and taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were . The remaining gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified into earnings over the next two months, corresponding to the period during which the hedged currency is expected to be utilized. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedge contracts not considered highly effective are recorded as other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of foreign currency exchange hedges are corroborated using inputs that are readily observable in public markets; therefore, the Company determines the fair value of these foreign currency exchange hedges using Level 2 inputs. Interest rate swaps The Company is exposed to certain market risks, including interest rate risks related to the floating interest rates on its variable rate debt. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable rate debt into fixed-rate debt and hedge the risk that fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse impact on net interest expense. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was party to interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million effective August 5, 2024 and a maturity date of . Under these interest rate swaps, the Company will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 3.873 on the notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 30-day SOFR rate, effectively modifying the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of its floating-rate debt to a weighted average fixed interest rate of 11.623 . As of September 30, 2024 the fair value liability of the Company s interest rate swaps was and is recorded in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For interest rate swaps considered to be highly effective, the gains reclassified to earnings from changes in fair value of derivatives, net of cash settlements and taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were . The remaining gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified into earnings over the next twenty three months, corresponding to the period during which the interest rate swap is expected to be utilized. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps not considered highly effective are recorded as interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of interest rate swaps are corroborated using inputs that are readily observable in public markets; therefore, the Company determines the fair value of these interest rate swaps using Level 2 inputs.

Other financial instruments The carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Based on timing of the cash flows and comparison to current market interest rates, the carrying values of the ABL Amendment and Second Lien Credit Agreement approximate fair value at September 30, 2024. In May 2021, the Company sold 325.0 million of the 2029 Notes, which were outstanding at September 30, 2024 (see Note 5, Long-term debt). The fair value of the 2029 Notes was million at September 30, 2024, which is a Level 1 fair value measurement as the senior notes value was obtained using quoted prices in active markets. It is impracticable to determine the fair value of outstanding letters of credit or performance, bid and payment bonds due to uncertainties as to the amount and timing of future obligations, if any.

 General 
 Great Lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States which is complemented with a long history of performing significant international projects. The Company is also fully engaged in expanding its core business into the rapidly developing offshore wind energy industry. The Company operates in one operating segment, which is also the Company s one reportable segment and reporting unit. 
 Dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, the Company's work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers lakes. 
 The Company s bid market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations bid market ). The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 33 over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, including 36 , 56 , 23 and 22 of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers lakes sectors, respectively, exclusive of liquefied natural gas LNG projects. 
 The Company s largest domestic customer is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps ), which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company s dredging revenues earned from contracts with federal government agencies, including the Corps as well as other federal entities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, were approximately 61 of dredging revenues, which is below the average of the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 of 74 . The decrease in the federal government revenue percentage is a result of additional revenues from state and local governments and private customers in the first nine months of 2024. 
 The Company s vessels are subject to periodic regulatory dry dock inspections to verify that the vessels have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the U.S. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping ABS and that recommended repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Regulatory dry dock frequency is a statutory requirement mandated by the U.S. Coast Guard and the ABS. The Company s vessels undergo regulatory dry-docks every two to three years or every five years, depending on the vessel type and may also go into dry dock on an as-needed basis for upgrades, maintenance and repairs. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company commenced a regulatory dry dock inspection on one dredge, which was completed in the fourth quarter. By comparison, the 
 19 

Company did not dry dock any vessels for regulatory inspections and dry docked one vessel for maintenance and repairs in the third quarter of 2023. The Company does not have any regulatory dry dock inspections planned for the remainder of 2024. 
 As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company had one dredge cold stacked. The cold stacked equipment can be easily reactivated when market conditions are favorable for the Company. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company began the reactivation of one of the previously cold stacked vessels in anticipation of commencing a contract in 2025. 
 The Company continues to tender bids on several pending LNG projects in an effort to diversify and expand its client base. Included in the Company s backlog are two LNG projects that were awarded in 2023, the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project and the Brownsville Ship Channel project for Next Decade Corporation s Rio Grande LNG project, which is the largest project undertaken in Great Lakes' history. Dredging began on both capital projects during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Company plans to participate in the offshore wind market, and in November 2021, the Company entered into a 197 million contract with Philly Shipyard to build the first U.S. flagged Jones Act compliant, inclined fall-pipe vessel for subsea rock installation for wind turbine foundations, the Acadia , which is expected to be delivered and operational in the second half of 2025. This vessel represents a significant critical advancement in building the U.S. logistics infrastructure to support the future of the new U.S. offshore wind industry. Offshore wind has been recognized around the world as a reliable source of renewable energy. The Company continues to pursue and tender bids, both domestically and internationally, for multiple offshore wind projects for the Acadia , to protect and stabilize offshore wind structures, cables and pipelines. 
 The offshore wind market reached historic milestones in the first quarter of 2024, with two commercial-scale offshore wind farms becoming operational and supplying power to the grid in New York and Massachusetts. New Jersey also awarded 3.7 gigawatts GW of Power Purchase Agreements in January 2024. On September 6, 2024, Massachusetts awarded 2.7 GW in total, which included 1.1 GW on the SouthCoast Wind project, 0.8 GW on New England Wind 1 and up to 0.8 GW on the Vineyard Wind 2 project, with Rhode Island awarding the remaining 0.2 GW on the SouthCoast Wind project. These projects are expected to power over 125,000 Rhode Island homes and 1.4 million Massachusetts homes. 
 
 In February 2024, the Vineyard Wind project, located about 14 miles off Martha s Vineyard, completed installation of five turbines and is supplying power to the New England grid, while continuing to install additional turbines. In March 2024, the South Fork Wind project was completed, with all 12 offshore wind turbines constructed and the wind farm successfully delivering power to Long Island and the Rockaways. In June 2024, Equinor and rsted finalized power deals with New York State Energy Research Development Authority for the Empire Wind I and Sunrise Wind projects. Notably, the Company has been awarded rock installation contracts for both projects, and expects to be using the Acadia to protect and stabilize foundations and cables for these projects with combined capacity of 1.7 GW. On July 17, 2024, construction began on the Sunrise Wind project which is expected to provide power to approximately 600,000 New York homes. Additionally, in July 2024, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction and operation of two offshore wind energy facilities, New England Wind 1 and 2, which are estimated to power close to a million homes. Atlantic Shores 1 and 2 Construction and Operations Plans were approved in October for 2.8 GW, which are estimated to power more than 1 million New Jersey homes. 
 
 The U.S. offshore wind development and operational pipeline expanded by 53 over the past year, now boasting a potential generating capacity of approximately 80.5 GW. This growth is attributed to new leasing areas and heightened sector investment. In addition to the U.S. offshore wind market, there are several other market opportunities that the Acadia is well suited for, such as rock placement in the international offshore wind market, rock protection over pipelines in the oil and gas and carbon capture markets and telecommunications and power cable protection. As such, we continue to pursue and bid on a number of other offshore wind farm and cable and pipeline protection projects for the Acadia , both domestically and internationally, with work planned for 2026 and beyond. 
 Post quarter end, we signed a vessel reservation agreement for the Acadia with an offshore wind developer for a project in the United States. This reservation agreement further demonstrates the unique proposition we bring to the U.S. offshore wind market and provides visibility for additional potential utilization.

Adjusted EBITDA , as provided herein, represents net income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment, accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company s operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company s primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company s period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a transparent measure of the Company s recurring operating performance and allows management and investors to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company s incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company s use of Adjusted EBITDA, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company s business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income to measure the Company s operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement.

Total revenue was 191.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 74.0 million, or 63 , from 117.2 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue was 559.9 million, up 152.0 million, or 37 , from 407.9 million for the same period in the prior year. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced a significant increase in domestic capital and coastal protection revenues, due to a significant increase in capital and coastal protection project awards and the delivery of the Galveston Island , the Company s newest hopper dredge which began operations in February 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rivers lakes revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreases in maintenance and rivers lakes revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, domestic capital dredging revenue was 108.7 million, up 54.1 million, or 99 , compared to 54.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, domestic capital dredging revenue was 249.3 million, up 124.1 million, or 99 , compared to 125.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in capital dredging revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly due to a higher amount of revenue earned on projects in Texas in the current year periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue earned on projects in Virginia and Florida in the current year periods. 
 Coastal protection projects involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Coastal protection revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 43.9 million, an increase of 20.3 million, or 86 , compared to 23.6 million in the prior year period. The increase in coastal protection revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in the amount of revenue earned on projects in Florida in the current year when compared to the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue earned on projects in New York and New Jersey in the current quarter. Coastal protection revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 178.0 million, an increase of 46.6 million, or 36 , compared to 131.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in coastal protection revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in revenue earned on projects in Florida and Alabama in the current year when compared to the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue earned on projects in New York and New Jersey in the current year to date period. 
 Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, most channels generally require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging. Maintenance revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 37.9 million, up 4.1 million, or 12 , from 33.8 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in maintenance revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly attributable to an increase in revenue earned on a project in Puerto Rico when compared with prior year quarter. Maintenance revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 130.7 million, down 10.9 million, or 8 , from 141.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease in maintenance revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue earned on projects in North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama when compared with prior year quarter. This decrease was offset by an increase in revenue earned on projects in Louisiana, Mississippi and Puerto Rico in the same period in the prior year. 
 Rivers lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, rivers lakes revenue was 0.7 million, a decrease of 4.5 million, or 86 , from 5.2 million during the same period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, rivers lakes revenue was 1.8 million, a decrease of 7.9 million, or 
 22 

81 , from 9.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease in river lakes revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly attributable to a decrease in revenue earned on projects in Tennessee and Arkansas as compared to same periods of 2023. 
 Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.2 million, up 27.2 million, or 302 , compared to 9.0 million in same period of 2023. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 19.0 from 7.7 in the same period in the prior year. Consolidated gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 111.6 million, up 72.5 million, or 185 , compared to 39.1 million in the same period in the prior year. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 19.9 from 9.6 in the same period in the prior year. The higher gross profit and profit margins experienced for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by increased revenues as well as improved utilization and project performance in the current year quarter. Additionally, the project mix during the current year periods include a larger proportion of higher margin capital and coastal protection projects than the same periods in the prior year. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 19.8 million and 52.1 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year in which the three and nine month periods totaled 14.2 million and 41.7 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses include higher incentive compensation and employee benefit expenses, partially offset by lower severance and office expenses. 
 Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was 16.7 million, up 21.8 million from an operating loss of 5.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.8 million, up 65.1 million from an operating loss of 2.3 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of higher gross profit in the current year periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses in the current year periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Gains on the sale of assets in the current period also contributed to the increase in operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest expense was 4.9 million, 2.1 million higher compared to 2.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.0 million, 3.7 million higher compared to 9.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher borrowings and the execution of the Second Lien Credit Agreement during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.2 million compared to an income tax benefit of 1.8 million for the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax provision was 13.0 million compared to an income tax benefit of 1.8 million in the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.7 , while the effective tax rate for the same period of 2023 was 19.1 . The lower effective tax rate incurred in 2023 was primarily due to near break-even net loss offset by lower deductions for stock compensation in that period. 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million, up 15.1 million from a net loss of 6.2 million in the same period in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was 0.13 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a diluted loss per share of 0.09 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.5 million, an increase of 45.2 million, or 587 , from a net loss of 7.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was 0.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a diluted loss per share of 0.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the substantial improvement to operating income in the current year periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year, partially offset by increases in net interest expense and the income tax provision in the current year periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.0 million, up 21.7 million, from 5.3 million in the same quarter in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the increase in gross profit, excluding depreciation partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Adjusted EBITDA was 95.7 million, up 63.5 million, from 32.2 million during the same period in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the increase in gross profit, excluding depreciation, as well as an increased income tax provision in the current period, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense.

Total dredging backlog does not include 465.0 million of domestic low bids pending formal award and additional phases options pending on projects currently in dredging backlog at September 30, 2024. Additionally, it does not include 44.9 million of performance obligations or 12.7 million of options pending award related to offshore wind contracts. The Company expects to perform on its offshore wind contracts using the Acadia , which is expected to be delivered and operational in the second half of 2025. 
 The Company s contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. These estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site, the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work. However, these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances. Because of these factors, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job, backlog is not always indicative of future revenues or profitability. Additionally, 50 of our September 30, 2024 dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts, which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government, subject to our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. Our backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects we are awarded from the bid market. A quarterly increase or decrease of our backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of our business. Our backlog includes only those projects for which we have obtained a signed contract with the customer. 
 The 2024 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, which passed in the first quarter, provided a record 8.7 billion in total funding to the Corps for fiscal year 2024. This funding included 5.6 billion for the Corps Operations and Maintenance work and 2.8 billion for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to maintain and modernize our nation s waterways. In 2023, the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act was also approved which included 1.5 billion for the Corps to make necessary repairs to infrastructure impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, and to initiate beach renourishment projects that will increase coastal resiliency. This increased budget and additional funding have supported a strong bid market 2024, with a robust beach renourishment market and several capital projects. 
 The 2025 Corps budget is expected to be another record appropriation. On June 28, 2024, disthe U.S. House of Representatives (the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee passed their 2025 Appropriations Bill providing the Corps with a budget of 9.96 billion, which is 2.7 billion above the President s Budget request. The bill includes 5.7 billion for Operations and Maintenance projects, of which 3.1 billion is from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. On August 1, 2024, the Senate Appropriation Committee approved its draft of the 2025 Energy and Water spending bill which provides 10.3 billion in total funding for the Corps. On September 25, 2024, President Biden approved a continuing resolution through December 20, 2024 for the Corps fiscal year 2025 budget. 
 The Water Resources Development Act WRDA is on a two-year renewal cycle and includes legislation that authorizes the financing of Corps projects for studies, flood and hurricane protection, dredging, ecosystem restoration and other construction projects aimed at improving rivers and harbors in the United States. WRDA 2022 featured authorization for the New York and New Jersey shipping channels to be deepened to 55 feet, as well as the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Program, which aims to protect the Texas Gulf Coast from hurricanes. WRDA 2024 appears to have strong bipartisan support and has already been approved by the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The House and Senate approved their versions of WRDA 2024 on July 22, 2024 and August 1, 2024, respectively. Currently, the two chambers are working to reconcile the differences in their respective versions of the bill and, once completed, the final version will be sent to the President to be signed into law.

The domestic dredging bid market for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 1.31 billion, a 454.9 million increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Total domestic dredging bid market for the current year period included awards for seven domestic capital projects, seven coastal protection projects, nine maintenance projects, and two river maintenance projects. The total domestic dredging bid market through September 30, 2024 was 2.49 billion, of which the Company won 30 , which is close to the Company s average of 33 for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. The third quarter and year-to-date domestic dredging bid market totals do not include LNG or offshore wind projects. Variability in contract wins from quarter to quarter is not unusual and one quarter s win rate is generally not indicative of the win rate the Company is likely to achieve for a full year. 
 The Company s contracted dredging backlog was 1.21 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.04 billion of dredging backlog at December 31, 2023. Total dredging backlog does not include 465.0 million of domestic low bids pending formal award and options pending on projects currently in dredging backlog at September 30, 2024. Additionally, it does not include 44.9 million of performance obligations or 12.7 million of options pending award related to offshore wind contracts. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company was awarded additional projects totaling approximately 90 million. At December 31, 2023, the total dredging backlog does not include 44.6 million of performance obligations related to offshore wind contracts or 179.4 million of domestic low bids pending formal award and options pending on projects in dredging backlog as of that date. Included in the Company s backlog at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are two LNG projects, including the Brownsville Ship Channel project for Next Decade Corporation s Rio Grande LNG project, which is the largest project undertaken in the Company's history, and the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project for Marine Dredging and Disposal. Dredging on both capital projects began during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Domestic capital dredging backlog at September 30, 2024 was 898.9 million, an increase of 157.1 million from December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was awarded four domestic capital dredging projects in Florida, Alabama, Virginia and Texas totaling 389.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to earn revenue on deepening projects in Virginia and Texas. These deepenings continue the trend of ensuring all East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports will be able to accommodate the deeper draft vessels currently used on several trade routes. The nation s governors continue to show commitment to their respective ports through engagement and funding. Finally, Congress has also shown a commitment to ports and waterways, providing record annual budgets for the Corps for port deepening and channel maintenance. In addition to this port work, a greater amount of coastal restoration and rehabilitation projects are being funded in the Gulf Coast region as the states utilize available monies for ecosystem priorities, a portion of which is allocated to dredging. 
 Coastal protection dredging backlog at September 30, 2024 was 218.3 million, an increase of 79.9 million from December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was awarded seven coastal protection projects in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Florida totaling 327.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to earn revenue on coastal protection projects in New York, New Jersey, Alabama and Florida, which were in dredging backlog at December 31, 2023. Coastal protection and storm impacts continue to provide the major impetus for coastal project investment at federal and state levels. Strong hurricane and storm seasons have resulted in an increase in beach erosion and other damage which adds to the recurring nature of our business and the need for more frequent coastal protection and port maintenance projects. 
 Maintenance dredging backlog at September 30, 2024 was 89.1 million, a decrease of 63.1 million from December 31, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was awarded two maintenance projects for a total of 18.1 million in Florida and Texas. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to earn revenue on projects in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Florida that were in dredging backlog at December 31, 2023. 
 Rivers lakes backlog at September 30, 2024 was 6.9 million, an increase of 0.1 million compared to rivers lakes backlog at December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to earn revenue on a project Arkansas which was in dredging backlog at December 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 The Company continues to actively manage its liquidity. The Company s principal sources of liquidity are net cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from previous issuances of long-term debt, and draws on our revolver. The Company s principal uses of cash are to meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, provide working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
 The Company s cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 83.6 million and 49.6 million, respectively. Normal increases or decreases in the level of working capital relative to the level of operational activity impact cash flow from operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relates primarily to significantly higher current period earnings in the current year, partially offset by the increases in contract revenues in excess of billings, decreases in billings in excess of contract revenues and changes in working capital compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 25 

The Company s cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 93.2 million and 97.0 million, respectively. Investing activities primarily relate to investments in our new build program, normal course upgrades and capital maintenance of the Company s dredging fleet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested 5.1 million in the Galveston Island , 29.1 million in the Amelia Island and 56.0 million in the Acadia , as well as maintenance capital expenditures . These investments were partially offset by the disposition of certain equipment for approximately 9.3 million during the current year. 
 The Company s cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled a use of 2.1 million and proceeds of 54.9 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities is primarily due to net borrowings under the Company s revolving debt facility and Second Lien Credit Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 10.0 million, compared to net borrowings of 55.0 million on the Company s revolving debt facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On April 24, 2024, the Credit Parties entered into a 150.0 million second lien credit agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Second Lien Credit Agreement with Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, on behalf of one or more clients, as the lender, and Guggenheim Credit Services, LLC as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Lead Arranger. The Company borrowed 100.0 under the Second Lien Credit Agreement on the closing date and has the option to borrow an additional 50.0 million for a period of 12 months following the closing date of the initial loan. The net proceeds from the Second Lien Credit Agreement were used to repay amounts outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement, to pay fees and expenses associated with the Second Lien Credit Agreement and ABL Amendment and for general corporate purposes, including to fund upcoming new build payments. Additionally, the deferred financing fees associated with the Second Lien Credit Agreement of approximately 10.9 million increased the net cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company expects to spend between approximately 130 million and 150 million on capital expenditures in 2024 which is comprised of vessels in our new build program and maintenance capital expenditures. The Company anticipates that remaining new build program payments will be made with cash on hand, future cash flows generated from operations, revolver availability, proceeds from the Second Lien Credit Agreement and potential new sources of financing. 
 Commitments, contingencies and liquidity matters 
 Refer to Note 5, Long-term debt, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Company s ABL Amendment, Second Lien Credit Agreement and 2029 Notes. Additionally, refer to Note 9, Commitments and contingencies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Company s surety agreements. 
 The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody s Investor Services changed our outlook from negative to stable and reaffirmed our corporate credit rating at B2. In the third quarter of 2024, S P Global Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating from CCC+ to B- and reaffirmed our outlook as stable. These credit ratings are below investment grade and could raise our cost of financing. As a consequence, we may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that we consider to be reasonable. One or more of these occurrences could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities. 
 The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents, its anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility and the option to borrow additional funds under the Second Lien Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund the Company s operations, capital expenditures and the scheduled debt service requirements for the next twelve months. Beyond the next twelve months, the Company s ability to fund its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and dividends, if any, and to comply with all the financial covenants under the ABL Amendment, Second Lien Credit Agreement and bonding agreements, depends on its future operating performance and cash flows, which in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company follows GAAP, which is described in Note 1, Basis of presentation, to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The application of these principles requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company, as well as the related footnote disclosures. The Company continually reviews its accounting policies and financial information disclosures. Except as noted in Note 1, Basis of presentation, of the Company s financial statements, there have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies or estimates since December 31, 2023.

The market risk profile of the Company on December 31, 2023 is disclosed in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. C ontrols and Procedures. 
 a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

 See Note 9, Commitments and contingencies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors. 
 Except as provided below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our business and operating results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies . 
 
 An unpredictable or volatile political environment in the United States, including any social unrest and uncertainty as a result of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to be adversely impacted. It is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that may result due to the upcoming presidential election. A new administration, or a change in the make-up of either the Senate and/or House of Representatives, may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. There is also no certainty that a new administration, or a change in the make-up of either the Senate and/or the House of Representatives, will maintain the level of federal spending and support for the dredging industry and offshore wind development. A significant reduction in such funding or support could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
