 warrants to United to purchase shares of the Company s Class A common stock. Each warrant provides United with the right to purchase share of the Company s Class A common stock at an exercise price of per share. The warrants were initially expected to vest in installments in accordance with the following milestones: the execution of the United Purchase Agreement and the United Collaboration Agreement, the completion of the Business Combination, the certification of the aircraft by the FAA, and the sale of aircraft to United. 
 On August 9, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the United Purchase Agreement (the Amended United Purchase Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the United Warrant Agreement (the Amended United Warrant Agreement ). In association with the Amended United Purchase Agreement, the Company received a million pre-delivery payment from United for of the Company s aircraft (the Pre-Delivery Payment ), which was recognized as a contract liability in other long-term liabilities in the Company s consolidated condensed balance sheets. Pursuant to the Amended United Warrant Agreement, the vesting condition of the fourth milestone of the United Warrant Agreement was modified, and the warrants now vest in installments in accordance with the following sub-milestones: (i) warrants vested upon receipt by the Company of the Pre-Delivery Payment on August 9, 2022; (ii) warrants vested on February 9, 2023 upon the anniversary of the amendment date; (iii) warrants shall vest upon the acceptance and delivery of each of the Company s aircraft; and (iv) warrants shall vest upon the acceptance and delivery of each of the Company s aircraft. 
 The Company accounts for the Amended United Purchase Agreement and the United Collaboration Agreement under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company identified the sale of each aircraft ordered by United as a separate performance obligation in the contract. As the performance obligations have not been satisfied, the Company has not recognized any revenue as of September 30, 2024. 
 With respect to the warrant vesting milestones outlined above, the Company accounts for them as consideration payable to a customer under ASC 606 related to the future purchase of aircraft by United. The Company determined that the warrants are classified as equity awards based on the criteria of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . Pursuant to ASC 718, the Company measured the grant date fair value of the warrants to be recognized upon the achievement of each of the original milestones and the vesting of the related warrants. 
 For the first milestone, issuance of the warrants in conjunction with the execution of the United Purchase Agreement and the United Collaboration Agreement, the Company recorded the grant date fair value of the respective warrant tranche at the vesting date upon satisfaction of the milestone, and the related costs were recorded in other warrant expense due to the absence of historical or probable future revenue. For the second milestone, the completion of the Business Combination transaction, the related costs were also recorded in other warrant expense due to the absence of historical or probable future revenue. For the third milestone, the certification of the aircraft by the FAA, the Company will assess whether it is probable that the award will vest at the end of every reporting period. If and when the award is deemed probable of vesting, the Company will begin capitalizing the grant date fair value of the associated warrants as an asset through the vesting date and subsequently amortize the asset as a reduction to revenue as it sells the new aircraft to United. 
 For the original fourth milestone, the sale of aircraft to United, the Company was initially expected to record the cost associated with the vesting of each portion of warrants within this milestone as a reduction of the transaction price as revenue is recognized for each sale of the aircraft. In connection with the Amended United Warrant Agreement, the Company evaluated the accounting implications associated with the amendment to the fourth milestone in accordance with ASC 606 and ASC 718. For the first sub-milestone, the receipt of the Pre-Delivery Payment, the Company accounted for it as a modification under ASC 718 and recorded the modification date fair value of the associated warrants in other warrant expense upon satisfaction of the sub-milestone on August 9, 2022. For the second sub-milestone, the vesting of warrants on February 9, 2023, the Company accounted for it as a modification under ASC 718 and recorded the modification date fair value of the associated warrants in other warrant expense on a straight-line basis over six months following the amendment date. The modification date fair value of each warrant associated with the first and second sub-milestones was determined to be , which was the stock price of the Company s Class A common stock at the modification date. For the third and fourth sub-milestones, the sale of aircraft and aircraft, respectively, the Company determined that the amendment does not represent a modification under ASC 718. The Company will record the cost associated with the vesting of each portion of the associated warrants as a reduction of the transaction price based on the original grant date fair value as revenue is recognized for each sale of the aircraft.

 million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized income tax provision of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company did t record any deferred income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes differed from the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign taxes currently payable. The Company realized no benefit for the current year losses due to a full valuation allowance against the United States and foreign net deferred tax assets. 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the analysis of federal and state deferred tax balances, future tax projections, and the Company s lack of taxable income in the carryback period, the Company did not believe it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, the Company had provided a full valuation allowance against the entire domestic and the majority of the foreign net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company intends to maintain the full valuation allowance against the United States net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance.

 public w arrants outstanding. Public warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares are issued upon exercise of the public warrants. The public warrants became exercisable on October 30, 2021, months after the closing of the initial public offering of Atlas , the predecessor of Archer. The public warrants will expire from the consummation of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 Once the public warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the public warrants for redemption: 
 in whole and not in part; 
 at a price of per public warrant; 
 upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 
 if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing after the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
 Each public warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase share of Class A common stock at a price of per share. The exercise price and number of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. The public warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the public warrants. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were private placement warrants outstanding. The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants underlying the shares sold in the initial public offering of Atlas, except that the private placement warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants became transferable, assignable, and salable on October 16, 2021, days after the completion of the Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the private placement warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the private placement

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated condensed financial statements and related accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 set forth in our Annual Report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. See the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report and those set forth in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Overview 
 We are designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing eVTOL aircraft for use in urban air mobility UAM networks. Our mission is to unlock the skies, freeing everyone to reimagine how they move and spend time. O ur eVTOL aircraft are designed to be safe, sustainable, and quiet. Our production aircraft, Midnight, which we unveiled in November of 2022, is designed around our proprietary 12-tilt-6 aircraft configuration. This means that it has 12 propellers attached to 6 booms on a fixed wing with all 12 propellers providing vertical lift during take-off and landing, and the forward 6 propellers tilting forward to cruise position to provide propulsion during forward flight with the wing providing aerodynamic lift like a conventional airplane. 
 Midnight is designed to carry 4 passengers plus a pilot optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20-miles, with minimal charging time between trips. We are working to certify Midnight with the Federal Aviation Administration FAA so that we can then enter into commercial service as soon as possible. In August 2023, we received the Special Airworthiness Certificate from the FAA for our first Midnight aircraft and began its flight testing program in October 2023. 
 Midnight is the evolution of our demonstrator eVTOL aircraft, Maker, which through its flight test program has helped validate our proprietary 12-tilt-6 aircraft configuration and certain key enabling technologies. The design of Midnight marries what we believe to be cutting-edge electric propulsion technology with state-of-the-art aircraft systems to deliver the key attributes of our eVTOL aircraft: 
 Safety. High redundancy and simplified propulsion systems make for a significantly safer aircraft compared to a helicopter. Midnight has no single critical point of failure, meaning that should any single component fail, the aircraft can still safely complete its flight. 
 Low noise. With its intended cruising altitude at approximately 2,000 feet, the design of Midnight is such that the noise that reaches the ground is expected to measure around 45 A-weighted decibels, approximately 100 times quieter than that of a helicopter. During forward flight, the aircraft s tilt propellers spin on axes that are aligned with the oncoming air flow, rather than edge-wise to the flow, as is the case with traditional helicopters - further decreasing noise levels. Since Archer s aircraft is spinning 12 small propellers rather than one large rotor, it can also spin them at significantly lower tip speeds, resulting in much lower noise levels. 
 Sustainable. Midnight is all electric, resulting in zero operating emissions. Archer is committed to sourcing renewable energy wherever possible to power its aircraft. Archer s design and engineering teams are working to integrate materials into this aircraft that have their own unique sustainability stories. 
 We continue to work to optimize our eVTOL aircraft design for both manufacturing and certification. The development of an eVTOL aircraft that meets our business requirements demands significant design and development efforts on all facets of the aircraft. We believe that by bringing together a mix of talent with eVTOL, traditional commercial aerospace, as well as electric propulsion backgrounds, we have built a team that enables us to move through the design, development, and certification of our eVTOL aircraft with the FAA in an efficient manner, thus allowing us to achieve our end goal of bringing to market our eVTOL aircraft as efficiently as possible. 
 
 Our Planned Lines of Business 
 Upon receipt of all necessary FAA certifications and any other government approvals necessary for us to manufacture and operate our aircraft, we intend to operate two complementary lines of business: Archer UAM and Archer Direct. 
 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Archer UAM 
 We plan to operate our own UAM ecosystem initially in select major cities. Our UAM ecosystem will operate using our eVTOL aircraft, which is currently in development. We project that the cost to manufacture and operate our eVTOL aircraft will be such that it will be able to enter the UAM ride-sharing market at a price point that is competitive with ground-based ride sharing services today. We will continue to evaluate our go-to-market strategy based on, among other things, estimated demand, readiness of the required infrastructure, and our ability to scale of our aircraft fleet. 
 Archer Direct 
 We also plan to selectively sell our aircraft to third parties and are continuing to develop our order pipeline. In 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement (as further amended, the United Purchase Agreement with United Airlines, Inc. United for the conditional purchase of up to 1.0 billion worth of aircraft, with an option for another 500.0 million worth of aircraft. 
 As we get closer to commercialization, we will look to determine the right mix of selling our aircraft versus using them as part of our UAM ecosystem based on, among other factors, our capital needs, our manufacturing volumes, our ability to ramp Archer UAM operations, and the purchase demand from our Archer Direct customers. 
 To date, we have not generated revenue from either of these planned categories, as we continue to design, develop, and seek the governmental approvals necessary for our eVTOL aircraft to enter into service. We will use our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future to continue to fund our efforts to bring our eVTOL aircraft to market. The amount and timing of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of the design and development of our aircraft and manufacturing operations, as well as our progress in obtaining necessary FAA certifications and other government approvals. For example, any significant delays in obtaining such FAA certifications and other government approvals will likely require us to raise additional capital above our existing cash on hand and delay our generation of revenues. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We are still working to design, develop, certify, and bring up manufacturing of our eVTOL aircraft and thus have not generated revenue from either of our planned lines of business. We do not expect to begin generating significant revenues until we are able to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing bring up of our eVTOL aircraft. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development activities represent a significant part of our business. Our research and development efforts focus on the design and development of our eVTOL aircraft, including certain of the systems that are used in it. As part of those activities, we continue to work closely with the FAA towards our goal of achieving certification of our eVTOL aircraft on an efficient timeline. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for employees focused on research and development activities, costs associated with developing and building prototype aircraft, associated facilities costs, and depreciation. We expect research and development expenses to increase significantly as we progress towards the certification and manufacturing of our eVTOL aircraft. 
 We cannot determine with certainty the timing, duration or the costs necessary to complete the design, development, certification, and manufacturing bring up of our eVTOL aircraft due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our research and development activities. Development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs may differ materially from expectations. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation) for employees associated with administrative services such as finance, legal, human resources, information technology, associated facilities costs, depreciation, and non-cash technology and dispute resolution agreements expense. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and consultants to support our operations and comply with applicable regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other SEC rules and regulations.

 Other Warrant Expense 
 Other warrant expense consists entirely of non-cash expense related to the vesting of warrants issued in conjunction with the execution of the United Purchase Agreement and the Warrant to Purchase Shares Agreement with United. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists of miscellaneous income and expense items, including the change in fair value of our warrant liabilities. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities, net of interest on notes payable.

 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 22.0 million, or 32.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as we invested in people and materials to advance our technology development. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 10.1 million in personnel-related expenses due to a significant increase in our workforce from the prior year period, an increase of 6.9 million in costs related to professional services and tools and materials to support our increased research and development activities, and an increase of 3.6 million in stock-based compensation expenses. The remainder of the increase was made up of other incidental items.

Table of Contents 

 Research and development expenses increased by 66.2 million, or 33.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we invested in people and materials to advance our technology development. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 31.3 million in personnel-related expenses due to a significant increase in our workforce from the prior year period, an increase of 19.0 million in costs related to professional services and tools and materials to support our increased research and development activities, and an increase of 13.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses. The remainder of the increase was made up of other incidental items. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 53.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense of 59.1 million associated with the forfeiture of the unvested portion of the Founder Grant issued to the Company s co-founder and former co-CEO, and an increase of 6.0 million in professional service expenses mainly due to legal fees and expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 13.9 million in stock-based compensation expenses. See Note 9 - Stock-Based Compensation to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details on our stock-based compensation. The remainder of the increase was made up of other incidental items. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 18.2 million, or 12.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 63.3 million in the charge for the Wisk Warrant, and a decrease of 11.2 million in professional service expenses mainly due to legal fees and expenses. The decrease was partially offset by a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense of 59.1 million associated with the forfeiture of the unvested portion of the Founder Grants issued to the Company s co-founder and former co-CEO. See Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 9 - Stock-Based Compensation to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details on our commitments and contingencies and stock-based compensation, respectively. The remainder of the decrease was made up of other incidental items. 
 Other Warrant Expense 
 There was no other warrant expense recognized for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Other warrant expense decreased by 2.1 million, or 100.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the vesting of United warrants associated with specific milestones during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The warrants associated with the specific milestones fully vested in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 9 - Stock-Based Compensation to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details on our warrants. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased by 11.8 million and 51.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to changes in fair value of our warrant liabilities. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net increased by 0.4 million, or 7.8 , and 5.1 million, or 47.2 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to interest income from our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 501.7 million. We have incurred net losses since our inception and to date have not generated any revenues. We expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements. 
 On October 5, 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Synovus Bank, as administrative agent and lender, and the additional lenders (the Lenders from time to time. We may request the Lenders to provide multiple delayed term loan advances (together, the Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 65.0 million for the construction and development

 of our manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. The Loan under the Credit Agreement shall accrue interest from and including the date the applicable advance is made but excluding the repayment date at a rate of the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus 2.0 subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 . We are required to make interest-only payments for 36 months on the Loan starting on November 14, 2023, followed by monthly interest and principal payments for the remaining maturity, with any outstanding principal, interest and other then outstanding indebtedness due at maturity. The Credit Agreement matures on the earlier of October 5, 2033 or the date on which the outstanding Loan has been declared or automatically becomes due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by our current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by cash, general intangibles, instruments, securities, financial assets, security entitlements and other property maintained in a money market account at Synovus Bank. 
 In November 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC and a related prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate value of up to 70.0 million pursuant to a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor ), as the sales agent (the First ATM Program ). The First ATM Program was fully utilized in May 2024. We did not sell any shares of Class A common stock under the First ATM Program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 10,275,033 shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds of 48.1 million. 
 In May 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that permits the offering of an aggregate of up to 95.0 million of shares of our Class A common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement ), including a prospectus for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate value of up to 70.0 million (the Second ATM Program ). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 4,420,400 and 12,188,300 shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds of 13.7 million and 38.6 million, respectively, under the Second ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 30.1 million remaining eligible for sale under the Second ATM Program. 
 We pay Cantor a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from any shares of Class A common stock sold through the Sales Agreement. 
 On June 27, 2024, pursuant to the forward purchase agreement (the Stellantis Forward Purchase Agreement entered into on January 3, 2023 with Stellantis N.V. Stellantis ), we elected to draw down the 55.0 million remaining available under the Stellantis Forward Purchase Agreement associated with Milestone 3 (as defined in the Stellantis Forward Purchase Agreement). In accordance therewith, on July 1, 2024, we issued 17,401,153 shares of Class A common stock to Stellantis for gross proceeds of approximately 55.0 million. 
 On August 8, 2024, we entered into subscription agreements with certain investors providing for the private placement of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of 3.35 per share (the PIPE Financing ). A portion of the PIPE Financing closed on August 12, 2024 for 49,283,582 shares of our Class A common stock for net proceeds of approximately 158.0 million, after deducting offering costs. The remaining portion of the PIPE Financing covering an aggregate of 2,982,089 shares of our Class A common stock to be issued and sold to Stellantis for gross proceeds of approximately 10.0 million is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders. 
 In the long term, our ability to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the level of research and development expenses we incur as we continue to develop our eVTOL aircraft; 
 capital expenditures needed to bring up our aircraft manufacturing capabilities, including for both the build out of our manufacturing facilities and component purchases necessary to build our aircraft; 
 general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations; and 
 sales, marketing and distribution expenses as we build, brand and market our eVTOL aircraft and UAM network. 
 Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from our business operations, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through existing cash on hand, pre-delivery payments, equity financing and debt financing.

 Notes Payable 
 See Note 6 - Notes Payable to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details on our debt. 
 Leases 
 We lease office, lab, hangar, and storage facilities in the normal course of business. Under our operating leases as noted in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated condensed financial statements, we have current obligations of 5.9 million and long-term obligations of 15.1 million. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): 
 Operating activities (264.2) (187.6) Investing activities (57.8) 429.7 Financing activities 358.9 154.3 
 Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 
 We continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we are still working to design, develop, certify, and bring up manufacturing of our eVTOL aircraft and thus have not generated any revenues from either of our planned lines of business. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our research and development activities related to our eVTOL aircraft, as well as the general and administrative functions necessary to support those activities and operations as a publicly traded company. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by the working capital requirements to support growth and fluctuations in personnel-related expenditures, accounts payable, accrued interest and other current liabilities, and other current assets. 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 264.2 million, resulting from a net loss of 338.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items consisting primarily of 84.9 million in stock-based compensation, a gain of 30.3 million due to a change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, 8.2 million in depreciation, amortization and other, 6.1 million of research and development warrant expenses related to the warrants issued to Stellantis (see Note 9 - Stock-Based Compensation to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details), and a 5.6 million non-cash charge for the Wisk Warrant. The net cash provided by changes in our net operating assets and liabilities was 0.9 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 187.6 million, resulting from a net loss of 348.8 million, adjusted for non-cash items consisting primarily of a 75.3 million non-cash charge comprised of a 26.3 million non-cash charge associated with the initial vested share tranche and a 49.0 million non-cash charge for the unvested portion of the Wisk Warrant, relating to the Technology and Dispute Resolution Agreements (see Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details), a loss of 25.8 million due to a change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, 24.8 million in stock-based compensation which includes the reversal of 59.1 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the forfeiture of one of the Founder Grants, and 13.1 million of research and development warrant expenses related to the warrants issued to Stellantis (see Note 9 - Stock-Based Compensation to our consolidated condensed financial statements for further details). The net cash provided by changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of 18.2 million was primarily related to a 10.3 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments and a 5.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses, primarily due to the release of payments from the receipt of goods and services during the period. 
 Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 57.8 million, driven by purchases of property and equipment within the period.

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 429.7 million, driven by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of 465.0 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of 35.3 million within the period. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 358.9 million, driven by gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing of 165.1 million, proceeds from shares issued under the First ATM Program and Second ATM Program of 87.0 million, proceeds from issuance of debt of 57.5 million, proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock to Stellantis with an aggregate value of 55.0 million, partially offset by payments of offering costs in connection with the PIPE Financing for 7.1 million . 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 154.3 million, driven by gross proceeds from the PIPE financing of 145.0 million, proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock to Stellantis with an aggregate value of 25.0 million, partially offset by the repayment of term loans to Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank, for 7.5 million and payments of offering costs in connection with the PIPE financing for 6.0 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes in our policies from those previously discussed in our Annual Report. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated condensed financial statements for a discussion about accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued and not yet adopted. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments, which subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents are held at several long-standing financial institutions located in the United States. At times, cash account balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits 250 thousand per depositor per institution). We have not experienced any losses due to these excess deposits and believe this risk is not significant. Our short-term investments consisted of high quality, investment grade marketable securities and were held at a major financial institution located in the United States. We have established guidelines regarding diversification of our investments and their maturities that are designed to preserve principal and achieve liquidity requirements. We review these guidelines and modify them as necessary based on updated liquidity needs and changes in our operations and financial position. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates applicable to our borrowings and investments in money market funds. The Loan under the Credit Agreement accrues interest from and including the date the applicable advance is made but excluding the repayment date at the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus 2.0 subject to a SOFR floor of 0.0 . Additionally, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaling 508.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and achieve liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 100

 basis point change in interest rates applicable to the Loan under the Credit Agreement or with respect to our investment portfolio would not have a material impact on the fair value of our borrowings and investment portfolio for the periods presented and our future interest income and expense. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognizes that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all possible instances of errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. From time to time, we may bring or be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, it may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our securities involves risks. The following risk factors supplement and, to the extent inconsistent, supersede the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report. Risk factors describing the major risks to our business can be found under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described therein, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report, including Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Unless otherwise indicated, references in these risk factors to our business being harmed will include harm to our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In any such event, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 The dual-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with certain shareholders of our Class B common stock, which could limit other shareholders ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. 
 Shares of our Class B common stock have ten votes per share, while shares of our Class A common stock have one vote per share. Our founders, as well as certain other stockholders, hold the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. These shares currently represent a majority of the voting power of our capital stock on an outstanding basis. For so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1 of all outstanding shares of our capital stock and if voted together, the holders of our Class B common stock would be able to control matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. The holders of our Class B common stock may have interests that differ from other shareholders and may vote in a way which may be adverse to other shareholders or with which our other shareholders may disagree. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control, could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Since the shares of our Class B common stock represented less than 10.0 of all outstanding shares of our common stock during the year ending December 31, 2024, pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we anticipate each outstanding share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into Class A common stock on December 31, 2024. This conversion will result in immediately diluting the voting interests of the holders who previously held Class B common stock. 
 The final terms of our proposed contract manufacturing relationship with Stellantis and its affiliates remain uncertain and are subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation. 
 We entered into a memorandum of understanding, effective November 1, 2024, with FCA USA LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stellantis N.V. Stellantis containing additional detail regarding the terms of the planned contract manufacturing relationship with Stellantis that we previously announced on August 8, 2024. Although the memorandum of understanding requires us and FCA USA LLC to use reasonable best efforts to finalize and execute the contract manufacturing agreement governing the contracting manufacturing relationship by November 30, 2024, there is no assurance that we will execute the contract manufacturing agreement on that timeline or at all.
