The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

There were securities in an unrealized loss position in the less than 12 months category and securities in the 12 months or more category at June 30, 2024. Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity are backed by pools of mortgages that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Home Mortgage Corporation. It is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses has been recorded. at September 30, 2024 and as of June 30, 2024, from the amortized cost basis of loans.

Table of Contents) Provision for unfunded commitments Total provision for (recovery of) credit losses ) Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis typically includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as commercial and industrial, commercial real estate loans and multi-family real estate loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass Loans classified as pass represent loans that are evaluated and are performing under the stated terms. Pass rated assets are analyzed by the paying capacity, the current net worth, and the value of the loan collateral of the obligor. Watch - A watch grade is assigned to any credit that is adequately secured and performing but monitored for a number of indicators. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to: any unexpected short-term adverse financial performance from budgeted projections or prior period results (i.e., declining profits, sales, margins, cash flow, or increased reliance on leverage, including adverse balance sheet ratios, trade debt issues, etc.), any managerial or personal problems of company management, a decline in the entire industry or local economic conditions, failure to provide financial information or other documentation as requested, issues regarding delinquency, overdrafts, or renewals, and any other issues that cause concern for the company. Special Mention The characteristics of a special mention asset have potential weaknesses that deserve the Company s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are considered criticized assets. Characteristics of special mention loans may include: continued adverse financial trends relating to declining sales, profits, margins, balance sheet ratios, increasing debt to worth, and trade debt issues; cash flows declining in coverage, a repeated lack of compliance with Bank requests for information, correction of a violation of loan covenants, lack of current or adequate financial information or documentation, or more serious managerial or declining industry conditions. Weakness identified in a special mention credit should be short-term in nature. Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth, paying capacity of the obligor, or by the collateral pledged. Substandard loans must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt as originally contracted. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have the weaknesses of those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans in this category are individually evaluated for impairment or charged-off if deemed uncollectible. Residential real estate and consumer loans are managed on a pool basis due to their homogeneous nature. Loans that are 90 days or more delinquent or are not accruing interest are considered nonperforming.

The decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of a change in Wisconsin tax law that provides for a subtraction from the Bank s state taxable income for loan and fee interest income from certain commercial and agricultural loans. Based upon the provisions of this new state tax law, management determined that the Company was highly unlikely to incur a material Wisconsin tax liability in the foreseeable future, instead generating Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards that would never be realized. Since the state rate at which net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized is , the Company eliminated its state net deferred tax asset balances as of July 1, 2023, resulting in deferred tax expense of

As of September 30, 2024, there were stock option awards available for future awards under this plan. The aggregate intrinsic value of a stock option represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options prior to the expiration date. The intrinsic value can change based on fluctuations in the market value of the Company s stock.

At September 30, 2024, future compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock outstanding was which will be amortized over a remaining period of years. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of restricted stock available for issuance. A summary of restricted stock activity and related information for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is as follows: Granted Exercised Forfeited Outstanding, September 30, 2024 Unused commitments under lines of credit MPF credit enhancements Commitments to grant loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) credit enhancements allow the Company to share the credit risk associated with home mortgage finance with Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). MPF provides the Company the ability to originate, sell, and service fixed-rate, residential mortgage loans, and receive a Credit Enhancement Fee based on the performance of the loans. FHLB manages the liquidity, interest rate, and prepayment risks of the loans while the Company manages the credit risk of the loans. The Company will incur an obligation on a foreclosure loss only after a foreclosure loss exceeds the borrower s equity, any private mortgage insurance, and the funded first loss account. Based on the delinquency results for states where properties are located and the Company s historical loss experience, the estimated foreclosure losses are immaterial. The Company, from time to time, may be a defendant in legal proceedings relating to the conduct of its banking business. Most of such legal proceedings are a normal part of the banking business and, in management s opinion as of September 30, 2024, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company would not be materially affected by the outcome of such legal proceedings.

Financial Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting guidance requires disclosures of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair values. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the scope of the guidance. The estimated fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Federal funds sold Interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions Available for sale debt securities Held to maturity debt securities Loans, net Investment in restricted stock Interest receivable Financial Liabilities Deposits Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances Accrued interest payable The methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis have been previously disclosed. A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below: Cash and due from banks Due to their short -term nature, the carrying amount of cash and due from banks approximates fair value and is categorized in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Federal funds sold Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of federal funds sold approximates the fair value and is categorized in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions- Due to their short -term nature, the carrying amount of interest- bearing deposits in other financial institutions approximates fair value and is categorized in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Available for sale securities For those available for sale debt securities where quoted prices are unavailable, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities and, therefore, are classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. For those available for sale debt securities where market prices of similar securities are not available because of the lack of observable market data, they are valued on a quarterly basis by a third-party valuation expert and, therefore, are classified as level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Held to maturity debt securities -The fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or by pricing models and is categorized as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Loans The fair value of variable rate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying values. The fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to

 Overview Net Interest Income. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses. We charge (credit) provisions for (recovery of) credit losses to operations in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded commitments at a level that is considered reasonable and necessary to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and expected losses on commitments to grant loans that are expected to be advanced at the consolidated balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and the levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for (recovery of) credit losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for credit losses in order to maintain the allowance. Non-interest Income. Our primary sources of non-interest income are mortgage banking income, service charges on deposit accounts and net gains in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance. Other sources of non-interest income sometimes include net gain or losses on sales and calls of securities, net gain or loss on disposal of foreclosed assets and other income. Non-Interest Expenses. Our non-interest expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment, data processing and office, professional fees, marketing expenses, foreclosed assets and other general and administrative expenses, including premium payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposits. Provision for Income Taxes. Our income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. In 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. The following represent our significant accounting policies and estimates: Allowance for Credit Losses . We establish the allowance for credit losses through charges (credits) to earnings in the form of a provision for (recovery of) credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses

 for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses ACL at September 30, 2024 represents the Company s current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan portfolio. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans expected remaining term. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. In addition, management s estimate of expected credit losses is based on the discounted cash flows over the remaining life of loans held for investment, and changes in expected prepayment behavior may result in changes in the remaining life of loans and expected credit losses. The allowance may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; (2) changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; (3) nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; (4) volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as loan modifications; (5) existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; (6) experience, ability, and depth of lending department management and other relevant staff; (7) quality of loan review and board of directors oversight; (8) the effect of other external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements; and (9) changes in national and local economic conditions related to unemployment, house price index, and gross domestic product. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. The level of the allowance is particularly sensitive to changes in the actual and forecasted probability of default of benchmarked banks and changes in current conditions or reasonably expected future conditions affecting the collectability of loans. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the WDFI, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. Provision for Income Taxes . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the tax effects from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized, upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties accrued or released related to uncertain tax positions in current income tax expense or benefit.

 Debt Securities. For available-for-sale and held to maturity debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through a provision for credit losses. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Foreclosed Assets . Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 Total Assets. Total assets decreased 2.8 million, or 1.3 , to 216.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 219.2 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net loans of 7.3 million, or 4.0 , which was offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 4.5 million, or 43.4 . The remaining asset categories showed no significant changes when comparing September 30, 2024 with June 30, 2024. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents increased 4.5 million, or 43.4 , to 15.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.5 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in net loans of 7.3 million which was offset by a decrease in borrowings of 3.0 million. Debt Securities Available for Sale. Total debt securities available for sale remained substantially unchanged at 6.6 million when comparing September 30, 2024 with June 30, 2024. Loans. Gross loans decreased 7.5 million, or 4.0 , to 177.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 185.3 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was due to a decrease in all categories of loans. Commercial real estate loans decreased by 4.0 million or 5.3 . Multi-family real estate loans decreased by 1.4 million or 3.1 . Construction loans decreased by 1.3 million to no construction loans being held at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million being held at June 30, 2024. The decrease in construction loans was primarily due to all construction loans being converted to permanent financings. The remaining categories of loan decreases (commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, commercial and industrial and one-to-four-family residential loans) were primarily due to repayments exceeding new loan growth.

Total deposits decreased slightly by 815,000, or 0.5 , to 172.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 173.0 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits was related to customers who changed banks to obtain higher rates and the Bank being less aggressive in matching competitor interest rates. There was also a shift from non-interest bearing deposits to interest bearing deposits of approximately 2.0 million as customers moved their deposits to higher rate products at the Bank. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Advances. FHLB advances decreased 3.0 million to 10.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 13.0 million in FHLB advances at June 30, 2024 as the Bank paid down a term borrowing of 3.0 million that matured in August 2024. Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity increased by 292,000 when comparing September 30, 2024 with June 30, 2024 due to net income of 175,000 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 112,000 resulting from an increase in the fair market value of the debt securities available for sale portfolio due to favorable changes in market interest rates.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the provision for (recovery of) credit losses from a provision for credit losses of 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a recovery of credit losses of 155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The provision for income taxes also decreased by 161,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in net interest income of 143,000, a decrease in non-interest income of 35,000 and an increase in non-interest expenses of 90,000. Interest Income . Interest income decreased by 93,000, or 3.9 , to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in loan interest income of 105,000 offset by an increase in other interest income of 23,000. Income from debt securities decreased slightly by 12,000. Loan interest income decreased by 105,000, or 4.8 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio of 17.4 million, or 8.8 , which was offset by an increase in the average yield on loans of 20 basis points. The average balance of the loan portfolio decreased by 17.4 million, or 8.8 , to 179.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 197.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the average balance of the loan portfolio was primarily related to repayments exceeding new loan growth. The average yield on the loan portfolio increased by 20 basis points from 4.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of higher interest rates. Debt securities interest income decreased by 12,000, or 20.7 , to 46,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 58,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 2.2 million in

Table of Contents 
 the average balance of debt securities to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Offsetting the decrease in average balance, was a ten basis points increase in the average yield on the debt securities portfolio to 2.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the higher interest rate environment. The average balance of debt securities continued to decrease as a result of securities paydowns. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 50,000, or 6.0 , to 892,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 842,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase of 42,000 in interest paid on borrowings and an increase of 9,000 in interest paid on deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased 9,000, or 1.1 , to 771,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 763,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in the average rate paid on all deposit categories, offset by a decrease in the average balances of all deposit categories. The average rate paid on deposits increased by 27 basis points to 2.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average rate paid on all deposit categories was due to higher interest rates. All categories of deposit average balances decreased when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 with the three months ended September 30, 2023 with the average balance of deposits decreasing by 21.2 million, or 12.2 , to 152.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the average balances of all deposits was related to customers who changed banks to obtain higher rates and the Bank being less aggressive in matching competitor interest rates. In addition, we had a 4.2 million brokered certificate of deposit that matured in March 2024. Interest paid on FHLB borrowings increased 42,000, from 79,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 121,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest paid on borrowings was due to the average balance of FHLB advances increasing by 1.9 million to 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in the average rate paid on borrowings of 94 basis points from 3.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in borrowing costs. Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by 143,000, or 9.2 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest-earning assets decreased by 735,000, or 2.0 , to 36.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest rate spread decreased by eight basis points to 2.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.57 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 34 basis points increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities which was offset by a 26 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin remained unchanged at 2.85 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on interest earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the average yield of all interest-earning asset categories related to the increase in market interest rates over the past year. The increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was due to the Bank raising the interest rates on all deposit categories to maintain customers and keep the rates in line with what the competitors were offering. Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses. We charge (credit) provisions for (recovery of) credit losses to operations in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded commitments at a level that is considered reasonable and necessary to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and expected losses on commitments to grant loans that are expected to be advanced at the consolidated balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and the levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for (recovery of) credit losses in order to maintain the allowance. Based on our evaluation of the above factors, we recorded a recovery of credit losses of 155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery was related to the projected future economic conditions in our market area stabilizing over the next two years and a 7.5 million decline in the loan portfolio due primarily to repayments in the commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios. These predictions align with the Bank s historic charge-off history over the past 8-10 years. The allowance for credit losses was 1.6 million, or 0.92 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2.0 million, or 1.01 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2023. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded our best estimate of expected losses in the loan portfolio and for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for credit losses. In addition, the WDFI and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. Non-interest Income. Non-interest income information is as follows.

Non-interest Expenses. Non-interest expenses information is as follows.

Table of Contents 
 Non-interest expenses were 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to an increase in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses related to the new branch which opened in January 2024. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 160,000, as compared to income tax expense of 201,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of a change in Wisconsin tax law that provides for a subtraction from the Bank s state taxable income for loan and fee interest income from certain commercial and agricultural loans. Based upon the provisions of this new state tax law, management determined that the Company was highly unlikely to incur a material Wisconsin tax liability in the foreseeable future, instead generating Wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards that would never be realized. Since the state rate at which net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized is 0 , the Company eliminated its state net deferred tax asset balances as of July 1, 2023, resulting in deferred tax expense of approximately 112,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Asset Quality Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Delinquent Loans . The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies, including non-accrual loans, by type and amount at the dates indicated.

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company foreclosed on collateral supporting a construction loan which was valued at 2.3 million and was included in foreclosed assets, net. The valuation was based on independent appraisals subject to certain discounts less estimated costs to sell. A subsequent independent appraisal was obtained in April 2024 resulting in a new valuation of 2.1 million subject to certain discounts less estimated costs to sell. After adjusting for estimated costs to sell, the revised valuation was 1.4 million resulting in a provision for valuation allowance of 937,100 being recorded during the year ended June 30, 2024. Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of an allowance for credit loss is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention or Watch by our management. There were no loans classified as substandard, doubtful or loss in the Company s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Credit Losses . We establish the allowance for credit losses through charges (credits) to earnings in the form of a provision for (recovery of) credit losses. Credit losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses ACL at September 30, 2024 represents the Company s current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan portfolio. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans expected remaining term. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. In addition, management s estimate of expected credit losses is based on the discounted cash flows over the remaining life of loans held for investment, and changes in expected prepayment behavior may result in changes in the remaining life of loans and expected credit losses. The allowance may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; (2) changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; (3) nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; (4) volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as loan modifications; (5) existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; (6) experience, ability, and depth of lending department management and other relevant staff; (7) quality of loan review and board of directors oversight; (8) the effect of other external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements; and (9) changes in national and local economic conditions related to unemployment, house price index, and gross domestic product. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. The level of the allowance is particularly sensitive to changes in the actual and forecasted probability of default of benchmarked banks and changes in current conditions or reasonably expected future conditions affecting the collectability of loans. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the WDFI, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.

 Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses allocated by loan category and the percent of the allowance in each category to the total allocated allowance at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At September 30, 2024, we had a 77.3 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which had 10.0 million in borrowings outstanding as of that date. The Bank also has 25.0 million available to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank when pledging acceptable assets and an unsecured Federal Funds purchasing limit of 5.0 million with the Bank s correspondent bank. At September 30, 2024, the Bank did not borrow any additional funds from the Federal Reserve or from the correspondent bank. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 945,000 and 367,000 of cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan origination, the purchase of securities, and the purchase of premises and equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was 7.5 million provided by investing activities compared to 1.5 million used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and borrowings, was 3.9 million used in financing activities compared to 3.6 million being used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience, current pricing strategy and regulatory restrictions, we anticipate that a substantial portion of maturing time deposits will be retained, and that we can supplement our funding with borrowings in the event that we allow these deposits to run off at maturity. At September 30, 2024, Marathon Bank was classified as well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes. See Note 11-Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 4.6 million, and 385,000 in outstanding commitments to sell loans. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from September 30, 2024 totaled 46.3 million, which include 4.4 million in brokered certificates of deposit. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances or other borrowings, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Impact of Inflation and Changing Price The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must necessarily reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgement in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer , the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024.
