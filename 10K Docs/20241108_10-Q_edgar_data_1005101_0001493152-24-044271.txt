that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events,
and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances
could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

In
re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation 

On
June 19, 2020, USCF LLC, USO, and USCF LLC executive officers, John P. Love, and Stuart P. Crumbaugh, were named as defendants in a
putative class action filed by purported shareholder Robert Lucas (the Lucas Class Action ). The Court thereafter
consolidated the Lucas Class Action with two related putative class actions filed on July 31, 2020 and August 13, 2020, and
appointed a lead plaintiff. The consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York under the caption In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation , Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-04740. 

On
November 30, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the Amended Lucas Class Complaint ). The Amended
Lucas Class Complaint asserts claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended Securities Exchange Act ), and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint
challenges statements in registration statements that became effective on February 25, 2020 and March 23, 2020 as well as subsequent
public statements through April 2020 concerning certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the
demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Amended
Lucas Class Complaint purports to have been brought by an investor in USO on behalf of a class of similarly-situated shareholders
who purchased USO securities between February 25, 2020 and April 28, 2020 and pursuant to the challenged registration statements.
The Amended Lucas Class Complaint seeks to certify a class and to award the class compensatory damages at an amount to be determined
at trial as well as costs and attorney s fees. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint named as defendants USCF, USO, USCF executive
officers John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, and USCF LLC directors Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M.
Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes III, as well as the marketing agent, ALPS Distributors, Inc., and the Authorized
Participants: ABN Amro, BNP Paribas Securities Corporation, Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse
Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Company, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch
Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC,
SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC. 

The
lead plaintiff has filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of its claims against BNP Paribas Securities Corporation, Citadel Securities
LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Company, Inc.,
Nomura Securities International, Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, and UBS Securities LLC. 

USCF
LLC, USO, and the individual defendants in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation intend to vigorously contest
such claims and have moved for their dismissal. 

Mehan
Action 

On
August 10, 2020, purported shareholder Darshan Mehan filed a derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against
defendants USCF LLC executive officers John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, and USCF LLC directors
Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes, III (the Mehan Action ). The action is
pending in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda as Case No. RG20070732. 

The
Mehan Action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to USO and failed to act in good faith in connection with a
March 19, 2020 registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand
for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks,
on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan
Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation. 

USCF
LLC, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest such claims. 

In
re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation 

On
August 27, 2020, purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc. DBA Golden International filed two separate derivative
actions on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF LLC executive officers John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Andrew
F Ngim, Nicholas D. Gerber, and USCF LLC directors, Robert L. Nguyen, Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes, III, and Peter M. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action No.
1:20-cv-06974 (the Cantrell Action and Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06981 (the AML Action ),
respectively. 

The
complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 21D of the
Securities Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of
control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO s disclosures and
defendants alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in 2020 that caused demand for oil to fall
precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of
USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML
Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action. 

The
Court consolidated the Cantrell and AML Actions under the caption In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation , Civil
Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 and appointed co-lead counsel. All proceedings in In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation
 are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation . 

USCF
LLC, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest the claims in In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative
Litigation .

Quarter
Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue
decreased by 0.3 million or 4 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 driven by a decrease in average Assets Under Management AUM in our fund management business. Average AUM for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 billion compared
to 3.5 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in AUM in quarter ended September 30, 2024 was due to commodity price fluctuations and the high-interest rate environment, along
with geopolitical and economic uncertainty. 

Gross
profit decreased by 0.4 million or 7 for the reasons described above for the reduced revenue plus cost of revenue increased by 0.1
million compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating
expenses increased by 0.7 million or 10 as a result of the following. General and administrative expenses increased by 0.3
million or 14 driven by increased costs associated with our Fintech app development including additional software and security
infrastructure in the UK. Salaries and compensation increased by 0.6 million or 22 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 driven
by increased stock-based compensation expenses plus increased compensation at USCF. Fund operations increased by 0.1 million or 11 
driven by increased costs associated with managing more funds. Partially offsetting these increased operating expenses was a
decrease in marketing and advertising of 0.3 million or 31 as a result of prior year increased spending for new products at
Original Sprout as well as from the Fintech app and new fund launches. 

Other
income, net, decreased by 0.1 million or 57 driven by a decrease in gains on investments during the quarter ended September 30, 2024
compared to prior year quarter. 

Benefit
from income taxes increased by 0.2 million or 59 driven by the increase in the loss before income taxes for the reasons explained above. 

Net
loss increased by 1.1 million or 217 and was driven by decreased profits from our fund management business due to lower average
AUM and higher stock-based compensation charges.

Segments 

Quarter
Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 

Fund
Management Related Party - USCF Investments 

USCF
Investments earns monthly management and advisory fees based on agreements with each Fund as determined by the contractual basis
point management fee structure in each agreement multiplied by the average AUM over the given period. Average AUM for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 billion compared to 3.5 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As a result of lower
AUM for the current quarter when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, revenue decreased by 0.5 million or 9 . The
decrease in AUM in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was due to commodity price fluctuations and the high-interest rate environment, along
with geopolitical and economic uncertainty. 

Operating
income decreased by 0.8 million or 45 driven by the decrease in average AUM as described above and increased fund operations
expenses of 0.1 million or 11 as a result of increased license fees, fund accounting and administration costs connected to new
fund launches as well as increases in compensation expense of 0.1 million or 15 . 

Food
Products - Gourmet Foods 

Gourmet Foods has two distinct operating divisions: 1) a commercial-scale bakery producing iconic Kiwi pies and sausage rolls and 2) a
digital printing establishment (Printstock Products Limited) who prints specialty food wrappers. Total food products revenue increased
by 0.1 million or 5 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023, which was the net result of an increase at our printing
business and a decrease at our bakery business. 

Operating (loss) income was nearly break-even for both quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
which was driven by a
non-recurring cost of goods sold adjustment coupled with a depreciation charge taken for our solar electricity system and partially offset by increased profits from the sale of higher margin products at our bakery business. 

Beauty
Products Original Sprout 

Original
Sprout derives revenues through the sale of proprietary hair and skin care products marketed to domestic and international distributors,
grocery stores, hair salons and direct-to-consumers via online platforms. Revenue decreased by 0.2 million or 23 driven by the efforts
to control the discounted price of products sold online by authorized resellers. This trend is expected to continue for the remainder of
the current fiscal year as Original Sprout reduces the number of authorized Internet sales channels and repositions its products for
a larger presence on store shelves. 

Operating
loss decreased by 0.1 million or 46 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 as a result of reduced marketing cost
and a nominal price increase to domestic distributors. 

Security
Systems - Brigadier 

Brigadier
earns revenue from recurring alarm monitoring fees charged to residential customers, and from hardware sales and installations of
access controls to commercial customers. Revenues from monitoring residual fees remained relatively static while sales and
installations of larger commercial installations increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. Revenue
increased by 0.1 million or 25 and operating income increased by 0.1 million or 87 driven by increased sales to commercial
customers. The larger commercial accounts generate more revenue and profits but take longer to complete, thus may produce spikes
or declines in revenue and profits for specific reporting periods. As the residential consumer segment of the industry becomes more complex
due to the bundling of services, including alarm monitoring, offered by larger telecom companies, we expect to focus even more heavily
on the commercial and public facilities customers in the coming years. 

Financial
Services Marygold US and Marygold UK 

Our Financial Services
segment is comprised of Marygold US and Marygold UK, which are distinct operating entities with differing revenue streams. 

Marygold US has developed
and recently launched a mobile banking fintech app which earns revenues in the form of management fees based on a percentage of the amount
of account holder funds are invested in various curated ETF portfolios offered on the app Money Pools ), and from transaction
fees when account holders use our debit card. The app was soft-launched in June 2023 and since that time has earned only de minimis revenues.
Operating costs are comprised of development team salaries and expenses, fees paid to third party vendors, fees paid to our sponsoring
bank, marketing costs and staff salaries. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Marygold US incurred an operating loss of 1.4 million
as compared with an operating loss of 1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. These losses and negative cash flows are
expected to continue for the coming fiscal year. 

Marygold UK is a holding
company in the U.K. which operates through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries Tiger Financial and Asset Management and Steb By Step Financial
Planners, both of whom are registered investment advisors who earn revenues based on the amount of assets under management or from the
sale of financial products, such as insurance, to customers in the U.K. 

Our total Financial Services
revenue, which was derived entirely from Marygold UK, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.1 million or 65 to 0.2
million as compared to 0.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the incremental revenue
of 0.1 million from Step-By-Step, which was acquired in April 2024. Operating loss increased by less than 0.1 million or 4 due to
increased costs incurred in connection with the adoption and implementation of the Marygold mobile Fintech app for the U.K. market. The
consolidated operating loss for financial services was 1.6 million for the current quarter as compared to a loss of 1.5 million for
the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

21 

Corporate
Headquarters 

The
parent company has no significant revenue, however it does have operating expenses such as, but not limited to, salaries, audit and legal
fees, NYSE listing expenses, shareholder reports, insurance, interest expense, and investor relations which produce operating losses.
Operating loss for the corporate headquarters increased by 0.5 million, or 49 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to same period in 2023. The increased loss was driven by higher stock-based compensation expenses from a large equity grant awarded in
the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Marygold Companies is a holding company that conducts its individual business operations through its subsidiaries. At the holding-company
level, its liquidity needs relate to operational expenses, the funding of additional business acquisitions and new investment opportunities.
Our operating subsidiaries principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, debt service, and capital
expenditures, including purchases of equipment and services, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. Cash is managed at the holding
company and the subsidiary level. There are generally no legal limitations or constraints on the movement of funds between the entities,
however there are potential tax consequences for funds moved from foreign subsidiaries to the parent company. Additionally, registered
investment advisor subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum capital requirements. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 6.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis as compared to 5.5 million as of
June 30, 2024, an increase of 1.2 million or 22 . Our cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024
was 0.9 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company made additional expenditures of 1.5 million with regard to
the development of our mobile Fintech app. We have invested a total of 16.5 million in the Fintech app since Marygold s
inception. In September 2024, we entered into a new financing arrangement under which we borrowed 4.4 million and have the
potential to borrow an additional 2.2 million. The new financing arrangement also gives the lender the right but not the obligation
to provide an additional 10.0 million in financing to us on the same terms as the initial loans. We expect that we will require
additional financing to fund our fintech operations over the coming 12
months. As the funding requirements become known, we will decide upon the source of the additional capital. Despite these cash investments and expenses, our working capital position remains strong at 17.1 million as of
September 30, 2024. 

Based
on our current operating plan which includes continued significant investments in the mobile Fintech app, we intend to raise additional
capital through one or more debt and/or equity financing to meet our operating and cash needs. There can be no assurance we will be able
to raise additional financing upon terms acceptable to us. In the event we are unable to obtain additional financing in an amount or upon terms
 acceptable to us, we expect to reduce or curtail our investment in the development of our Fintech app. 

22 

Lease
Liability 

The
Company has various leases for offices, warehouses and manufacturing facilities. The total amount due under these obligations was
 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company renewed leases in New Zealand and
the US which increased the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by 0.7 million. The obligations will reduce over the passage
of time through periodic lease payments. See Note 10 for further analysis of this obligation. 

Recent
Note Financing 

On
September 19, 2024, we entered into a note purchase agreement Purchase Agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah
limited liability company Holder ), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to Holder a secured promissory note in
an initial principal amount of 4,380,000 Initial Note payable on or before 24 months from the issuance date Maturity
Date and, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions in the Purchase Agreement, up to one additional secured promissory note Subsequent Note, Initial Note and Subsequent Note, Notes ). The initial principal amount of the Notes includes
an original issue discount of 9 and expenses the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder s transaction costs.
The original issue discount of the Initial Note was 360,000. Interest on the principal amount of the Notes accrues at a rate of 9 per
annum. The Company may pay all or any portion of the amount owed under the Notes earlier than it is due. All payments made under the
Notes, including any repayments, are subject to an exit fee of 6 of the portion of the outstanding balance (including accrued interest)
being repaid. The Subsequent Note would have a principal amount of 2,180,000, which will have terms substantially similar to the terms
of the Initial Note. The original issue discount on the Subsequent Note, if issued, will be 180,000. 

The
Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants and agreements, including that we will not pledge or grant any lien or security interest
in our or our subsidiaries assets without the Holder s prior written consent and that we will file reports under the Securities
Exchange Act timely, and that our shares will continue to be listed or quoted on the NYSE American or Nasdaq. Also, without the Holder s
prior written consent, we may not: issue, incur or guarantee any debt obligations other than trade payables in the ordinary course; issue
any security that has conversion rights in which the number of shares varies with the market price of our shares; issue any securities
convertible into our shares with a conversion price that varies with the market price of our shares; issue any securities that have a
conversion or exercise price subject to a reset due to a change in the market price of our shares or upon the occurrence of certain events
related to our business (but excluding certain standard antidilution protection for any reorganization, recapitalization, noncash dividend,
stock split or similar transaction); issue and securities pursuant to an equity line of credit, standby equity purchase agreement or
similar arrangement. The Purchase Agreement also contains a most favored nations provision that provides we will grant to the Holder
the same terms as we offer any subsequent investor in our debt securities and certain arbitration provisions in the event of a claim
arising under the Purchase Agreement and other transaction documents. 

The
Notes contain certain trigger events, including in the event that: (a) we fail to pay any amount when due; (b) a receiver or trustee
is appointed with respect to our assets; (c) we become insolvent; (d) we make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (e) we
file a petition under bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws; (f) an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is filed against us; (g) a
 fundamental transaction occurs without Holder s prior written consent: (h) we, USCF Investments or any of the
USCF Investments subsidiaries, fail to observe covenants in our agreements with the Holder; (i) we default in observing or
performing any covenant in the transaction documents; (j) any representation in the transaction documents is or becomes false or
incorrect; (i) we effect a reverse stock split without 20 trading days prior written notice to the Holder; (k) any judgment
is entered against us for more than 500,000 which remains unstayed for more than 20 days unless consented to by the Holder; (m) our
shares cease to be DTC (Depositary Trust Company) eligible; or (n) we breach any covenant or agreement in any other agreement with
Holder or in any financing or other agreement that affects our ongoing business operations. A fundamental transaction 
occurs if: we merge with another entity; we dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, we allow more than 50 of our voting
shares to be acquired by another person; we enter into a share purchase agreement with a third party that acquires more than 50 of
our shares; we recapitalize or reclassify our shares; we transfer a material asset to a subsidiary; we pay a dividend to our
shareholders; or any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 50 of the ordinary voting power of our shares. Upon the
occurrence of a trigger event, the Holder may increase the amount outstanding under a Note by 10 for an event described in (a)
through (h) above or 5 for an event described in (i) through (n) above (a default amount ). Alternatively, the Holder
may treat the trigger event as an event of default and demand repayment of the Note, subject to a five-day cure period, together
with any applicable default amount. 

The
Company s obligations under the Note are secured by: (i) a pledge of all the common stock the Company owns in USCF
Investments, Inc. and (ii) a security interest in all of the assets of the Company. Further, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer s trust, the Nicholas and Melinda Gerber Living Trust Gerber Trust ), provided: (i) a guaranty of the
Company s obligations to the Holder under the Note and (ii) a pledge of all of the common stock of the Company owned by the
Gerber Trust. 

Beginning
on the date that is six months from the issuance date until the applicable Note is paid in full, each month the Holder has the right
to require the Company to redeem up to an aggregate of 400,000 with respect to the Initial Note and 200,000 with respect to the Subsequent
Note plus any interest accrued thereunder and an exit fee of 6 of the principal amount and accrued interest redeemed. The Company has
the right to defer such redemption payments that Holder could otherwise elect to make three times by providing advance written notice
to Holder. If Company exercises its deferral right, the outstanding balance automatically increases by 0.85 for each instance that the
deferral right is exercised by Company, which cannot be exercised more than once every ninety calendar days. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, beginning on the date of the issuance and sale of the Note and ending 24 months later, Holder
will have the right, but not the obligation, with Company s prior written consent, to reinvest up to an additional 10,000,000
in the Company on the same terms and conditions as the Notes (structured as two tranches of 5,000,000 each). 

The
Company engaged Maxim Group LLC to serve as placement agent for the transaction between the Company and Holder in exchange for an aggregate
commission equal to 7 of the gross cash proceeds received from the sale of the Notes. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the note payable balance outstanding, net of the original issue discount and fees paid, was 3.7 million, of which 2.8 million is due within 12 months from September 30, 2024
and the remaining balance of 0.9 million is due prior to September 30, 2026. The effective interest rate for this note is 41.3 . 

In
July 2024, Brigadier repaid its mortgage loan of 0.3 million in full that was secured with the land and building in Canada. 

Investments 

USCF
Investments, from time to time, provides initial investments in the creation of ETP funds that USCF Investments manages. USCF Investments
classifies these investments as current assets as these investments are generally sold within one year from the balance sheet date. As
of September 30, 2024, USCF Investments held investment positions in four of its 40 Act funds, USG (ticker changed from GLDX in March 2024), ZSB,
USE and ZSC of 1.5 million, 0.4 million, 3.2 million, and 2.3 million, respectively. These investment positions along with other investments,
as applicable, are described further in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. 

Dividends 

Our
strategy on dividends is to declare and pay dividends only from retained earnings and only when our Board of Directors deems it prudent
and in the best interests of the Company to declare and pay dividends. We have historically not paid any dividends on our shares of common
or preferred stock and we have no current plans to pay dividends. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Marygold Companies maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurances that the information
required to be disclosed in The Marygold Companies periodic reports filed or submitted under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures and any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

The
duly appointed officers of The Marygold Companies, including its chief executive officer and chief accounting officer, who perform functions
equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of The Marygold Companies, have evaluated the effectiveness
of The Marygold Companies disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of
The Marygold Companies were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

(b)
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

Refer
to Note 10. Commitments And Contingencies Litigation in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

The
Marygold Companies and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as we, us, our or similar expressions)
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in their business operations. In addition to the other information set forth in this report,
you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2024 2024 Form 10-K ), which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or
operating results. The risks described in our 2024 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and/or operating results. 

See
risk factors discussed in Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read in connection with the
other information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and our financial statements and the related notes, specifically Liquidity and Capital Resources
 Recent Note Financing. 

In
addition to the Risk Factors included in our 2024 Form 10-K we are adding the following risk factor in connection with
our recent debt financing. 

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash
flow from operations to repay amounts due under our recent debt financing or other obligations we have incurred which could adversely
affect our business, including our ability to further develop and market our Fintech app, as well as our financial condition, results
of operations, and our stock price. 

We
recently entered into a significant debt financing transaction, which has increased our financial leverage. This heightened level of
indebtedness could limit our ability to operate effectively and may expose us to various risks, including: 

1) Inability
 to repay debt when due: Our cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our debt service obligations,
 especially if our revenues and/or cash flows from operations decline or if we encounter unforeseen operational or other challenges.
 Failure to repay this debt when due could lead to a default under the terms of our debt agreements. 
 
 2) Event
 of default consequences: The occurrence of an event of default under our debt agreements could result in the acceleration of our
 indebtedness, requiring immediate repayment of outstanding amounts an increase in the amount due, and a requirement to pay an
 increased (or default) rate of interest on the outstanding amount due. Our obligations under the debt agreements are secured by a
 pledge of our shares in USCF Investments and a security interest in all our assets enabling the lender to foreclose on our assets
 upon the occurrence of an event of default. Further, the performance of our obligations under the debt agreements is guaranteed by
 the Gerber Trust and our obligations under the note are secured by a pledge of all the shares of Marygold owned by the Gerber Trust,
 of which our CEO is a trustee. An event of a default under the debt agreements could force us to liquidate assets, seek additional
 financing, or restructure our obligations, all of which may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. There can be no assurance we will be able to liquidate our assets, restructure
our indebtedness, or obtain additional financing upon terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 3) Restrictive
covenants: Our debt agreements contain certain covenants that restrict our operational flexibility, including limitations on
mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, and our ability to engage in certain equity linked financing transactions in which the conversion
or exercise price of any debt or other equity linked securities we issue in the transaction varies with the market price of our shares
or upon the occurrence of certain trigger events, and other strategic initiatives. Our non-compliance with these covenants could lead
to an event of default and further exacerbate our financial position. 

Failure
to manage these risks effectively or repay our debt when due could result in severe financial and operational consequences, including
a potential reduction in the market price of our securities and a negative impact on our shareholders. 

 Also, if we issue additional shares in a financing,
any such issuance could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Note Financing.
