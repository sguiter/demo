 and has significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the near future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due. As a result, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon achieving profitable operations. 
 
 Management has raised additional capital through private placement offerings and has plans to raise funds through public offering of its capital stock. While the Company has been successful in securing such financing in the past, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future. Accordingly, these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments, relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 
 
 All adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, considered necessary for fair presentation have been included in these financial statements.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and summary of selected financial data for iWallet Corporation Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management. 
 
 Overview 
 
 iWallet Corporation (the Company or iWallet was incorporated on November 18, 2009, in the State of California as Queensridge Mining Resources, Inc. On or about July 21, 2014, iWallet Corporation, a private California corporation, merged with and into our wholly owned Nevada subsidiary, iWallet Acquisition Corp., and iWallet Acquisition Corp. then immediately merged with and into the Company, with the Company immediately changing its name to iWallet Corporation.

 The Company was previously a public company required to file reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as a result of effectiveness of prior registration statements we filed with the SEC in 2010 and 2014, but our reporting obligations were automatically suspended as a result of having less than 300 shareholders of record, and we subsequently filed a Form 15 (a Notice of the suspension of our duty to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act) and discontinued reporting in 2016.

 Results of Operations 
 
 The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, which are included herein. 
 
 Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). 
 
 Going Concern Qualification 
 
 Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of 5,565,425 since its inception through September 30, 2024, and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

 At September 30, 2024, we had 4,498 of cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of 5,565,425.

 Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements on the unaudited financial statements as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 included in this Form 10-Q, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. Management bases its estimates 
 15 
 
 on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. 
 
 Management believes the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, and income taxes. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company s business plan is to derive revenue primarily from the sale and engraving of its wallets and consulting services within the smart wallet sector. Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under ASC 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
 Intangible Assets 
 
 Patents and trademarks are measured at cost. Legal fees associated with patents and trademarks, which are expected to be issued, are recorded as patents and trademarks on the balance sheets. Upon approval by the relevant patent office, the patents and trademarks are amortized over their respective expected lives. Patent and trademark costs associated with patents or trademarks which are not approved or are abandoned, are expensed in the period in which such patents are not approved. 
 
 The Company expects to maintain patents for up to 20 years from the effective date and the trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks remain in use and the required filings are made to keep them in use. However, based on the Company s assessment of potential innovation or other competing technological developments a useful life of ten years has been assessed for both the patents and the trademarks. 
 
 Software consists of costs relating to the development of the software behind the biometric scanning and the other security programs involved in the wallets. Costs relating to the development of this software are capitalized and amortized over its estimated useful life of ten years. 
 
 Website development costs relating to website and mobile application and software development are also capitalized and amortized over its estimated useful life of three years. 
 
 ASC 350-20, Goodwill, and 350-30, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, require intangible assets with a finite life be tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated discounted cash flow used in determining the fair value of the asset. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires, among other things, a liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company is required to make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law, the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters. In the 
 16 
 
 event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than the Company s estimates, or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes, the Company will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur. Such adjustments may have a material impact on the Company s income tax provision and results of operations. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean the company s controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
