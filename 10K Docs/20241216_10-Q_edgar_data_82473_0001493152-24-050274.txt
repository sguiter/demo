to make further UniGen Investments in the future. 

Hotel
Operations: 

Our
Tucson, Arizona Hotel and our Hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico are moderate service hotels. Both hotels offer swimming pools,
fitness centers, business centers, and complimentary breakfast. In addition, the Hotels offer complementary social areas and modest conference
facilities. The Tucson hotel has PJ s Pub and Caf , as well. 

The
Trust is the sole general partner of RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited liability limited partnership (the Partnership ),
and owned a interest in the Partnership as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively. The Trust s weighted
average ownership for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was , respectively. As of October 31, 2024, the Partnership
owned a interest in an InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona. The Trust owns a direct interest in an InnSuites 
hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

RRF
Limited Liability Limited Partnership, an IHT subsidiary, manages the Hotels daily operations under 2 management agreements. RRF
also provides the use of the InnSuites trademark to the Hotels. All expenses and reimbursements between the Trust and RRF
LLLP have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The
Trust classified the Hotels as operating assets, but these assets are available for sale. At this time, the Trust is unable to predict
when, and if, either of these will be sold. Neither the Tucson Hotel nor the Albuquerque Hotel is currently listed for sale, but the
Trust is willing to consider offers for each Hotel. Each of the Hotels is being made available at a price that management believes is
reasonable in relation to its current fair market value, earnings, profits, and replacement cost. 

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), and include all assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of the Trust and its subsidiaries, as listed in the table below. All material intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Certain items have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. The Trust exercises unilateral
control over the Partnership and the entities listed below. Therefore, the unaudited condensed financial statements of the Partnership
and the entities listed below are consolidated with the Trust, and all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

(i) 

PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT 

The
Partnership Agreement of the Partnership provides for the issuance of two classes of Limited Liability Limited Partnership units, Class
A and Class B. Class A and Class B Partnership units are identical in all respects. On October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, 
and Class A Partnership units were issued and outstanding, representing of the total Partnership units, respectively. Additionally,
as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, Class B Partnership units were outstanding, owned by James Wirth, the Trust s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Wirth s affiliates, representing ownership in the Partnership. If all the
Class A and B Partnership units were converted on October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, the limited partners in the Partnership would
receive and Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust, respectively. As of October 31, 2024, and January 31, 2024,
the Trust owns general partner units in the Partnership, representing of the total Partnership units. 

LIQUIDITY 

The
Trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements is revenues from hotel room reservations and from RRF Management
fees from the Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico properties. The Trust s liquidity, including our ability to make distributions
to its shareholders, and to service debt, will depend upon the ability of the Trust and the Partnership s ability to generate sufficient
cash flow from hotel operations, as well as to generate funds from repayment of intercompany advances and sale of assets. 

At
a future date, the Trust may receive cash from energy operations and/or full or partial sale of one or both hotels, and/or full or partial
sale of its UniGen diversification investment. 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Trust had a related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with an amount payable of approximately
 . The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note accrues interest at per annum and requires interest only payments. The Demand/Revolving
Line of Credit/Promissory Note has a maximum borrowing capacity to , which automatically renews annually. This is a two-way
Line of Credit, with both the Trust and an Affiliate lender having access to draw on the credit amount of up to for either
party. 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Trust had three Revolving lines of Credit totaling with the Republic Bank of Arizona. The lines had
a balance as of October 31, 2024. 

With
approximately of cash, as of October 31, 2024, the availability of from the combined Advance to Affiliate
credit facilities, and the Revolving Lines of Credit with Republic Bank, the Trust believes that it has and will have enough
cash on hand to meet all of the financial obligations as they become due for twelve months from the date of filing this 10-Q. In addition,
management is analyzing strategic options available to the Trust, including the sale of one or both Hotel properties, or other investments.
However, such transactions may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Trust, or at all. 

There
can be no assurance that the Trust will be successful selling properties, merging, or raising additional or replacement funds, or that
these funds may be available on terms that are favorable to it. If the Trust is unable to raise additional or replacement funds, it may
be required to sell or refinance certain of our assets to meet liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. 

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Trust in accordance with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles GAAP ), for interim financial information, and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. However, the Trust believes that
the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
primarily of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 

Operating
results for the Fiscal Nine Months ended October 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
Fiscal Year ending January 31, 2025. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2024. 

The
Trust has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the filing of its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
Trust changed Auditors and Transfer Agents in the Second Fiscal Quarter (May 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024). Other than these, and those events
disclosed indicating the recovery of economic and business activity, the Company is not aware of any other significant events that occurred
subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to the filing of this report that would have a material impact on the Trust s financial
statements. 

As
the general partner of the Partnership, the Trust exercises unilateral control over the Partnership. Therefore, the financial statements
of the Partnership are consolidated with the Trust, and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Under
Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810-10-25, Albuquerque Suite Hospitality, LLC has been determined to be a
variable interest entity with the Partnership as the primary beneficiary (see Note 4 Variable Interest Entity ).
Therefore, the financial statements of Albuquerque Suite Hospitality, LLC, are consolidated with the Trust, and all significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

The
financial statements of the Partnership and Tucson Hospitality Properties, LLLP are consolidated with the Partnership and the Trust,
and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

SEASONALITY
OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS 

The
Hotels operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The Tucson Arizona Hotel historically experiences the highest occupancy
in the first Fiscal Quarter (the winter high season) and, to a lesser extent, the fourth Fiscal Quarter. The second Fiscal Quarter (summer
low season) historically tends to be the lowest occupancy period at this Arizona Hotel. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause
fluctuations in the Trust s quarterly revenues. The Hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico historically experiences its most
profitable periods during the second and third Fiscal Quarters (the summer high season), providing some balance to the general seasonality
of the Trust s hotel business. 

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as travel disruptions, labor force shortages
and cash flow issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened virus pandemic, terrorist attack, international conflict,
data breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather should occur at either of its two hotels, the adverse impact to the Trust s
revenues and profit could be significant. 

years for buildings and improvements, and to years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. 

Land
is an indefinite-lived asset. The Trust tests its land for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicates
an impairment may have occurred, by comparing its carrying value to its implied fair value. 

For
tax purposes the Trust takes advantage of accelerated depreciation methods (MACRS) for new capital additions and improvements to its
Hotels. 

Management
applies guidance ASC 360-10-35, to determine when it is required to test an asset for recoverability of its carrying value and whether,
or not, an impairment exists. Under ASC 360-10-35, the Trust is required to test a long-lived asset for impairment when there is an indicator
of impairment. Impairment indicators may include, but are not limited to, a drop in the performance of a long-lived asset, a decline
in the hospitality industry or a decline in the economy. If an indicator of potential impairment is present, then an assessment is performed
of whether the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows over its estimated remaining life. 

If
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s estimated remaining life are greater than the asset s carrying
value, no impairment is recognized; however, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows,
then the Trust would recognize an impairment expense to the extent the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The
estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance, and may differ
from actual cash flows. Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are analyzed on a property-specific basis independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets. Evaluation of future cash flows is based on historical experience and other factors, including certain
economic conditions, and committed future bookings. Management has determined no impairment is required of long-lived assets for the
Fiscal Period ended October 31, 2024. 

Revenues
primarily currently consist of room rentals, food and beverage sales, management and trademark fees and other miscellaneous revenues
from our properties. Revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied and when food and beverage sales are delivered. Management and trademark
fees include a monthly accounting fee and a percentage of hotel room revenues for managing the daily operations of the Hotels. 

Each
room night consumed by a guest with a cancelable reservation represents a contract whereby the Trust has a performance obligation to
provide the room night at an agreed upon price. For cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue as each performance obligation
(i.e., each room night) is met. Such contract is renewed if the guest continues their stay. For room nights consumed by a guest with
a non-cancellable reservation, the entire reservation period represents the contract term whereby the Trust has a performance obligation
to provide the room night or nights at an agreed upon price. For non-cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue over the
term of the performance period (i.e., the reservation period) as room nights are consumed. For these reservations, the room rate is typically
fixed over the reservation period. The Trust uses an output method based on performance completed to date (i.e., room nights consumed)
to determine the amount of revenue it recognizes on a daily basis if the length of a non-cancellable reservation exceeds one night since
consumption of room nights indicates when services are transferred to the guest. In certain instances, variable consideration may exist
with respect to the transaction price, such as discounts, coupons and price concessions made upon guest checkout. 

In
evaluating its performance obligation, the Trust bundles the obligation to provide the guest the room itself with other obligations (such
as free Wi-Fi, complimentary breakfast, and high speed internet), as the other obligations are not distinct and separable because the
guest cannot benefit from the additional amenities without the consumed room night. The Trust s obligation to provide the additional
items or services is not separately identifiable from the fundamental contractual obligation (i.e., providing the room and its contents).
The Trust has no performance obligations once a guest s stay is complete. 

of balances over 90 days due and of balances over 120 days due. Accounts receivable are
written off when collection efforts have been exhausted and they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries, if any, of receivables previously
written off are recorded when received. The Trust does not charge interest on accounts receivable balances and these receivables are
unsecured. There is in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods ended October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024. 

IHT fully paid restricted Shares per year. All shares vest over one year
from date of grant. The Trust has paid the annual fees due to its Trustees by issuing Shares of Beneficial Interest out of its authorized
but unissued Shares. Upon issuance, the Trust recognizes the shares as outstanding. The Trust recognizes expense related to the issuance

which the shares vest to the Trustees. From time to time, the Trustees and key employees receive one-time fully paid restricted share

Shares of the Beneficial Interest, as discussed in Note 1. 

For
the Fiscal Nine Months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, there were Class A and Class B Partnership
units outstanding, which are convertible into Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. Assuming conversion at the beginning of each
period, the aggregate weighted-average of these Shares of Beneficial Interest would have been in addition to the basic shares
outstanding for the Fiscal Third Quarter, Fiscal Three Months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These Shares of Beneficial
Interest issuable upon conversion of the Class A and Class B Partnership units were anti-dilutive during the three months ended October
31, 2024 and 2023 and are excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for those periods. 

and for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and 
and for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
Trust has assets that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, including stock and warrants in a 3 rd party private
company on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Due
to their short maturities, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value. The fair value of mortgage notes payable, notes payable to banks and notes and advances payable to related parties
is estimated by using the current rates which would be available for similar loans having the same remaining maturities and are based
on level 3 inputs. 

(the Loan Amount at an annual interest rate of (approximately per quarter). The Debentures are convertible into Class A shares of
UniGen Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of per share. 

UniGen
issued the Trust common stock purchase warrants (the Debenture Warrants to purchase up to shares of Class A
Common Stock. The Debenture Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of per share of Class A Common Stock. 

UniGen
also issued the Trust additional common stock purchase warrants Additional Warrants to purchase up to shares
of UniGen Class A Common Stock. The Additional Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of per share of Class A Common Stock. 

The
total of all stock ownership upon conversion of the note receivable is million shares and if all stock warrants available are exercised,
shares from conversion of the note receivable and shares from the exercise of warrants could total approximately million UniGen shares,
which amounts up to approximately - of fully diluted UniGen equity. 

On
the Trust s balance sheet, the investment of the consists of approximately in note receivables and approximately

During
the Fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, the Trust reinvested of interest income to exercise warrants for shares
of common stock in UniGen. 

During
the First Fiscal Quarter (February 1, 2024 to April 30, 2024), three months ended April 30, 2024, the Trust reinvested of interest
income to exercise warrants for shares of common stock in UniGen. 

During
the Second Fiscal Quarter (May 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024), three months ended July 31, 2024, as well as the Third Fiscal Quarter (August
1, 2024 to October 31, 2024), three months ended October 31, 2024, the Trust did not receive any interest income from UniGen, and thus
did not exercise any warrants for additional shares of common stock in UniGen. 

As
of October 31, 2024, IHT held common shares of UniGen, purchased at a cost of . Management believes recording the investment
at cost approximates fair value since there have been no significant changes in the operations of UniGen and UniGen s projects
are still in the developmental R D phase. 

UniGen
Power Inc. (UPI), progress of the UPI efficient clean energy innovation is as follows: 

1.
UniGen largely completed engineering, and is now focused on raising additional capital, which is an ongoing process. IHT may/may not
participate, at a future date. 

2.
Due to an increasingly unreliable American power grid, increasing demand for electric vehicles, increasing demand for data center power,
Artificial Intelligence electricity demand, inflation, and supply chain pressures, the UniGen marketing team estimates product s
market has grown, and is projected to double over the next five years. UniGen previously increased the MSP planned power plant price.
The initial order for thirty units has been reaffirmed. 

James
Wirth (President) and Marc Berg (Executive Vice President) both lack significant control. They have two of the five Board of Directors
seats or and were elected in December 2019 to serve on the board of UniGen. This product is a potentially power industry disruptive
relatively clean energy generation innovation. 

The
Trust has valued UniGen investment as a level 3 fair value measurement, for the following reasons: The investment does not qualify for
level 1 since there are no identical actively traded instruments or level 2 identical or similar unobservable markets.

with a two-unit minimum subscription. The Trust maintains at least of the units in one of the entities and intends to maintain
this minimum ownership percentage. Generally, the units in the each of the entities are allocated to three classes with differing cumulative
discretionary priority distribution rights through a certain time period. Class A units are owned by unrelated third parties and have
priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Trust and have second priority for distributions. Class C units are owned
by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority for distributions. Priority distributions of per unit
per year are cumulative until a certain date; however, after that date, generally Class A unit holders continue to hold a preference
on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. The Trust does not accrue for these distributions as the preference periods have
expired.

if the overallotment is exercised) units. Under the terms of the updated restructuring agreement, the Partnership agreed to hold at
least 
of the outstanding limited partnership units in the Tucson entity, on a post-transaction basis, and intends to maintain this minimum
ownership percentage through the purchase of units under this offering. The Board of Trustees approved this restructuring on
September 14, 2013. The limited partnership interests in the Tucson entity are allocated to three classes with differing cumulative
discretionary priority distribution rights through June 30, 2017. Class A units are owned by unrelated third parties and have
priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Partnership and have second priority for distributions. Class C units are
owned by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority for distributions from the Tucson entity. Priority
distributions of 
per unit per year are cumulative until June 30, 2016; however, after June 30, 2016 Class A unit holders continue to hold a
preference on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. The Trust does not accrue for these distributions as the
preference periods have expired.

Membership
Agreements: 

The
Tucson and Albuquerque Hotels have entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. Best Western for both hotel properties. In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, both Hotels pay fees to Best
Western based on reservations received through the use of the Best Western reservation system and the number of available suites at the
Hotels. The agreements with Best Western have no specific expiration terms and may be cancelled annually by either party. Best Western
requires that the hotels meet certain requirements for room quality. The two Best Western Hotels receive significant reservations through
the Best Western reservation system, and through Online Travel Agent (OTA) reservations systems, Expedia and Booking.com. Under these
arrangements, fees paid for membership fees and reservations were approximately and for the nine months ended October
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs include fees for the Albuquerque and Tucson hotels in 2024. These fees are included in room
operating expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for Albuquerque and Tucson. 

Litigation: 

The
nature of the operations of the Hotels exposes them to risks of claims and litigation in the normal course of their business. Although
the outcome of these matters cannot be determined and are generally covered by insurance, management does not expect that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, results of
operations or liquidity of the Trust. 

Indemnification: 

The
Trust has entered into indemnification agreements with all our executive officers and Trustees. The agreements provide for indemnification
against all liabilities and expenses reasonably incurred by an officer or Trustee in connection with the defense or disposition of any
suit or other proceeding, in which he or she may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened, while in office or thereafter,
because of his or her position at the Trust. There is no indemnification for any matter as to which an officer or Trustee is adjudicated
to have acted in bad faith, with willful misconduct or reckless disregard of his or her duties, with gross negligence, or not in good
faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the Trust s best interests. These agreements require the Trust, among
other things, to indemnify the Trustee or officer against specified expenses and liabilities, such as attorneys fees, judgments,
fines and settlements, paid by the individual in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of the individual s
status or service as our Trustee or officer, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct or conduct that is knowingly fraudulent
or deliberately dishonest, and to advance expenses incurred by the individual in connection with any proceeding against the individual
with respect to which the individual may be entitled to indemnification by us. The Trust may advance payments in connection with indemnification
under the agreements. The level of indemnification is to the full extent of the net equity based on appraised and/or market value of
the Trust. Historically, the Trust has not incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded
for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

OVERVIEW 

We
are engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties. On October 31, 2024 the Trust had two moderate-service hotels, one in
Tucson, Arizona and one in Albuquerque, New Mexico with 270 hotel suites. Both of our Trust Hotels are branded through membership agreements
with Best Western, and both are also trademarked as InnSuites Hotels and Suites. We are also involved in various operations incidental
to the operation of hotels, such as the operation of a limited service restaurant, and bar, as well as meeting/banquet room rentals. 

At
October 31, 2024, we owned a direct 21.90 interest in the Albuquerque, New Mexico Hotel, and, together with the Partnership, owned an
indirect 51.62 interest in the Tucson, Arizona Hotel. 

Trust
operations consist of one reportable segment Hotel Ownership Hotel Management Services. Hotel Ownership Operations derives
its revenue from the operation of the Trust s two hotel properties with an aggregate of 270 hotel suites in Arizona and New Mexico.
Hotel management services, provides management services for the Trust s two Hotels. As part of our management services, we also
provide trademark and licensing services. 

Our
results are significantly affected by the overall economy and travel, occupancy and room rates at the Hotels, our ability to manage costs,
changes in room rates, and changes in the number of available suites caused by the Trust s disposition activities. Results are
also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry. Unfavorable changes in these factors,
such as the virus-related travel slowdown in the Fiscal Year starting February 1, 2020, can and have negatively impacted hotel room demand
and pricing, which reduces our profit margins. Additionally, our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant inflationary
increases in operating expenses, resulting in lower operating margins, and higher hourly labor costs. Further increases in area hotel
supply, hourly labor cost, declines in demand, or declines in room rates, could result in increased competition, which could have an
adverse effect on the rates, revenue, costs, and profits of the Hotels in their respective markets. 

25 

Over
time, we expect our high risk but also high profit potential UniGen diversification efficient clean energy generation investment, to
grow and provide a substantial source of income in the future. 

We
expect the current Fiscal Year 2025 to be continued growth of the travel industry, stable high level Hotel occupancy, continued recovery
and increases of room rates, as well as continuation of current cost control all leading to improved profitability of our hotels. We
believe that we have positioned the Hotels to remain competitive through our completed Tucson and Albuquerque hotel refurbishments, by
offering fully refurbished studios and two-room suites at each location, and by maintaining complementary guest items, including complimentary
hot breakfast and free high speed Internet access. 

Our
strategic plan is to continue to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity, by ultimately obtaining full market value for our
two Hotels at market value, which is believed by management to be substantially higher than lower book values, over the next 36 months.
In addition, the Trust is seeking a larger private reverse merger partner that may benefit from a merger that would afford that partner
access to our listing on the NYSE AMERICAN. 

In
the process of reviewing merger opportunities, the Trust identified in December 2019, and invested 1 million in UniGen Power, Inc. UniGen ),
an innovative efficient clean energy power generation company. The Trust has invested 1 million in debentures convertible into 1 million
shares of UniGen Power Inc., the Trust has invested in 575,000 UniGen shares, and in addition has acquired warrants to purchase approximately
an additional up to 2 million UniGen shares over the next approximately two years, which could result in up to 15-20 or more ownership
in UniGen. For more information on our strategic plan, including information on our progress in disposing of our hotel properties and
expanding energy diversification, see Future Positioning in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

HOTEL
OPERATIONS 

Our
expenses consist primarily of labor, property taxes, insurance, corporate overhead, interest on mortgage debt, professional fees, depreciation
of the Hotels and hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll, guest and maintenance supplies, marketing,
and utilities expenses. Under the terms of its Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses.
Accordingly, management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the Hotels, particularly with respect
to occupancy, which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available, average daily rate ADR ),
calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold, and revenue per available room REVPAR ),
calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available, is appropriate for understanding revenue from the Hotels.

for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.2 million. In the prior Fiscal Years ended January 31,
2023, 2022 and 2021, we made significant improvements to our Albuquerque, New Mexico and Tucson, Arizona hotels. During the nine

and food and beverage revenues. 

EXPENSES: 

Total
expenses net of interest expense was approximately 6.21 million for the
nine months ended October 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of approximately 0.33 million, or 6 , compared to total expenses net of interest
expense of approximately 5.88 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating
expenses related to higher costs at the hotel properties. 

Room
expenses consisting of salaries and related employment taxes for property
management, front office, housekeeping personnel, reservation fees and room supplies were approximately 1.93 million for the nine months
ended October 31, 2024, compared to approximately 1.87 million in the prior year nine month period for an increase of approximately 69,000,
or 4 . Room expenses increased as occupancy at the hotels increased, and increased expenses were incurred with the increased occupancy.

General
and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management, accounting,
shareholder and legal services. General and administrative expenses of approximately 1.66 million for the nine months ended October 31,
2024, increased approximately 113,000 from approximately 1.77 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to less

Sales
and marketing expense increased approximately 55,000, or 19 , to approximately
 349,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, from approximately 294,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. Increased

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview
 Hotel Operations Corporate Overhead 

Two
principal sources of cash to meet our cash requirements, include monthly management fees from our two hotels and distributions of our
share of the Partnership s cash flow of the Tucson hotel and quarterly distributions from the Albuquerque, New Mexico properties.
Additional sources of cash include potential intercompany loan repayments, potential future real estate hotel sales, and potential returns
on diversified investments. The Partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the hotel property it owns in
Tucson, Arizona. Our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, will depend upon our ability, and the
Partnership s ability, to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations, from management fees, and from the potential sale
and/or refinance of the hotel, and to service our debt including repayment of intercompany loan from Tucson. 

Hotel
operations were positively affected by improved occupancy and substantially increased room rates at the Hotels in the Fiscal Year 2024,
and to a lesser extent, the First Three Fiscal Quarters of Fiscal 2025, ended October 31, 2024, as the travel industry continued to thrive. 

With
approximately 0.5 million of cash as of October 31, 2024 and the availability of three 250,000 bank lines of credit, and 1,200,000
available from the 2,000,000 related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note, and the availability of Advances to Affiliate
credit facilities and available Bank line of Credit, we believe that we will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial obligations
as they become due for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of the these consolidated financial statements. Our management
is analyzing other strategic options available to us, including raising additional funds, asset sales, and benefiting from clean energy
investment cash flow as our diversification investment progresses. However, such transactions may not be available on terms that are
favorable to us, or at all. 

IHT
and InnDependent Boutique Collections Hotels (IBC), previously agreed to extend the payment schedule on IBC s note receivable to
allow IBC to rebuild operations as the hotel industry rebounds. Management believes that with an additional extension repayment term,
that the future collectability of the current carrying value of the note is probable and not subject to further impairment, or allowance
for the Quarter ended October 31, 2024. 

There
can be no assurance that we will be successful fully collecting receivables, in refinancing debt, or raising additional or replacement
funds, or that these funds may be available on terms that are favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional or replacement funds,
we may be required to sell certain of our assets to meet our liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. 

We
anticipate steady leisure travel demand, modestly increased hotel rates, and limited additional new-build hotel supply in our markets
during the current Fiscal Year 2025, and accordingly we anticipate a continued increase of revenues. We expect challenges for the remaining
Fiscal Year to be the economy, inflation, and cost control. Travel, leisure, corporate, group, and government business continued to grow
and may further increase room rates while maintaining and/or building market share in Fiscal Year 2025. 

Cash
used in operating activities totaled approximately 651,000 during the nine months ended
October 31, 2024 as compared to net cash provided of approximately 1,511,000 during the nine months ended October 31, 2023. Consolidated
net loss was approximately 557,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to consolidated net income for the nine months
ended October 31, 2023 of approximately 612,000. Explanation of the differences between these Fiscal Years are explained above in the
results of operations of the Trust. 

Changes
in the adjustments to reconcile net income for the nine months ended October
31, 2024 and 2022, respectively, consist primarily of operating lease costs, stock-based compensation, hotel property depreciation, and
changes in assets and liabilities. Hotel property non-cash depreciation was approximately 521,000 during the nine months ended October
31, 2024 compared to approximately 502,000 during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, a increase of 19,000 as the Trust recognized
more depreciation for the increase of additional capitalized fixed assets. 

Changes
in assets and liabilities for accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled approximately 615,000) and 497,000) for the nine months ended October
31, 2024 and 2022, respectively. This significant decrease in changes in assets and liabilities for the nine months ended October 31,
2024 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was due to the decrease in operating liabilities related to ongoing operations. 

31 

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled approximately 368,000 for the
nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately 390,000 for the nine months ended
October 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in activities during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was due primarily due to less
capital improvements to our Hotel Properties as the Trust watched costs and cash flows. 

Net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities totaled approximately 145,000
and 1,328,000), respectively, for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase of approximately 1,473,000 was primarily
due to borrowing on the Notes Payable Related Party. 

Principal
payments on mortgage notes payable for continuing operations was approximately
 157,000 and 169,000 during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Borrowing and payments
on notes payables related party, netted against borrowings on note payable related party, was approximately 750,000 and 100,000)
of cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Treasury
Stock repurchases of IHT stock for cash was approximately 45,000 and 399,000 of cash used in financing activities during the nine
months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2024, our distributions to non-controlling interest holders was approximately 312,000 compared with
approximately 569,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. 

We
continue to contribute to a Capital Expenditures Fund (the Fund an amount equal to 4 of our Tucson InnSuites Hotel revenues
from operation of the Hotel. The Fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for our Tucson property. As of October 31, 2024, and 2023,
there were no monies held in these accounts reported on our unaudited condensed consolidated Balance Sheet as Restricted Cash. 
The Fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the Hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
During the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Hotel spent approximately 333,000 and 360,000 respectively, for capital
expenditures. The capital expenditures were primarily associated with the property improvements at the Hotel, as required to meet continuing
Best Western standards. We consider most of these improvements to be revenue producing. Therefore, these amounts are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. For the remaining Fiscal Year 2025 capital expenditures, we plan on spending less on capital
improvements as we have completed our property improvements at our Tucson, Arizona hotel and our Albuquerque hotel, both of which required
significant amounts of capital improvements in prior periods. Repairs and maintenance were charged to expense as incurred and approximated
 313,000 and 338,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We
have minimum debt payments, net of debt discounts, of approximately 59,000
and approximately 1,468,000 due during Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026, respectively. Minimum debt payments due during Fiscal Year 2025 and
2026 include approximately 59,000 and 248,000 of mortgage notes payable, and approximately 470,000 of other notes payable, which are
secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the Shares of Beneficial Interest and Partnership unit repurchases,
and 750,000 of Notes Payables due to Related Parties 

We
may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments. Any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured,
long-term, medium-term, or short-term, bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as we consider prudent. 

COMPETITION
IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY 

The
hotel industry is highly competitive. Both the Tucson and Albuquerque hotels experienced record high Gross Operating Profit (GOP Profits),
in Fiscal Year 2024 (February 1, 2023 to January 31, 2024), substantially higher than both Covid and Pre-Covid GOP Profits. This gross
operating profit is growing even more due to cost control measures. The drastic impact of COVID-19 to the world economy and hospitality
industry resulted in severely reduced occupancy and significant reduction in room rates, both of which have now fully recovered. Continued
competition in corporate, leisure, group, and government business in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to maintain
room rates and maintain market share. Each of the Hotels faces competition primarily from other mid-market hotels located in its immediate
vicinity, but also competes with hotel properties located in other geographic markets, and increasingly from alternative lodging facilities,
such as Airbnb. While none of the Hotels competitors dominate any of their geographic markets, some of those competitors may have
greater marketing and/or financial resources than the Trust. 

32 

Certain
hotel property refurbishments have been completed by competitors in both Hotels markets, and additional hotel property developments
may be built in the future. Such hotel developments could have an adverse effect on the revenue of our Hotels in their respective markets. 

The
Trust s hotel investments are located in Arizona and New Mexico. With the completed renovations meeting Best Western standards
at our Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico hotel properties, those hotels are expected to see incremental demand during the next
18 months. Supply has been relatively steady in those respective markets. Either a significant increase in supply or a significant decline
in demand could result in increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on occupancy, room rates and revenues of our Hotels
in their respective markets. The continued recovery has and is benefiting our hotels in the First Three Fiscal Quarters of Fiscal 2025,
February 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024. This improvement and continued upward trend is expected to continue for the balance of Fiscal Year
2025, through January 31, 2025. 

The
Trust may not invest further in hotels, but rather diversify into investments such as the investment made by the Trust in December 2019
in the innovative UniGen Power, Inc. (UniGen), efficient clean energy power generation company. The Trust may continue to seek further
diversification through a merger or reverse merger with a larger non-public entity seeking an NYSE-American public stock market listing. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

As
a partial balance to the current hotel industry, the Trust looks to benefit from, and expand, its UniGen clean energy operation diversification
investments in the years ahead. See Note 2 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements for discussion on UniGen. 

In
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024, we identified the critical
accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial
statements. We believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our Hotel properties, which constitute most of our assets, are
our most critical policies which has not changed in the period ended October 31, 2024. Those policies include methods used to recognize
and measure any identified impairment of our Hotel property assets. 

Asset
Impairment 

We
believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our hotel properties, which constitute most of our assets, are our most critical
policies. The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued authoritative guidance related to the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets, codified in ASC Topic 360-10-35, which we apply to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for
recoverability. On an events and circumstances basis, we review the carrying value of our hotel properties. We will record an impairment
loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and the current market value of the
property do not support it carrying value. In cases where we do not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for
use, we will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel, as determined by a current appraisal or other acceptable valuation
methods. We did not recognize a hotel properties impairment loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 or 2023. As of October 31,
2024, our management does not believe that the carrying values of any of our hotel properties are impaired. 

Sale
of Hotel Assets 

Management
believes that our currently owned Hotels are valued at prices that are reasonable in relation to their current fair market value. At
this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if, either of its Hotel properties will be sold. The Trust seeks to sell both hotels
over the next 36 months. We believe that each of the assets is available at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair
market value. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenues
are primarily derived from the sources below and are recognized as services are rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured.
Amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are considered deferred liabilities and are generally not significant. 

Revenues
primarily consist of room rentals, food and beverage sales, management and trademark fees and other miscellaneous revenues from our properties.
Revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied and when food and beverage sales are delivered. 

33 

Each
room night consumed by a guest with a cancelable reservation represents a contract whereby the Trust has a performance obligation to
provide the room night at an agreed upon price. For cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue as each performance obligation
(i.e., each room night) is met. Such contract is renewed if the guest continues their stay. For room nights consumed by a guest with
a non-cancellable reservation, the entire reservation period represents the contract term whereby the Trust has a performance obligation
to provide the room night or nights at an agreed upon price. For non-cancellable reservations, the Trust recognizes revenue over the
term of the performance period (i.e., the reservation period) as room nights are consumed. For these reservations, the room rate is typically
fixed over the reservation period. The Trust uses an output method based on performance completed to date (i.e., room nights consumed)
to determine the amount of revenue it recognizes on a daily basis if the length of a non-cancellable reservation exceeds one night since
consumption of room nights indicates when services are transferred to the guest. In certain instances, variable consideration may exist
with respect to the transaction price, such as discounts, coupons and price concessions made upon guest checkout. 

In
evaluating its performance obligation, the Trust bundles the obligation to provide the guest the room itself with other obligations (such
as free Wi-Fi, grab and go or hot breakfast, access to on-site laundry facilities and parking), as the other obligations are not distinct
and separable because the guest cannot benefit from the additional amenities without the consumed room night. The Trust s obligation
to provide the additional items or services is not separately identifiable from the fundamental contractual obligation (i.e., providing
the room and its contents). The Trust has no performance obligations once a guest s stay is complete. 

We
are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable
governmental agencies on a periodic basis. We have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent. We do not retain these taxes and
fees and, therefore, they are not included in revenues. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability
when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agency. 

COMPLIANCE
WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS OF NYSE AMERICAN 

The
Trust s Management received communication from the NYSE-American on August 29, 2022, indicating IHT is fully compliant with all
of the Continued Listing Standards Equity Requirements set forth in Part 10 of the NYSE American Company Guide, of the NYSE-American. 

34 

NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The
following non-GAAP presentations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and
funds from operations FFO are made to assist our investors in evaluating our operating performance. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, amortization of loan costs, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
and non-controlling interests in the Trust. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe these measurements (a) more accurately reflect
the ongoing performance of our hotel assets and other investments, (b) provide more useful information to investors as indicators of
our ability to meet our future debt payments and working capital requirements, and (c) provide an overall evaluation of our financial
condition. Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by us may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA reported by other companies that do not define
Adjusted EBITDA exactly as we define the term. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined
in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial
performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 

A
reconciliation of net income or loss attributable to controlling interests to Adjusted EBITDA for the nine and three months ended October
31, 2024 and 2023 is approximately as follows:

FFO
is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ),
which is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales
of properties, asset impairment adjustments, and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, plus non-cash depreciation and amortization
of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests in the operating partnership.
NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically
has not depreciated on the basis determined by GAAP. The Trust is an unincorporated Ohio business investment, (real estate investment
trust); however, the Trust is not a real estate investment trust for federal taxation purposes. Management uses this measurement to compare
itself to REITs with similar depreciable assets. We consider FFO to be an appropriate measure of our ongoing normalized operating performance.
We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported
by other companies that either do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or interpret the NAREIT definition
differently than us. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered
as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating
activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to
make cash distributions. However, to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, we believe that FFO should
be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements.

FUTURE
POSITIONING 

In
viewing the hotel industry cycles, the Board of Trustees determined that it was appropriate to continue to actively seek buyers for our
two remaining Hotel properties. We continue to make our Tucson Hotel and Albuquerque Hotel available for sale at market value, on the
website www.suitehotelsrealty.com. 

The
table below provides book values, mortgage balances and Estimated Market Asking Price for the Hotels.

 18,500,000 

6,839,295 
 9,093,184 
 28,000,000 

The
 Estimated Market Asking Price is the amount at which we believe we may be able to sell each of the Hotels and is adjusted
to reflect hotel sales in the Hotels areas of operation and projected upcoming 12 month earnings of each of the Hotels. The Estimated
Market Asking Price is not based on appraisals of the properties. 

We
have from time to time listed hotel properties with a long time highly successful local real estate hotel broker who has successfully
sold four of our hotel properties. We believe that each of the assets, the Tucson and Albuquerque hotels, have an estimated market asking
price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair market value. We plan to sell our remaining two Hotel properties within 36 months.
We can provide no assurance that we will be able to sell either or both of the Hotel properties on terms favorable to us or within our
expected time frame, or at all. 

Although
believed feasible, we may be unable to realize the asking price for the individual Hotel properties or to sell and/or refinance one or
both. However, we believe that the asking price values are reasonable based on current strong local market conditions, comparable sales,
and anticipated continued upturns in occupancy, rates, and profits per hotel. Changes in market conditions have in part resulted, and
may in the future result, in our changing one or all of the asking prices. 

Our
long-term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity, to benefit from our UniGen Power, Inc., (UniGen) clean
energy operation diversified investment, and to pursue a merger with another company, likely a private larger entity that seeks to go
public to list on the NYSE AMERICAN Exchange.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities. We do not have any majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries
that are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 

SEASONALITY 

The
Hotels operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The Tucson Arizona Hotel historically experiences the highest occupancy
in the first Fiscal Quarter (the winter high season) and, to a lesser extent, the fourth Fiscal Quarter. The second Fiscal Quarter (summer
low season) historically tends to be the lowest occupancy period at this Arizona Hotel. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause
fluctuations in the Trust s quarterly revenues. The Hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico historically experiences its most
profitable periods during the second and third Fiscal Quarters (the summer high season), providing some balance to the general seasonality
of the Trust s hotel business. 

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as travel disruptions, labor force shortages
and cash flow issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened virus pandemic, terrorist attack, international conflict,
data breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather should occur at either of its two hotels, the adverse impact to the Trust s
revenues and profit could be significant. 

INFLATION 

We
rely entirely on the performance of the Hotels and InnSuites ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels
in general, and InnSuites in particular, can change and do change room rates often and quickly, but competitive pressures may limit InnSuites
ability to raise rates as fast as or faster than inflation. During Fiscal Year 2024, ended January 31, 2024, InnSuites did experience
substantial increases in rates to offset the inflationary increase labor and other expenses. During the current Fiscal 2025, rates continue
to increase modestly, but are more stable. 

INVESTMENT
IN UNIGEN POWER, INC. 

On
December 16, 2019, the Trust entered into a Convertible Debenture Purchase Agreement with UniGen Power Inc. UniGen ). InnSuites
Hospitality Trust (IHT) made an initial 1 million diversification investment in late Fiscal Year 2020 and early Fiscal Year 2021. UniGen
is in the process of developing a patented high profit potential new efficient clean energy electricity generation innovation. 

The
total market demand for electricity is projected to double in the U.S. over the next five years due to sharply increased demand from
data centers, electric cars, and projected Artificial Intelligence usage. The initial investment was made December 16, 2019, with positive
progress to date despite the virus, economic setbacks, international vendor travel disruptions, cost overruns, and delays. The IHT investment
includes convertible bonds, stocks, and warrants to purchase UniGen stock upon election of the Trust. The investment is valued at fair
value (level 3), as defined in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. There is no Investment Commitment to UniGen requiring
any restriction of cash. 

The
Trust purchased secured convertible debentures Debentures in the aggregate amount of 1,000,000 (the Loan Amount (the Loan at an annual interest rate of 6 15,000 per quarter). The Debentures are convertible into 1,000,000 Class
A shares of UniGen Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 1.00 per share. UniGen is two quarters delinquent on quarterly interest
payments, and is currently seeking additional investors. 

The
Trust has purchased in addition approximately 575,000 shares of UniGen stock. 

UniGen
issued the Trust common stock purchase warrants (the Debenture Warrants including to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of
Class A Common Stock. The Debenture Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of 1.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. 

37 

UniGen,
also, issued the Trust additional common stock purchase warrants Additional Warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock. The Additional Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of 2.25 per share of Class A Common Stock. 

The
total of all stock ownership upon conversion of the debenture and exercise of warrants could amount to approximately up to 15-20 of
fully diluted UniGen equity. 

On
the Trust s balance sheet, the investment of the 1,668,750 consists of approximately 700,000 in note receivables, approximately
 300,000 as the fair value of the warrants issued with the Trust s investment in UniGen, and 668,750 of UniGen Common Stock (575,000
shares), at cost. The value of the premium related to the fair value of the warrant will accrete over the life of the debentures. 

Privately
held UniGen Power, Inc. (UniGen) is developing a patented high profit potential (high risk), new efficient clean energy generation innovation.
The investment is valued at fair value (level 3), as defined in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. There is no Investment
Commitment to UniGen requiring any restriction of cash. 

Engineering
work is largely complete on the prototype. UniGen is currently concentrating on its current round of capital raising. IHT may or may
not participate in an upcoming round of capital raising. 

UniGen
is a high risk investment offering high potential investment return if and when successful. 

Based
on a 96 core super computer simulated test together with advanced software, UniGen has confirmed that the UPI 1000TA engine
with the addition of recent potential technological advancements, is approximately 33 more fuel efficient than first estimated and will
emit only approximately 25 of the maximum admissions allowed by CARB, the strictest of the regulatory standards issued by the state
of California. Recent projections of demand for electricity including data centers, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence indicates
the market demand for electricity over the next five years in the U.S. may double. 

The
UniGen design is to produce generators fueled not only with abundant relatively clean natural gas but also with other even cleaner fuels
such as ethanol and hydrogen (that emits only water). 

James
Wirth (IHT President) and Marc Berg (IHT Executive Vice President) both lack significant UniGen control. They have two of the five UniGen
Board of Directors seats or 40 and were elected in December 2019 to serve on the board of UniGen to monitor and assist in the success
of this potentially power industry disruptive relatively clean energy generation innovation. 

The
Trust has valued UniGen investment as a level 3 fair value measurement, for the following reasons: The investment does not qualify for
level 1 since there are no identical actively traded instruments or level 2 identical or similar unobservable markets.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were fully effective as of October 31, 2024. 

Our
management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision
of the Trust s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Trust s Board of Trustees, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

38 

Assessment
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management s assessment, management concluded our internal control over
financial reporting was fully effective as of October 31, 2024. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate past deficiencies and enhance the Trust s internal control over financial reporting, the Trust previously
increased its technical accounting expertise through an increasingly seasoned Chief Financial Officer, and in Fiscal Years 2023/2024
promoting its Corporate Controller, and employing two full-time Senior Staff Accountants to assist with the Trust s technical accounting
and internal control issues. The CFO has extensive public company reporting experience, to further assist with the Trust s technical
accounting and internal controls. 

We
have taken several appropriate and reasonable additional steps, as outlined above, to make the necessary improvements to our Accounting
staff and internal control over financial reporting, which resulted in management providing the support previously needed with the additional
hiring and training of sufficient personnel with appropriate training and expertise in accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. This additional staffing and training has allowed us to make the necessary improvements, including: 

Continuing
 to improve the control environment through (i) being staffed with sufficient number of personnel to address segregation of duties
 issues, ineffective controls and to perform control monitoring activities, (ii) increasing the level of GAAP knowledge by retaining
 additional technical accountants, (iii) implementing formal process to account for non-standard transactions, and (iv) implementing
 and formalizing management oversight of financial reporting at regular intervals; 

Continuing
 to update the documentation of our internal control processes, including implementing formal risk assessment processes and entity
 level controls; 

Implementing
 control activities that address relevant risks and assure that all transactions are subject to such control activities; Ensure systems
 that impact financial information and disclosures have effective information technology controls; 

Implementing
 plan to increase oversight and review of ad hoc spreadsheets while also working to reduce their use; 

We
 are in the process of further enhancing the supervisory procedures to include additional
 levels of analysis and quality control reviews within the accounting and financial reporting
 functions; 

IHT
 previously strengthened the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to assist with the Trust s internal controls oversight;
 and 

IHT
 filled the position of Controller, to further assist with the Trust s internal controls oversight, and process accounting. 

We
believe that the remediation measures described above have and will continue to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting
and remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified. These remediation efforts were implemented throughout Fiscal Year 2024,
and early Fiscal Year 2025. Additional strengthening may take place in the balance of the current Fiscal Year 2025, as well. 

Our
management believes that our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended October 31,
2024 fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the periods covered by
this report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were continued positive changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. With the several new
additions aforementioned above, these new additions should assist with the Trust s stability, technical accounting, and internal
control issues.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks
Relating to COVID-19 

COVID-19
had a material detrimental impact on our business, financial results and liquidity, in Fiscal Year 2021, ended January 31, 2021. Its
consequences had dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms, in Fiscal Year 2021. We believe that lodging demand and revenue
level have now significantly recovered. 

Fiscal
Year 2024, starting February 1, 2023 and ending January 31, 2024, confirmed a significant strong rebound and encouraging progress. The
start of Fiscal Year 2025, starting February 1, 2024 and ending January 31, 2025, has shown no ill effects from the pandemic whatsoever. 

COVID-19
and its consequences previously reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms, which previously had an impact our business, operations, and
financial results. We believe that lodging demand and revenue level is now at full recovery. The extent to which COVID-19 currently impacts
our business, operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, is diminished. The negative impact
COVID-19 had on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on consumer discretionary
spending has been reduced significantly, and its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business,
and levels of consumer confidence is no longer considered a major factor for Fiscal Year 2025, (February 1, 2024 to January 31, 2025). 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Holders
of the Trust s Shares of Beneficial Interest are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Trustees of
the Trust out of funds legally available. The holders of Shares of Beneficial Interest, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-down
of the Trust, are entitled to share ratably in any assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities of the Trust. The Shares
of Beneficial Interest possess ordinary voting rights, each share entitling the holder thereof to one vote. Holders of Shares of Beneficial
Interest do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of Trustees and do not have preemptive rights. 

For
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Trust repurchased
0 and 120,126 Shares of Beneficial Interest at an average price of 0 and 1.44 per share, respectively. The average price paid includes
brokerage commissions. The Trust intends to continue repurchasing Shares of Beneficial Interest in compliance with applicable legal and
NYSE AMERICAN requirements. The Trust s management believes the Trust share price does not fully recognize the Trust s full
value and/or full potential. The Trust did not acquire any Shares of Beneficial Interest in open market transactions during the three
months ended October 31, 2024. During Fiscal Year 2024 (February 1, 2023 to January 31, 2024), the Trust repurchased 265,087 IHT Shares
at an average price of 1.72 per share.
