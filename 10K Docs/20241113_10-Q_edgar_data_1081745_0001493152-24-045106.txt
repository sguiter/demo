reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion.
Our Document Management segment, which includes the Yellow Folder assets acquired in April 2022
and the CEO Image asset acquisition in April 2020, consists primarily of solutions involving
our software platform, allowing customers to capture and manage their documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents
and digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. Our Document Conversion segment,
which includes and primarily consists of the Graphic Sciences acquisition, provides assistance to customers as a part of their overall
document strategy to convert documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, including migration to our software
solutions, as well as long-term storage and retrieval services. Our solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect
business-critical documents to the people who need them by making those documents easy to find and access, while also being secure and
compliant with the customers audit requirements. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers.

Deferred
revenue 

Amounts
that have been invoiced are recognized in accounts receivable, deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition
criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenues typically
relate to maintenance and software-as-a-service agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services,
and payments received for professional services and license arrangements and software-as-a-service performance obligations that have
been deferred until fulfilled under our revenue recognition policy. 

Remaining
performance obligations represent the transaction price from contracts for which work has not been performed or goods and services have
not been delivered. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months,
with the remainder recognized thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining
performance obligations for software as a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was .
As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for software as
a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was . This does not include revenue related
to performance obligations that are part of a contract whose original expected duration is one year or less.

a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. We intend to continue
maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or
some portion of these allowances. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and
a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance
release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. 

operating segments: Document Management and Document
Conversion. These segments contain individual business components that have been combined on the basis of common management, customers,
solutions offered, service processes and other economic characteristics. We currently have immaterial intersegment sales. We evaluate
the performance of our segments based on gross profits. 

The
Document Management Segment provides cloud-based and premise-based content services software. Its modular suite of solutions complements
existing operating and accounting systems to serve a mission-critical role for organizations to make content secure, compliant, and process-ready.
This segment conducts its primary operations in the United States. Markets served include highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive
markets in healthcare, K-12 education, public safety, other public sector, risk management, financial services, and others. Solutions
are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers. 

The
Document Conversion Segment provides services for scanning and indexing, converting images from paper to digital, paper to microfilm,
and microfiche to microfilm, as well as long-term physical document storage and retrieval. This segment conducts its primary operations
in the United States. Markets served include businesses and federal, county, and municipal governments. Solutions are sold both directly

ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
conditions and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Historical results and percentage relationships
among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods. Any
forward-looking statements in this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere herein. In this Quarterly Report, we sometimes refer to the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 as the third quarter 2024 and the nine-month period 2024 respectively, and to the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2023 as the third quarter 2023 and the nine-month period 2023. 

Company Overview 

We are a document services and software solutions
company serving both the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors with their digital transformation and process automation initiatives.
Our digital transformation products and services are provided through two reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion.
Our Document Management segment consists primarily of solutions involving our software platform, allowing customers to capture and manage
their documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365,
digital images, audio, video and emails. Our Document Conversion segment provides assistance to customers as a part of their overall document
strategy to convert documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, including migration to our software solutions,
as well as micrographics conversions and long-term storage and retrieval services. Our solutions create value for customers by making
it easy to connect business-critical documents to the people who need them by making those documents easy to find and access, while also
being secure and compliant with the customers audit requirements. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers. 

Our customers use our software by one of two methods:
purchasing our software and installing it onto their own equipment, which we refer to as a premise model, or licensing and
accessing our platform via the Internet, which we refer to as a software as a service or SaaS model and also
as a cloud-based model. Licensing of our software through our SaaS model has become increasingly popular among our customers,
especially in light of the increased deployment of remote workforce policies, and is a key ingredient in our revenue growth strategy.
Our SaaS products are hosted with Amazon Web Services, Expedient, and Corespace, providing our customers with reliable hosting services
that we believe are consistent with industry best practices in data security and performance. 

We operate a U.S.-based business with concentrated
sales to the State of Michigan for our Document Conversion segment, complemented by our diverse set of document management software solutions
and services. We hold or compete for leading positions regionally in select markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including
the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative solutions, and the quality of our service support.
Net growth in sales of software as a service in recent years reflects market demand for these solutions over traditional sales of on-premise
software. We expect to continue to benefit from our select niche leadership market positions, innovative product offerings, growing customer
base, and the impact of our sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and expanded
market penetration opportunities, more effective products and services pricing strategies, demonstrating superior value to customers,
increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and measurement, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and
lead nurturing processes. 

For further information about our consolidated revenue
and earnings, please see our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

How We Evaluate our Business Performance and Opportunities 

There has been no material change during the nine-month
period 2024 to the major qualitative and quantitative factors we consider in the evaluation of our operating results as set forth in Part
II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations How We Evaluate
our Business Performance and Opportunities of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Executive Overview of Results 

Revenues were up for the third quarter and
nine-month period 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 by 341,196, or 8.0 , and 1,044,610, or 8.2 , respectively, primarily
driven by software as a service and professional services more than offsetting expected weakness in storage and retrieval and sales
of direct premise software. Operating expenses for the nine-month period 2024 increased 28.2 , primarily driven by share based
compensation. In the nine month period 2024, we recorded 669,937 in share based compensation expense related to our restricted
stock awards to employees and 245,023 in new stock option grants in the third quarter to employees and directors. The balance of
our operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) increased 15.6 year over year, primarily driven by intentional investments in
sales and marketing to accelerate revenue growth and investments in general and administrative to build structure in order to better
scale, as well as expanding our development team to bring product enhancements to market more swiftly. 

Below are our key financial results for the third
quarter 2024 (consolidated unless otherwise noted): 

Revenues were 4,589,625, representing revenue growth of 8.0 year over year.

 awards to employees and 245,023 related to stock option grants to employees and directors in the third quarter 2024. 

Loss from operations was 298,211, compared to income from operations of 345,555 in third quarter 2023. 

Net loss was 392,850 with basic and diluted net loss per share of

As of September 30, 2024, we had 199 employees, including 32 part-time employees, compared to 165 employees, including 29 part-time employees, as of September 30, 2023. 

Financial Impact of Current Economic Conditions 

Our overall performance depends on economic conditions,
and our continuing growth will be due in part to continued growth in the US economy and continued stability of state and local governmental
spending in the US. Our performance will also continue to be affected by uncertainty in the inflationary environment and uncertainty in
interest rates, as well as slowing-to-modest global growth rates. 

Employee wages, our largest expense, have recently
increased due to wage inflation. These increased labor costs have been mitigated by appropriately increasing customer renewal rates whenever
we have the contractual ability to do so, as well as improved margins from growth in the software as a service revenue line. We anticipate
that the inflationary effect on our wages has stabilized. 

Other volatility, particularly from global supply
chain disruptions, has had and is expected to continue to have a minimal impact on us as we consume relatively little in raw materials.
Any macroeconomic downturn could affect our customers and potential customers budgets for technology procurement. However,
absent economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our continued focus on strategic initiatives
to grow our customer base, we believe in the strength of our brand and that our focus on our strategic priorities will deliver consistent
growth. 

Uncertainties, Trends, and Risks that can cause
Fluctuations in our Operating Results 

Our operating results have fluctuated significantly
in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, in addition to economic conditions, that
are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
- Uncertainties, Trends, and Risks that can cause Fluctuations in our Operating Results of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Due to all these factors and the other risks discussed Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors 
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item IA, Risk Factors 
of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed on May 14, 2024, our past results of operations should not be relied
upon as an indication of our future performance. Comparisons of our operating results with prior periods is not necessarily meaningful
or indicative of future performance. 

Reportable Segments 

We have two reportable segments: Document Management
and Document Conversion. These reportable segments are discussed above under Company Overview.

Revenues were up for the third quarter and
nine-month period 2024 by 341,196, or 8.0 , and 1,044,610, or 8.2 , respectively, primarily driven by software as a service and
professional services in the Document Conversion segment more than offsetting weakness in storage and retrieval, which is expected
to continue in the near term, and normal volatility in sales of direct premise software. 

25 

Software as a Service Revenues 

We provide access to our software solutions as a
service, accessible through the internet. Our customers typically enter into our software as a service agreement for periods of one
year or more. Under these agreements, we generally provide access to the applicable software, data storage and related customer
assistance and support. Revenues from the sale of software as a service, which are reported as part of our Document Management
segment increased by 110,197, or 8.5 , in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 and increased by 399,591, or
10.5 in the nine-month period 2024 compared to the nine-month period 2023. This increase was primarily the result of new
cloud-based solution sales, primarily our IntelliCloud Payables Automation Solution, as well as expanded data storage, user seats,
and hosting fees for existing customers. Those growth areas were partially offset by weakness in the YellowFolder growth in K-12,
which was impacted by higher than normal churn rate in those customers. 

Professional Services Revenues 

Professional services revenues primarily consist of
revenues from document scanning and conversion services, plus consulting, discovery, training, and advisory services to assist customers
with document management needs. These revenues include arrangements that do not involve the sale of software. Of our professional services
revenues during the third quarter 2024 and nine-month period 2024, 2,456,456 and 7,457,389, respectively, were derived from our Document
Conversion operations and 143,774 and 284,877, respectively, were derived from our Document Management operations. Our overall professional
services revenues increased by 267,140, or 11.5 , in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 and increased by 811,571,
or 11.7 , in the nine-month period 2024 compared to the nine-month period 2023. This increase is the result of a significant project in our Document Conversion segment, along with realized price increases in late 2023, more than offsetting fewer projects in our Document
Management segment, which can be more volatile with its significantly smaller volumes. However, we believe that our largest Document Conversion
customer intends to renegotiate, and accordingly reduce, our pricing on a significant portion of our work for this customer, which could
have a significant adverse impact on our future professional services revenues as well as our overall revenues, margins, net income and
cash flows next year.

2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 and decreased 137,489, or 15.1 , in the nine-month period 2024 compared to the nine-month period
2023 following the reduced volume in sales of software and professional services in that segment. Our cost of revenues for our Document
Conversion segment increased by 154,253, or 11.3 , in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 and increased by 315,485,
or 8.0 , during the nine-month period 2024 compared to the nine-month period 2023 due to the staffing ramp up to accommodate more work
volume, as well as a higher cost project mix in the third quarter 2024.

Our overall gross profit decreased to 61.1 in
the third quarter 2024 from 61.3 in the third quarter 2023, and increased to 63.4 for the nine-month period 2024 from 61.8 for
the nine-month period 2023. The revenue mix between segments did not shift significantly, leading to stability in margins. Price
increases in the Document Conversion segment offset a less profitable project mix in professional services within that segment, and
margins were further bolstered by a strong performance leading to a more profitable project mix in Document Management professional
services. 

Cost of Software as a Service 

Cost of software as a service, or SaaS, consists
primarily of technical support personnel, hosting services, and related costs. Cost of software as a service during the third
quarter 2024 increased by 28,819, or 14.4 , from the third quarter 2023 and decreased by 16,625, or 2.4 , during the nine-month
period 2024 over the nine-month period 2023. While our cost to support SaaS is generally stable and consistent, in the third quarter
2024 we hired two additional personnel, a help desk support and an implementations project manager, in order to meet growing demand.
Our gross margin in the third quarter 2024 decreased to 83.7 compared to 84.5 in the third quarter 2023 and increased to 84.3 in
the nine-month period 2024 compared to 82.2 during the nine-month period 2023. 

Cost of Professional Services 

Cost of professional services consists primarily
of compensation for employees performing the document conversion services, compensation of our software engineers and implementation
consultants and related third-party costs. Cost of professional services during the third quarter 2024 increased by 92,715, or 6.9 ,
over the third quarter 2023 and increased in the nine-month period 2024 by 226,862, or 5.9 , over the nine-month period 2023, primarily
due to growing the Document Conversion staff to process the growing revenues. Our gross margins in professional services increased to
45.0 in the third quarter 2024 compared to 42.6 in the third quarter 2023 and increased to 47.6 during the nine-month period 2024
compared to 44.7 in the nine-month period 2023. Price increases in the Document Conversion segment offset a less profitable project
mix in professional services within that segment in the third quarter 2024, and was strengthened by an overall solid project mix in the
segment for the nine month period 2024. Gross margins related to professional services projects may vary widely, depending upon the nature
of the digital conversion or consulting project and the amount of labor it takes to complete a project.

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative expenses during the
third quarter 2024 increased by 597,833, or 39.4 , over the third quarter 2023, and increased in the nine-month period 2024 by
 1,635,572, or 35.3 , over the nine-month period 2023, primarily related to new share based compensation expense of 381,041 and
 914,960, respectively, attributable to awards of restricted stock and stock options during 2024. The nine-month period 2024 amount
of 914,960 of share based compensation expense for 2024 stock awards is comprised of 669,937 related to restricted stock awards to
employees and 245,023 related to stock option grants to employees and directors, as described in the following table:

Excluding the share based compensation expense,

15.0 in the nine-month period 2024 over 2023, related to investments made in order to scale, such as development, finance, and our
SOC2 process, as well as wage increases. These increases in investments were reflected in both our reportable segments. Our Document
Management segment, which includes the share based compensation expense, reported a general and administrative expenses of
 1,189,789 and 3,539,330 in the third quarter 2024 and the nine-month period 2024, respectively, from 794,177 and 2,392,023 in
the third quarter 2023 and the nine-month period 2023, respectively. In our Document Conversion segment, our general and
administrative expenses increased to 924,053 and 2,728,801, and 721,832 and 2,240,536, in the third quarter and nine-month
period 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses during the third
quarter 2024 increased by 206,211, or 41.6 , over the third quarter 2023 and increased by 206,457, or 13.2 , during the nine-month
period 2024 compared to the nine-month period 2023. The increases were primarily driven by the expansion of our sales team as part
of our investments intended to accelerate our sales. Additionally, these increases resulted from an increased focus on our marketing
efforts, such as an increase in our marketing expense on select campaigns and increased travel and trade show materials
and attendance. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization during the third quarter
2024 increased by 39,985, or 16.1 , over the third quarter 2023 and increased by 111,112, or 15.5 , during the nine-month period 2024
over the nine-month period 2023 primarily as a result of increased amortization of capitalized software costs. 

Other Items of Income and
Expense 

Interest Expense, Net 

Interest expense decreased by 41,585, or 30.5 ,
in the third quarter 2024 as compared to the third quarter 2023, and decreased by 136,385, or 29.1 during the nine-month period
2024 as compared to nine-month period 2023. The decrease resulted from reduced interest resulting from principal repayments as
follows: the 2020 Notes principal payments of 263,000 on February 28, 2023 and 717,500 on August 31, 2023, and the 2022 Notes principal
repayments of 500,000 on March 30, 2024, 325,000 on June 30, 2024 and 800,000 on August 30, 2024. The reduced interest on lower
principal balances year over year was partially offset by accelerating amortization of debt issue costs corresponding with the
prepaid notes principal. 

30 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have financed our operations primarily
through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings from third parties and related parties, and
proceeds from private sales of equity. Since 2012, we have raised a net total of approximately 22.9 million in cash through
issuances of debt and equity securities, net of 3.6 million in debt repayments. In
March, June and August 2024, we prepaid an aggregate of 1.65 million of the principal balances of the 2022 Notes,
respectively. 

In 2024 and 2023, we engaged in several actions that
significantly improved our liquidity and cash flows, including (i) effective October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, securing a renewal
contract with our largest customer, containing an estimated net rate increase for all non-fixed pricing projects of approximately 21 ,
compared to the current rates in effect for the contract period commencing June 1, 2018, and (ii) on March 13, 2024, we agreed with the
note holders to amend the Unrelated Notes and Related Notes to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2025, for the remaining 807,331
in 2022 Unrelated Notes and 532,169 of the 2022 Related Notes. However, we believe that our largest customer intends to renegotiate our
pricing on a significant portion of our work for this customer, which could have an adverse impact on our overall revenues, cash flows,
liquidity and capital resources. 

At September 30, 2024, we had 2.5 million in
cash and cash equivalents, working capital deficit of 0.2 million, and long-term debt relating to our notes payable of
approximately 1.3 million due December 31, 2025. Based on our current plans and assumptions, we believe our capital resources,
including our cash and cash equivalents, along with funds expected to be generated from our operations and potential financing
options, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow needs for at least the next 12 months, including to satisfy our
expected working capital needs and our capital and debt service commitments over that period. 

However, our future cash resources and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. For example,
from time to time we evaluate opportunities to expand our current or to develop new products and
services and technology or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, which could increase our capital needs. Our ability to
meet our capital needs in the short term will depend on many factors, including maintaining and enhancing our operating cash flow
and successfully retaining and growing our client base in the midst of continuing uncertainty regarding inflation and economic growth, the impact of contract renegotiations with our largest customer, the timing of sales, the success
of our new business partners expanding our product and service lines, the mix of products and services, unanticipated events over which
we have no control increasing our operating costs or reducing our revenues beyond our current expectations, and other factors discussed
in this Quarterly Report. 

We believe we could seek additional debt or
equity financing on acceptable terms. While we are confident in our ability to satisfy our current debt requirements, we also believe that our capital
resources, business operations and financial results would allow us to seek a full or partial refinancing or other appropriate modification
of the current notes payable, such as an extension or conversion to equity, if we deem necessary or desirable. However, our ability to
obtain additional capital, or to modify our existing debt arrangements, when needed or desired, will depend on many factors, including
general economic and market conditions, our operating performance and investor and lender sentiment, and thus cannot be assured. 

Indebtedness 

As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding long-term
indebtedness consisted of the 2022 Notes issued to accredited investors on April 1, 2022, with an aggregate outstanding principal balance
of 1,339,500 and accrued interest of 0. 

See Note 7 and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further information on the 2022 notes. 

Capital Expenditures 

There were no material commitments for capital expenditures
at September 30, 2024. 

Cash Provided by Operating
Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities during the
nine-month period 2024 was 3,652,417, primarily attributable to the net income adjusted for non-cash expenses of 2,203,699, a decrease
in operating assets of 780,011 and an increase in operating liabilities of 1,161,221. Net cash provided by operating activities during
the nine-month period 2023 was 1,128,314, primarily attributable to the net income adjusted for non-cash expenses of 1,312,276, an increase
in operating assets of 1,037,575 and an increase in operating liabilities of 395,985. 

Cash Used by Investing
Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities in the nine-month
period 2024 was 695,359, including 302,396 in capitalized software and 203,900 in servers to replace end-of-life Yellow Folder software
as a service servers. Net cash used in investing activities in the nine-month period 2023 was 432,053, including 348,051 in capitalized
software. 

31 

Cash Used in and Provided
by Financing Activities 

Net cash used by financing activities during the nine-month
period 2024 amounted to 1,625,000 in repayment of notes payable and 45,577 in the principal portion of a finance lease liability. Net
cash used by financing activities during the nine-month period 2023 amounted to 700,000 in earnout liability payments, 980,450 in repayment
of notes payable, and 23,167 in the principal portion of a finance lease liability. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We monitor and analyze
these items for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates
and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in
which they become known. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially from our estimates. To the extent there are material
differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates are
set forth in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) at the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, as of
September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving its desired objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect resource constraints
and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). 

We regularly review our internal control over financial
reporting and, from time to time, we have made changes as we deemed appropriate to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting, although these changes do not have a material effect on our overall internal control.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

None. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our business and operating results are subject to
many risks, uncertainties and other factors. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, affairs, assets, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the
risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023, except as set forth in Part II, Item IA, Risk Factors, of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed on May 14, 2024. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On August 16, 2024, we granted non-employee directors stock options to purchase 36,000 shares at an exercise price
of 8.78 per share, the fair market value of the shares on the grant date, under the 2023 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan. The
grant of options was not subject to vesting, and was made in reliance on the exemption from registration available in Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. 

On September 4, 2024, we granted employees stock options to purchase 14,500 shares at an exercise price of 10.12
per share, the fair market value of the shares on the grant date, under the 2015 Plan, with annual vesting through 2027 based on service
time. The grant of options was made in reliance on the exemption from registration available in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.
