 years and expire years from the date of grant. The exercise price of these options is . Due to the Company s lack of option exercise history on the date of grant, the expected term was calculated using the simplified method defined as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of each option. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant that most closely corresponded to the expected term of the option. The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the period of time equivalent to the expected term for each award. The dividend yield was computed as the annualized dividend rate at the grant date divided by the strike price of the stock option.

 Overview 
 Medifast is the health and wellness company known for its habit-based and coach-guided lifestyle solution OPTA VIA . As a physician-founded company with more than 40 years of history, OPTA VIA's lifestyle plans deliver clinically proven health benefits, utilizing scientifically developed products and a framework for habit creation reinforced by independent coaches and community support. The development and widespread consumer adoption of GLP-1 medications has fundamentally shifted the way many individuals think about weight management and health. In response to these developments the Company initiated its business transformation to build a set of differentiated capabilities, reflecting its commitment to providing comprehensive health and wellness solutions to customers as both their needs and the industry evolve, that are expected to position Medifast to be a force in the dynamic and changing health and wellness space. As part of this transformation, the Company entered into a collaboration with LifeMD, Inc. (Nasdaq: LFMD) LifeMD in December of 2023, and launched a significant Company-led marketing effort in May of 2024. Medifast has created a well-capitalized business that has a powerful business model, building a network of approximately 30,000 independent active earning coaches providing consistent and effective support to customers on their weight loss journeys. 
 
 In a rapidly changing health and wellness landscape, Medifast is committed to innovating and building upon its scientific and clinical heritage to deliver on its mission of offering the world Lifelong Transformation, Making a Healthy Lifestyle Second Nature . With the growing interest in medically supported weight loss and GLP-1 medications powering the emergence of an important new market for products and services to support individuals on their health and wellness journey, Medifast is transforming its business to capitalize on this opportunity. We are developing distinct OPTA VIA coach supported program offerings tailored to meet the unique needs of three specific customer segments: 
 
 Individuals using GLP-1 medications as a core element of their weight-loss program; 
 Individuals who are looking to maintain weight loss and improved health as they transition off GLP-1 medications; and 
 Individuals who have never used weight-loss medications and want to solely use healthy habits. 
 
 Through the Company s previously announced collaboration with LifeMD, OPTA VIA customers now have access to all-in-one holistic solutions, whether they are not utilizing medically supported weight loss, are currently using medical weight loss options, transitioning off medications, or looking for further support after stopping taking medications. This collaboration brings together OPTA VIA s personalized habit-based, coach-guided approach with medical expertise from board-certified affiliated LifeMD clinicians, allowing access to weight loss medications, including GLP-1 medications, when clinically appropriate. With this collaboration, the Company and LifeMD have developed an integrated offering with the goal of creating a comprehensive and seamless solution for customers who desire to use medications and OPTA VIA s lifestyle program, outlined in further detail below. In addition to lifestyle support and a simple roadmap for habit creation, the integrated offering includes scientifically developed nutritional support solutions including a GLP-1 Nutrition Support product kit designed to help mitigate certain GLP-1 medication side effects, such as muscle loss. Through LifeMD, customers also have access to a medical provider and blood work, as well as prescription and insurance support. 
 
 As the medications for weight loss continue to evolve and grow, Medifast is dedicated to maintaining a relentless focus on the development of additional support products and supplements designed to meet customer needs and to make living a healthy lifestyle second nature. 
 
 OPTA VIA s holistic lifestyle solution is built around four key components: 
 
 Independent OPTA VIA Coaches: Independent OPTA VIA coaches provide individualized support and guidance to customers on the path to optimal health and wellbeing. The coaches have impacted more than 3 million lives to date.

 Clinicians as Partners: Through the collaboration with LifeMD, OPTA VIA customers have access to LifeMD s board-certified affiliated clinicians and medication, such as GLP-1 medications when clinically appropriate, that support treatment plans for obesity and other health conditions. 
 
 Across these offerings, customers are aided in achieving their health goals through a network of OPTA VIA coaches, about 90 of whom were customers first. OPTA VIA coaches introduce customers to a set of healthy habits, in most cases starting with the habit of healthy eating, and offer exclusive OPTA VIA-branded products, including Fuelings as well as OPTA VIA ACTIVE , a line of essential amino acid supplements and protein powders. Fuelings are nutrient-dense, portion-controlled, nutritionally interchangeable, and simple to use. They are formulated with high-quality ingredients and contain BC30 probiotic cultures, which help support digestive health as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, vitamins and minerals, as well as other nutrients essential for good health. Our products are used as tools and support the process of integrating healthy habits into our customers' daily lives. 
 The OPTA VIA coaching model is customer-centric and boasts an energized health and wellness community. It promotes holistic health and wellness and positions healthy weight as a catalyst to greater lifestyle changes. OPTA VIA coaches provide personalized support to customers and motivate them by sharing their passion for healthy living and lifestyle transformation. 
 The entrepreneurial spirit of our OPTA VIA coaches is another key to our success, as they activate new customers, many of whom go on to become OPTA VIA coaches. We offer economic incentives designed to support each OPTA VIA coach s long-term success, which we believe plays an important role in their financial wellness, providing the opportunity to improve their finances while changing the health trajectory of families, communities, and generations. 1 
 OPTA VIA coaches are independent contractors, not employees, who support customers and market our products and services primarily through word of mouth, email, and social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), and video conferencing platforms. As entrepreneurs, OPTA VIA coaches market our products to friends, family, and other acquaintances. OPTA VIA products are shipped directly to customers who are working with an OPTA VIA coach. OPTA VIA coaches do not handle inventory or deliver merchandise to customers. This arrangement frees our OPTA VIA coaches from having to manage inventory and allows them to maintain an arms-length transactional relationship while focusing their attention on support and encouragement. 
 With the expansion of our business to include GLP-1 support tools, we are leveraging multiple channels to enhance customer acquisition and spur meaningful growth. Although the number of OPTA VIA coaches has recently declined, they remain a fundamental component of our business, and their outreach around our integrated wellness offering is one channel to drive customer acquisition. Additionally, we are collaborating with LifeMD to activate their patient base as another channel for us to acquire customers. Further, in May 2024, we launched a national marketing campaign designed to drive customer acquisition and elevate brand awareness. Additional information surrounding the marketing campaign can be found in the section below titled, Recent Initiatives. These new acquisition channels and investments are intended to evolve the Company s previous single-channel coach-focused business model to be one that pairs company advertising with relationship-based coaching and the ability to access weight loss medications through our collaboration with LifeMD. Collectively, we believe these initiatives will significantly broaden OPTA VIA s reach, advancing its mission to empower individuals on their own health journeys, and fuel positive outcomes and revenue streams. 
 Our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., OPTA VIA, LLC, Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC, Seven Crondall Associates, LLC, Corporate Events, Inc., OPTA VIA (Hong Kong) Limited, OPTA VIA (Singapore) PTE. LTD, and OPTA VIA Health Consultation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Competition 
 Geo-political concerns and certain economic challenges including the impact of inflationary pressures have caused macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility in markets where we, our suppliers and our OPTA VIA coaches operate. 
 We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity or other raw material prices. Inflation could impact our cost structure and put pressure on consumer spending. Increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial

 condition, or results of operations. Our variable cost structure can be utilized to adapt to changing market conditions with potential actions including adjustments to our manufacturing, distribution, and customer support infrastructure. 
 
 In response to worsening macroeconomic conditions, the Company may take further actions that alter its business operations that Management determines to be in the best interests of the Company s employees, OPTA VIA coaches, and customers, such as evaluating our operational footprint or taking incremental pricing actions to offset supply chain costs and inflationary pressures. 
 
 The weight loss industry is very competitive and encompasses a diverse array of weight loss products and programs. These include a wide variety of commercial weight loss programs, medical weight-loss solutions, other pharmaceutical products, surgical interventions, books, self-help diets, dietary meal replacements, and appetite suppressants as well as digital tools, app-based health and wellness monitoring solutions, and wearable trackers. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight have many options and can turn to online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting, traditional center-based competitors, and self-administered products such as prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and supplements as well as medically supervised programs. 
 
 Beginning in Q3 2022, we began to see a downward trend in the number of active earning OPTA VIA coaches, driven by a decline in customers and attributable to changing social media algorithms and inflationary pressures on consumer spending. Additionally, the trend s downward decline became sharper beginning in Q2 2023 due to the increased prevalence and adoption of GLP-1 medications and increased pressures on customer acquisition. We believe that, with continued pressures on customer acquisition, this downward trend in the number of active earning coaches will continue in the short-term. 
 
 Medical weight loss solutions, such as GLP-1 medications, have become an increasingly key component of the overall health and wellness ecosystem, and the recent surging awareness and popularity of these weight loss medications serves as another major competing factor, as these products have prompted a huge change in the way that consumers think about weight loss and lifestyle modification solutions in general. We recognize that these weight loss medications have attracted significant attention from the market and pose a threat to our interactions with our customer base. Importantly, the efficacy claims of GLP-1 medications for weight loss are based specifically on their incorporation with lifestyle changes, such as through a structured program like OPTA VIA, that include a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. As a result, under Medifast s offering, access to weight loss medications becomes one important element in an overall tailored lifestyle plan that also includes coaching, community support, nutritionally balanced meals, and exercise. 
 
 Our research shows that most of those who are interested in weight loss medications are also looking for support beyond a prescription, including clarity on how to incorporate healthy eating and exercise into their lifestyles while using these medical solutions. While medically supported weight loss can be effective, long-term success is dependent on nutrition and lifestyle changes. 
 
 We believe our scientific and clinical heritage combined with our commitment to evaluating programs, plans and products through clinical research are primary differentiators that allow us to compete in these markets. Our scientifically designed products were originally developed by a physician, and we have continued the development of nutrition and weight-management products since our founding. 
 
 These macroeconomic uncertainties and increasing adoption of medical weight loss solutions make it challenging for our management to estimate our future business performance. However, we intend to continue to actively monitor the impact of these developments on our business and will update our practices accordingly. Medifast has perfected our model over the last 40 plus years, with habits, coaches, and community at the core, and we will continue to innovate as the industry evolves. 
 
 Recent Initiatives 
 
 In response to the current competitive landscape, in which acquiring customers has become more difficult due to competitive pressures from GLP-1 medications being sought after by our potential customers, the Company is focusing on a number of initiatives to aid in increasing revenue and profit growth in the years ahead. At the core of the Company s transformation is its desire to grow its business by broadening its customer base through increased brand visibility and recognition, and by significantly expanding its total addressable market. 
 
 Areas of investment include executing our new marketing campaign as well as cultivating new customers through the Company s collaboration with LifeMD. Through an expected investment of approximately 20 to 25 million in Company-led marketing efforts in 2024, we are committed to driving growth and enhancing brand visibility while highlighting our holistic

 offer. We are trialing and adjusting our activities to maximize breakthrough, and are optimizing spending dependent on whether we expect to see a positive return on incremental expenditures. This high-profile national campaign aims to elevate OPTA VIA brand awareness, foster engagement and drive customer conversion. With a multi-phase, omnichannel approach, the campaign is introducing new consumer and coach-facing branding and visuals, and elevate the website, social and digital experience. The Company incurred approximately 16.4 million in advertising expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We plan to continue our investment through the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, and form the foundation of the Company s strategy to return to growth, broadening and deepening our acquisition channels. This aligns with our three strategic growth pillars robust marketing initiatives, coaching network expansion and strategic collaboration with LifeMD to empower individuals on their journey to optimal health and wellbeing. 
 
 We believe by significantly broadening our customer acquisition activities, through launching our new marketing campaign, upgrading customers' digital experience, and leaning into the medically supported weight loss market through our collaboration with LifeMD, we will be positioned for future success. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes in our critical estimates or policies during the first nine months of 2024.

 Revenue: Revenue decreased 95.7 million, or 40.6 , to 140.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 235.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of active earning OPTA VIA coaches to 30,000 as of September 30, 2024, a 36.3 decrease from 47,100 as of September 30, 2023 and the decline in the productivity per active earning OPTA VIA coach. Revenue decreased 397.6 million, or 45.1 , to 483.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 881.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a decrease in the number of active earning OPTA VIA coaches, the decline in productivity per active earnings OPTA VIA coach, and a 9.1 million impact from a timing difference related to changes in the Company s sales order terms and conditions with its customers realized in the first quarter of 2023. The average revenue per active earning OPTA VIA coach was 4,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 6.7 decrease compared to 5,008 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in productivity per active earning OPTA VIA coach for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by continued pressure on customer acquisition. 
 Cost of sales: Cost of sales decreased 24.0 million, or 41.0 , to 34.5 million from 58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by decreased volumes. Cost of sales decreased 119.5 million, or 48.5 , to 127.1 million from 246.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by approximately 105.8 million attributable to decreased volumes and 10.6 million in efficiencies in inventory management. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted cost of sales were 34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 24.0 million, or 41.0 , as compared to 58.5 million from the corresponding period in 2023.

The decrease in gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased 20 basis points to 75.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 75.2 for the corresponding period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased 278.1 million, or 43.8 , to 356.4 million from 634.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased 170 basis points to 73.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 72.0 for the corresponding period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was positively impacted by efficiencies in inventory management. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was equal to GAAP gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was 359.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 275.5 million, or 43.4 , as compared to 634.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023.

 Selling, general, and administrative SG A ): SG A expenses were 103.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 48.3 million, or 31.8 , as compared to 151.9 million from the corresponding period in 2023. SG A expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 38.2 million decrease in OPTA VIA coach compensation on fewer active earning coaches and lower volumes and 5.0 million of reduced costs for coach-related events, including the annual OPTA VIA convention. As a percentage of revenue, SG A expenses were 73.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 64.4 for the corresponding period in 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting approximately 590 basis points of costs for our Company-led customer acquisition initiative and 340 basis points attributable to the loss of leverage on fixed costs due to lower sales volumes. Customer-led customer acquisition initiatives are included within the Advertising Expense caption of Footnote 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. SG A expenses included research and development costs of 1.1 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the development of new products and plans, and clinical research activities. SG A expenses were 354.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 162.5 million, or 31.5 , as compared to 516.8 million from the corresponding period in 2023. SG A expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an approximately 161.2 million decrease in OPTA VIA coach compensation on fewer active earning coaches and lower volumes and an 8.2 million decrease in credit card fees, partially offset by 16.4 million of Company-led customer acquisition initiatives and 12.5 million of supply chain optimization costs. As a percentage of revenue, SG A expenses were 73.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 58.7 for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily reflecting approximately 340 basis points of loss of leverage on fixed costs due to lower sales volumes, 340 basis points of costs incurred for our Company-led customer acquisition initiatives, and 260 basis points for supply chain optimization costs. SG A expenses included research and development costs of 3.3 million and 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the development of new products and plans, and clinical research activities. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted SG A expenses were 101.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 50.0 million, or 32.9 , as compared to 151.9 million from the corresponding period in 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted SG A expenses were 333.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 183.0 million, or 35.4 , as compared to 516.8 million from the corresponding period in 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted SG A excludes expenses related to the Company s supply chain optimization costs, costs to exit hotel commitments for the Company s annual OPTA VIA convention in future years, reflecting a change in strategy, and costs for the collaboration with LifeMD. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 Income from operations: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s income from operations was 2.1 million, a 23.4 million decrease from the 25.5 million income from operations for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a result of decreased gross profit partially offset by decreased SG A expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company s income from operations as a percentage of revenue was 1.5 as compared to the Company s income from operations as a percentage of revenue of 10.8 for the corresponding period in 2023, due to the factors described above impacting SG A expenses, partially offset by the factors impacting gross profit. For the nine months ended September 30,

Table of Contents 

 2024, income from operations decreased 115.6 million to less than 2.2 million from 117.7 million for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a result of the factors described above impacting SG A expenses, partially offset by the factors impacting gross profit. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to less than 0.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.4 for the corresponding period in 2023 due to the factors above impacting SG A expenses, partially offset by the factors impacting gross profit. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted income from operations was 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 21.8 million, or 85.3 , as compared to 25.5 million from the corresponding period in 2023.

 Provision for income taxes: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.4 million in income tax expense, an effective tax rate of 28.5 , as compared to 3.4 million, an effective tax rate of 12.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax benefit for donations of inventory compared to 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 1.2 million in income tax expense, an effective tax rate of 48.6 , as compared to 25.6 million, an effective tax rate of 21.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the impact of the tax shortfall for stock compensation, which was magnified by the near break-even pre-tax income position in the current year. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted income tax provision was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an effective tax rate of 26.0 as compared to 12.9 for the corresponding period in 2023.

The period-over-period changes were driven by the factors described above. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted net income was 3.9 million or 0.35 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.12 per diluted share for the corresponding period in 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company had stockholders equity of 207.3 million and working capital of 152.6 million at September 30, 2024 as compared with 201.5 million and 131.7 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The 5.9 million net increase in stockholders equity was primarily driven by a 5.2 million increase in share-based compensation and 1.1 million of net income for the period, partially offset by 0.8 million in net shares repurchased for employee taxes. The Company s cash, cash equivalents and investment securities increased from 150.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 170.0 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 107.7 million to 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 137.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a 73.3 million decrease in net income excluding non-cash charges, a 46.1 million decrease related to a smaller inventory reduction in the period ending September 30, 2024 to align with sales demand, and a 4.0 million decrease resulting from lower prepaid

 expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a 11.6 million increase resulting from a smaller reduction in accounts payable and accrued expen ses during the p eriod, and a 4.6 million increase resulting from lower other assets. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 50.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by investments purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting in a 42.9 million decrease of net purchases of investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 60.4 million to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 61.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 54.3 million decrease in cash dividends paid to stockholders, a 3.6 million decrease in stock repurchases, and a 2.5 million decrease in net shares repurchased for employee taxes. 
 In pursuing its business strategy, the Company may require additional cash for operating and investing activities. The Company expects future cash requirements in both the short term and the long term, if any, to be funded from operating cash flow and financing activities. 
 The Company is currently investing in new growth initiatives which have the potential to impact liquidity in future periods. The Company s current growth initiatives, which are primarily comprised of Company-led customer acquisition, new product development and the Company s Medically Support Weight Loss collaboration with LifeMD, do not require any material contractual commitments or capital expenditures in future periods. Since the future costs of these endeavors are variable in nature and will be scaled at the discretion of management, we do not believe there is any significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. 
 From time to time, the Company evaluates potential acquisitions that complement our business. If consummated, any such transactions may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity or debt. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions. 
 On April 13, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors entered into a credit agreement among the Company, the Guarantors, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., in its capacity as administrative agent. On May 31, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the borrowing capacity and convert the interest rate to be based on SOFR, from LIBOR (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a 225.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a 20.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility that permits the Company, subject to certain conditions, to increase the senior secured revolving credit facility by up to 100.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings under the credit facility and was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 
 On October 30, 2024, the Company terminated its Amended Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A. The Company had no borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, inclusive of the credit facility and letter of credit sublimit, between September 30, 2024, and the termination date. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and a decline in the stock market. The Company does not enter into derivatives, foreign exchange transactions or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and market pricing impacting our credit facility and investment in money market securities, government and agency securities, and corporate bonds. Other than for strategic investments, its current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting of corporate bonds and U.S. money market securities directly or through managed funds. Its cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in North America. Its marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and market pricing risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase or if market pricing decreases. If market interest rates were to increase and market pricing were to decrease immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels at September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that the fair value of its investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount and therefore it would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market conditions on our investments. Additionally, the Company is exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in equity markets related to its investment in

 LifeMD common stock, purchased in December of 2023. If equity prices were to decrease immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels at September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that the fair value of the Company investment would decline by an immaterial amount and therefore it would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected by any significant degree by the effect of a change in market conditions on our investment. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposure since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Act, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and on a timely basis. Based on this evaluation performed in accordance with the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
