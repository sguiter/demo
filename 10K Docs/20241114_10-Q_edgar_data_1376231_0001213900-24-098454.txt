Amendment
to Partnership Agreement 

On
January 23, 2020, the Company executed the Second Amendment (the Second Amendment to Limited Partnership Agreement (the
 Agreement in order to create a new class of Company securities titled Class A preferred units. 

Pursuant
to Section 5.6 of the Agreement, Soleil Capital Management LLC, the Company s general partner (the General Partner may, without the approval of the Company s limited partners, issue additional Company securities for any Company purpose at any
time and from time to time for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall determine in its sole
discretion, all without the approval of any limited partners, and that each additional Company interest authorized to be issued by the
Company may be issued in one or more classes, or one of more series of any such classes, with such designations, preferences, rights,
powers and duties as shall be fixed by the General Partner in its sole discretion. Pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Agreement, the General
Partner may, without the approval of any partner, any unitholder or any other person, amend any provision of the Agreement to reflect
any amendment expressly permitted in the Agreement to be made by the General Partner acting along, therefore including the creation of
a new class of Company securities. 

The
designation, powers, preferences and rights of the Class A preferred units and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof
are contained in the Second Amendment, and are summarized as follows: 

Number
and Stated Value. The number of authorized Class A preferred units is . Each Class A preferred unit will have a stated
value of (the Stated Value ). 

Rights. Except
as set forth in the Second Amendment, each Class A preferred unit has all of the rights, preferences and obligations of the Company s
common units as set forth in the Agreement and shall be treated as a common unit for all other purposes of the Agreement.

per annum on the Stated Value., which shall accrue
on a monthly basis at the rate of per month, non-compounding, and shall be payable in cash within 30 days of each calendar year
for which the dividend is payable. 

Liquidation .
In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, a merger or consolidation of the Company wherein the Company
is not the surviving entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, each Class A unit will be entitled to
receive, prior an in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Company to the holders of common units
or any other Company securities ranking junior to the Class A preferred units, or to the General Partner, an amount per Class A preferred
unit equal to any accrued but unpaid dividends. If, upon such an event and after the payment of preferential amounts required to be paid
to holders of any Company securities having a ranking upon liquidation senior to the Class A preferred units, the assets of the Company
available for distribution to the partners of the Company are insufficient to provide for both the payment of the full Class A liquidation
preference and the preferential amounts (if any) required to be paid to holders of any other Company securities having a ranking upon
liquidation pari passu with the Class A preferred units, such assets as are so available shall be distributed among
the Class A preferred units and the holders of any other series of Company securities having a ranking upon liquidation pari

held into fully paid and nonassessable Company common units. 

Conversion
Price . Each Class A preferred unit is convertible into a number of common units equal to (x) the Stated Value plus any accrued and
unpaid dividends, divided by (y) the Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined). The Conversion Price means multiplied
by the VWAP (as defined in the Second Amendment), representing a discount rate of . 

Conversion
Limitation . In no event shall a holder of Class A preferred units be entitled to convert any of the Class A preferred units in excess
of that number of Class A preferred units upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of common units beneficially owned by such
holder and its affiliates (other than common units which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted Class
A preferred units or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein), and (2) the number of common units issuable upon the conversion of all Class
A preferred units held by such holder would result in beneficial ownership by the holder and its affiliates of more than of the
outstanding common units.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Our
revenues from product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,326,199 and 805,185 respectively. Royalty
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 116,764 and 2,735,224, respectively. The decrease in total revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the initial fee from the royalty
agreement entered into in March 2023, which was still being amortized during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease
was partially offset by an increase in product sales from expanded operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

20 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,008,960 and 569,508, respectively. Gross margins decreased
to 30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 84 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decline was
primarily due to a significant decrease in royalty revenue, which has minimal corresponding impact on cost of sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 858,221 as compared to 533,700 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily
attributed to higher marketing, payroll, and professional fees as the company continues to expand. Additionally, the company issued 2,942,771
units, resulting in unit-based compensation of 247,193 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no unit-based compensation
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income 

Net
other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 272,666 compared to net other income of 514,015 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,
was primarily due to decrease in settlement income and increased interest expenses as loans are being paid off and also includes 212,050
of estimated interest and penalties related to unpaid taxes. 

Income
Tax 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the company had a provision for income taxes expense of 15,332. The company did not have
a provision for income taxes for the same three-month period ending September 30, 2023, as it had a history of losses to income. 

Net Income
(Loss) 

As
a result of the factors mentioned above, net income decreased by 3,118,100 from 2,951,216 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, to (166,884), for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 609,765 and 3,489,615, respectively. The decrease in total revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the initial fee from the royalty
agreement entered into in March 2023, which was still being amortized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as a large
distribution sales order in the first quarter of 2023. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,368,527 and 3,941,293, respectively. Gross margins decreased
to 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decline was primarily
due to a significant decrease in royalty revenue, which has minimal corresponding impact on cost of sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,185,852 as compared to 1,391,264 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,
was primarily attributed to higher marketing, payroll, and professional fees as the company continues to increase its operations. Additionally,
the company issued 2,942,771units, resulting in unit-based compensation of 247,193 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There

ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,
was primarily due to higher settlement payments received. This increase was partially offset by higher interest expenses as loans are
being paid off and also includes 212,050 estimated interest and penalties related to unpaid taxes. 

Income
Tax 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company had a provision for income taxes expense of 144,039. The company did not have

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total assets of 3,328,550 and 3,191,246, respectively. Assets primarily consist of
the cash accounts held by the Company, inventory, vendor deposits, accounts receivable, royalty receivable and a right-to-use asset.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024. the Company s cash decreased by 243,661 accounts receivable increased by 251,769,

by 3,940, while the tax liability decreased by 71,413.

Availability
of Additional Funds 

Our
capital requirements going forward will consist of financing our operations until we are able to reach a level of revenues and gross
margins adequate to equal or exceed our ongoing operating expenses. We do not have any credit agreement or source of liquidity immediately
available to us. 

Since
inception, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financing. At September 30, 2024, we had 
1,523,599 of cash on hand. Although we believe that we have access to capital resources, there are no commitments in place for new financing
as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all. We expect to have ongoing needs for working capital in order to (a) fund operations; plus (b) fund strategic
acquisitions. To that end, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. However, there can be no assurance
that we will be successful in securing additional capital. If we are unsuccessful, we may need to (a) initiate cost reductions; (b) forego
business development opportunities; (c) seek extensions of time to fund its liabilities, or (d) seek protection from creditors. 

In
addition, if we are unable to generate adequate cash from operations, and if we are unable to find sources of funding, it may be necessary
for us to sell all or a portion of our assets, enter into a business combination, or reduce or eliminate operations. These possibilities,
to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our unitholders or that result in our unitholders losing
all of their investment in our Company. 

If
we are able to raise additional capital, we do not know what the terms of any such capital raising would be. In addition, any future
sale of our equity securities would dilute the ownership and control of your units and could be at prices substantially below prices
at which our units currently trade. Our inability to raise capital could require us to significantly curtail or terminate our operations.
We may seek to increase our cash reserves through the sale of additional equity or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities
or additional equity securities could result in additional and potentially substantial dilution to our unitholders. The incurrence of
indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict
our operations and liquidity. In addition, our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties. 

Our
unaudited condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate our continuation
as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.
The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in notes accompanying the financial statements.
The preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information
available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates.
Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements apply critical accounting policies described
in the notes to our financial statements. 

We
consider our recognition of revenues, accounting for intangible assets and related impairment analyses, the allowance for doubtful accounts
and accounting for equity transactions, to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our
financial statements. 

Together
with our critical accounting policies set out below, our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our unaudited condensed
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

24 

Basis
of Presentation 

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with instructions for
Form 10-Q, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) which we considered as necessary for a fair presentation
of the results for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP have been condensed
or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or the full year. 

Use
of Estimates 

GAAP
requires the Company to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, cash flows
and the related footnote disclosures during the period. On an on-going basis, the Company reviews and evaluates its estimates and assumptions.
Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Financial
Condition 

As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company generated cash flows from operations of 249,303 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and had positive working capital of 1,166,456 and had cash of 1,523,599 as of September 30, 2024. These factors serve
to mitigate the conditions that historically raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company believes that the Company has sufficient cash and positive cash flows to meet its obligations for a minimum of twelve months
from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 

Cash 

Cash
is carried at cost and represents cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. The Company had no cash equivalents
on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s cash is held at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC limit. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on its invested
cash. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 702,902 and 947,184, respectively, of
cash in excess of FDIC limits of 250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds above the FDIC limit could have a
significant adverse impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Accounts
Receivable and Royalty Receivable 

The
Company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . This
ASU sets forth a current expected credit loss model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments
held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. An allowance for
credit losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings. This evaluation
is inherently subjective and requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for expected credit loss of 25,419 and 10,925, respectively. 

25 

Inventory 

Inventory
consisting of finished products is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates
its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in
relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories
is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories
to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the
respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts
that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels,
product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company s estimates and expectations. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the provision for potential inventory obsolescence was 29,979 and 0, respectively. 

Leases 

The
Company applied the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842) to arrangements
with lease terms of 12 months or more. Operating lease right of use assets ROU represents the right to use the leased
asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments
over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company use an incremental borrowing rate
based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum
lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the
statements of operations. 

The
Company has an operating lease principally for warehouse and office space. Management evaluates each lease independently to determine
the purpose, necessity to its future operations in addition to other appropriate facts and circumstances. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue when the risk gets transferred to the customer which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of
promised goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s)
with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance
obligation. 

Revenues
from product sales are recognized when the risk got transferred to the customer which occurred at a point in time, typically upon shipment
of promised goods to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected
amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Royalty
revenues consist of license and sublicense agreements to use the Company s intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based
royalty. Royalty revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied by licensees and sublicensees through sales
of licensed products. 

The
Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of satisfaction of performance obligations by
licensees and sublicensees. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received cash payments totaling 3,000,000 for the prepayment
of royalties pursuant to a license agreement executed on January 2, 2023. The license agreement provides for monthly royalties to the
Company totaling 5 of gross sales of licensed products by licensee and provides the licensee exclusive use of certain trademark and
patent assets for an initial term of six months commencing March 2023 and expiring in September 2023. The Company recognized the prepaid
royalties over the initial term of exclusivity. The license agreement required a monthly minimum royalty payments of 500,000 to maintain
exclusivity on a month-to-month basis beyond September 2023. The minimum royalty payments were not met, so the agreement continued on
a non-exclusive basis, with monthly royalties to the Company totaling 5 of gross sales of licensed products by the licensee and 
provides the licensee with non-exclusive use of certain trademark and patent assets. 

26 

The
sublicense agreement executed in March 2023 provided for monthly royalties to the Company totaling 5 of gross sales of licensed products
by sublicensee and provides the sublicensee exclusive use of certain trademark and patent assets in exchange for minimum monthly royalty
payments totaling 250,000 beginning June 2023. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the sublicensee, licensee, and Company agreed that the Company would not require the minimum monthly
royalty payments. Instead, sublicensee would continue to pay 5 of gross sales as royalty, and the licensee would match this royalty
payment if their calculated royalty would have been less than what the sublicensee paid. The Company recognizes sublicense royalty revenue
on the basis of royalty statements for the period. 

Voluntary
Recall 

In
February 2024, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of approximately 62,200 lighters due to a missing child safety feature. Under
ASC 606, these products are not eligible for revenue recognition, as revenue cannot be recognized for amounts that are not expected to
be entitled. Consequently, the Company recorded this as a refund liability. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the total impact of
the recall, amounting to 198,068, has been recognized against revenues and receivables for potential credits associated with the recalled
products. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 473 was refunded to retail consumers in cash, and 79,670 in credits was issued to wholesale
and distributor customers. Only 3,467 of the credits were utilized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the remaining unutilized
credits are still included in the refund liability. The Company anticipates issuing refunds related to the recall throughout the year
and will continue to evaluate potential losses. 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the refund liability was 182,545 and 186,485, respectively. 

The
following table provides information about accounts receivable, royalty receivable from contracts with customers and the refund
liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Unit-Based
Compensation 

The
Company may issue restricted units to consultants for various services. Costs for these transactions will be measured at the fair value
of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of
the common stock is to be measured at the earlier of: (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to
earn the equity instruments is reached, or (ii) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. The Company may issue
units as compensation in future periods for services associated with the registration of the common units. 

Unit-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements
based on their fair value, in accordance with ASC Topic 718. This expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required
to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (typically the vesting period). 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 247,193 in unit-based compensation for the issuance of 2,942,771
common units to three employees, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer in exchange for services provided.
The expense was recognized at the grant date as the units were fully vested and issued as additional compensation for services already
performed. 

27 

Convertible
Instruments 

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments in accordance with ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts
in an Entity s Own Equity. This update significantly simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating
the requirement to bifurcate embedded conversion options from their host instruments, unless the conversion feature independently meets
the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Under ASC 815, a conversion feature is treated as a
derivative only if its economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, and other
specific conditions are met. 

When
it is determined that the embedded conversion options do not require bifurcation, the entire convertible instrument is accounted for
as a single liability at amortized cost. Discounts or premiums on convertible instruments are recognized based on the difference between
the proceeds received and the principal amount and are amortized over the life of the instrument using the effective interest method. 

In
the rare instances where a conversion option is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative, the Company would apply the general extinguishment
standards. The debt and equity linked derivatives are removed at their carrying amounts and the units issued are measured at their then-current
fair value, with any difference recorded as a gain or loss on extinguishment of the two separate accounting liabilities. 

Fair
Value 

The
carrying values of the Company s notes payables, convertible notes, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their
fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Unit 

The
Company computes net income per unit in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by
dividing net income/(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury
stock method, and convertible notes, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their
effect is anti-dilutive. 

For
the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2023, 5,890,170 units underlying convertible debt were dilutive and were included
in the earnings per share calculation. 

For
the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024, 1,864,780 units underlying convertible debt were antidilutive and excluded
from the dilutive earnings per share calculation. 

The
following summarizes the calculation of basic and diluted income per unit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and

Provision
for Income Taxes 

The
Company has recorded income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. This standard necessitates the recognition
of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases. 

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Certain recognition thresholds must be
met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions
that meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. The Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that would require either recognition or disclosure in the accompanying unaudited financial statements. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had minimal net income and a history of losses, and did not anticipate
having a tax liability, so no provision for income tax was recorded. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made tax payments totaling 215,452. The Company recorded provisions
for income tax expense of 15,332 and 144,039 were recorded for the three and nine month periods, respectively 

The
Company s tax liability decreased from 879,803 as of December 31, 2023, to 808,390 as of September 30, 2024, primarily due to
the impact of these provisions and payments. 

The
Company s 2023 tax return included the use of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards to reduce taxable income. Due to uncertainty
regarding the acceptance of these NOLs and the judgment that the NOLs do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold of
acceptance, the Company has recorded an estimated liability of 212,050 for potential penalties and interest associated with a possible
disallowance of these NOLs. This amount has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and classified as interest expense
on the Statement of Operations. 

The
items accounting for the difference between income taxes at the effective Federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 

Three Months

The
Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income
tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the three and nine months September 30, 2024
was higher compared to the period in 2023 because the Company had losses to offset income, which were fully utilized during 2023.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s
accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for
which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not
be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow when implemented. 

In
November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting
Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This update
aims to enhance transparency for users of financial statements by requiring public business entities to disaggregate specific expense
categories. The update mandates disclosures in the notes to financial statements, detailing the composition and trends of key expense
categories within major income statement captions. These enhanced disclosures are expected to help investors more effectively assess
the entity s performance, understand its cost structure, and make more accurate forecasts of future cash flows. ASU 2024-03 is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2024-03 on its financial reporting and disclosures. 

On March 21, 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-01 ("ASU
2024-01"), which clarifies how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is (1) within the scope of ASC 718
or (2) not a share-based payment arrangement and therefore within the scope of other guidance. The guidance in ASU 2024-01 applies
to all entities that issue profits interest awards as compensation to employees or nonemployees in exchange for goods or services. ASU
2024-01 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods
within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-01 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This guidance enhances the transparency
and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. More specifically, the amendments relate to the income tax rate reconciliation and
income taxes paid disclosures and require 1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation
and 2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt- Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 47020) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 81540): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ,
which is intended to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including
convertible instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. The guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption or
modified retrospective adoption. The guidance became effective for the Company as of January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did
not have a material impact on our financial statements, as our existing convertible instruments issued prior to January 1, 2024, did
not have bifurcated conversion features and were past due by the effective date. Future issuances of convertible instruments will comply
with the new standard, which may simplify both measurement and disclosure of these instruments.

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed
and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such review
and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure,
because of a continued material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 

The
Company did not maintain an effective financial reporting process to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. Specifically, our process lacked timely and complete financial statement reviews and procedures
to ensure all required disclosures were made in our financial statements. Also, the Company lacked documented procedures including documentation
related to testing of internal controls and entity-level controls, disclosure review, and other analytics. Furthermore, the Company lacked
sufficient personnel to properly segregate duties. 

A
material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention by
those responsible for oversight of the Company s financial reporting. 

Remedial
Efforts Related to the Material Weakness in Internal Control 

In
an effort to address the material weakness, we have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, the following remedial steps: 

We intend to establish
 an audit committee of the board of directors as soon as practicable. We envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible
 for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors, evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls. 

We intend to establish
 an internal audit function and engage a public accounting firm to perform internal audit services under an outsourcing arrangement.
 We intend for the internal audit service provider to review the policies, procedures and systems to address the material weakness. 

In addition to supervising
 all financial aspects of the Company, our Chief Financial Officer is also supervising our Information Technology IT functions to better facilitate the coordination and development of improved systems to support our financial reporting process. 

In furtherance of timely
 and complete financial statement reviews and procedures to ensure all required disclosures are made in our financial statements and
 promoting the segregation of duties, we have (i) hired experienced accounting personnel and expect to hire additional experienced
 accounting personnel, (ii) hired staff to handle the increased workload associated with the reporting structure in place and continue
 to recruit additional staff in key areas including financial reporting and tax accounting as well as we have engaged temporary staff
 and (iii) hired consultants to assist in achieving accurate and timely reporting, including hiring additional consultants to assist
 in the development and enhancement of IT infrastructure systems to support accounting. 

31 

We have provided and will
 continue to provide training to our finance and accounting personnel for timely and accurate preparation and management review of
 documentation to support our financial reporting and period-end close procedures including documentation related to testing of internal
 controls and entity-level controls, disclosure review, and other analytics. 

We have been conducting
 and continue to conduct the assessment and review of our accounting general ledger system to further identify changes that can be
 made to improve our overall control environment with respect to journal entries. We are continuing to implement more formal procedures
 related to the review and approval of journal entries. 

We have been formalizing
 the periodic account reconciliation process for all significant balance sheet accounts. We are continuing to implement more formal
 review of these reconciliations by our accounting management and we will increase the number of supervisory personnel to ensure that
 reviews are performed. 

We
believe these additional internal controls will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above; however, we may determine
to modify the remediation plan described above by adding remedial steps to or modifying or no longer pursuing (if determined to be unnecessary
in remediating the material weakness) the remedial steps set forth above. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented,
the material weakness described above will continue to exist. Notwithstanding, through the use of external consultants and the review
process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

The
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However,
the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
