 Contractual maturities of the Company s mortgage-backed securities generally exceed ; however, the effective lives may be significantly shorter due to prepayments of the underlying loans and due to the nature of these securities. There were gross realized gains or losses from sales of investment securities for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Management has assessed the securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and determined that it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of its securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its impaired securities before recovery of their amortized cost. Management believes the decline in fair value is primarily related to market interest rate fluctuations and not to the credit deterioration of the individual issuers. As a result, the Company does not hold an allowance for credit losses relating to securities. The Company holds no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A residential mortgages or commercial mortgages and also does not hold any trust-preferred securities. The creditworthiness of the Company s portfolio is largely reliant on the ability of U.S. government agencies such as Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ), Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), and municipalities throughout New York State to meet their obligations. In addition, dysfunctional markets could materially alter the liquidity, interest rate, and pricing risk of the portfolio. The stable past performance is not a guarantee for similar performance going forward.

 Allowance for Credit Losses ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value at the amount that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the asset. In determining the allowance for credit losses, accruing loans with similar risk characteristics are generally evaluated collectively. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models considering relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and to determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The models have been statistically developed based on historical correlations of credit losses with prevailing economic metrics, including unemployment and gross domestic product. The Company utilizes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year. Subsequent to this forecast period the Company reverts, on a straight-line basis over a one-year period, to historical loss experience to inform its estimate of losses for the remaining contractual life of each portfolio. Model forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations of biases that have been identified through independent validation and back-testing of model performance to actual realized results. The Company also considered the impact of qualitative factors, including portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, imprecision in its economic forecasts, geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence its loss estimation process. The Company also estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and includes all loans on nonaccrual status. The amounts of individually analyzed losses are determined through a loan-by-loan analysis. Such loss estimates are typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay. To the extent that those loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based on recent estimations of the fair value of the loan s collateral. In those cases where current appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent declines in values as determined by line of business and/or loan workout personnel. Those adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the Company s credit risk personnel. Accordingly, for real estate collateral securing larger nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, estimated collateral values are based

 Securities available for sale Fair values for available for sale securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers. The Company utilizes a third-party for these pricing services. The third-party utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the third-party service provider s evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, our third-party pricing service provider uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The models and the process take into account market convention. For each asset class, a team of evaluators gathers information from market sources and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models. The third-party, at times, may determine that it does not have sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security. In these cases the Company will utilize valuations from another pricing service. On a quarterly basis the Company reviews changes, as submitted by our third-party pricing service provider, in the market value of its securities portfolio. Individual changes in valuations are reviewed for consistency with general interest rate movements and any known credit concerns for specific securities. Additionally, on a quarterly basis the Company has its entire securities portfolio priced by a second pricing service to determine consistency with another market evaluator. If, on the Company s review or in comparing with another servicer, a material difference between pricing evaluations were to exist, the Company may submit an inquiry to our third-party pricing service provider regarding the data used to value a particular security. If the Company determines it has market information that would support a different valuation than our third-party service provider s evaluation it can submit a challenge for a change to that security s valuation. Securities available for sale are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation provided by the third-party provider uses observable market data.

The Bank s credit policies and procedures for credit commitments and financial guarantees are the same as those for extensions of credit that are recorded on the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because they may expire without being drawn upon, they do not necessarily represent cash requirements of the Bank. The Bank did t incur any losses on its commitments during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023.

These forward-looking statements are based largely on the expectations of the Company s management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: our proposed merger with NBT Bancorp Inc. NBT ), which may not be consummated or may take longer or be more expensive to accomplish than expected, and which may divert our resources and management s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; adverse changes in general economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company s market areas; increased competition among depository or other financial institutions; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment which affect the Company s margins or the fair value of financial instruments; the cost and availability of funds; changes in laws or government regulations affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, monetary policy, and capital requirements; the Company s ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; the Company s ability to successfully integrate acquired entities; credit losses in excess of the Company s allowance for credit losses; changes in accounting pronouncements and practices, as adopted by financial institution regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; the impact of such changes in accounting pronouncements and practices being greater than anticipated; the ability to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets; changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; changes in the Company s organization, compensation and benefit plans; and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as in the Company s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), in particular the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Many of these factors are beyond the Company s control and are difficult to predict. Because of these and other uncertainties, the Company s actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information, whether as a result of new, updated information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that follows includes comparisons of the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 as well as the trailing quarter ended June 30, 2024. Financial information for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024 can be found in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on October 30, 2023, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024, respectively. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments, and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other Notes to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are presented in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and how those values are determined. The more significant areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates includes the allowance for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL on loans is management s estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans carried at amortized cost. The ACL on loans is established through a provision for credit losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the ACL on loans is reduced by charge-offs on loans and increased by recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. At September 30, 2024 the ACL on loans totaled 23.1 million, compared to 21.8 million at September 30, 2023. A significant portion of our ACL is allocated to the commercial portfolio (both commercial real estate and commercial and industrial C I loans). As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the ACL allocated to the total commercial portfolio was 18.9 million, 17.8 million and 17.9 million, respectively.

Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors consists of two basic components: pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics and identifying individually analyzed loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with loans that are pooled into portfolio segments. For pooled loan portfolio segments, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow DCF methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The methodology incorporates a probability of default and loss given default framework. Loss given default is estimated based on historical credit loss experience. Probability of default is estimated utilizing a regression model that incorporates econometric factors. The model utilizes forecasted econometric factors with a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and one-year straight-line reversion period in order to estimate the probability of default for each loan portfolio segment. The DCF methodology combines the probability of default, the loss given default, prepayment speeds and the remaining life of the loan to estimate a reserve for each loan. The ACL for individually analyzed loans is measured using a DCF method based upon the loan s contractual effective interest rate, or at the loan s observable market price, or, if the loan was collateral dependent, at the fair value of the collateral. Quantitative loss factors are also supplemented by certain qualitative risk factors reflecting management s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. Qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts determined by historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. Because the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends, current economic data, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as management s judgment, factors may arise that result in different estimations. Deteriorating conditions or assumptions could lead to further increases in the ACL on loans; conversely, improving conditions or assumptions could lead to further reductions in the ACL on loans. In estimating the ACL on loans, management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from management s estimate. Given the concentration of ACL allocation to the total commercial portfolio and the significant judgments made by management in deriving the qualitative loss factors, management analyzed the impact that changes in judgments could have. The result was an ACL allocated to the total commercial loan portfolio that ranged between 14.0 million and 29.9 million at September 30, 2024. The sensitivity and related range of impact is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at September 30, 2024 in estimation of the ACL on loans recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the assumptions underlying the determination of the ACL prove to be incorrect, the ACL may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and an increase to the ACL may be necessary to allow for different assumptions or adverse developments. In addition, a problem with one or more loans could require a significant increase to the ACL. Proposed Merger On September 9, 2024, Evans Bancorp, Inc. and the Bank entered into an agreement and plan of merger with NBT and NBT Bank, National Association, pursuant to which NBT will acquire Evans Bancorp, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Evans common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.91 shares of NBT common stock. As of September 9, 2024, based on NBT s closing stock price of 46.28 on September 6, 2024, the aggregate transaction value was approximately 236 million. The proposed merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of Evans, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025. Expenses related to the merger are included on the merger related expense line in the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024. For further information on the merger agreement, see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 9, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, merger related expenses were 0.6 million.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Loan Activity Total gross loans were 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024, and 1.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Loans secured by real estate were 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Residential real estate loans, including construction loans, were 444 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, compared with 447 million at December 31, 2023, a 3 million, or less than 1 , decrease. Commercial real estate loans, including construction loans, were 1 billion at September 30, 2024, 39 million or 4 higher than at December 31, 2023, and 52 million, or 5 higher than at September 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, residential mortgage originations were 16 million compared with originations of 15 million in the sequential quarter and 16 million in the third quarter of 2023. The Company originated 41 million in residential mortgages in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 34 million in the first nine months of 2023. The Company sold 9 million of residential mortgages in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 3 million in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 the Company sold 15 million and 7 million, respectively, of residential mortgages. Management decides whether to keep or sell residential mortgage loans at the time of origination based on interest rate risk management and the risk-adjusted return of alternative investment sources such as mortgage-backed securities. The C I portfolio was 256 million at September 30, 2024, representing a 33 million, or 15 , increase from December 31, 2023. When compared with September 30, 2023, C I loans increased 33 million or 15 . Funding levels of C I lines of credit have increased during the first nine months of 2024, contributing to the growth in the C I portfolio. Credit Quality of Loan Portfolio Non-performing loans, defined as accruing loans greater than 90 days past due and nonaccrual loans, totaled 33 million, or 1.82 of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared with 27 million, or 1.59 of total loans outstanding, as of December 31, 2023 and 27 million, or 1.60 of total loans outstanding, as of September 30, 2023. Included in non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 was one C I loan of 6.5 million that was 90 days past due and still accruing as it is expected to be renewed in early fourth quarter. During the third quarter of 2024 the Company sold 6.9 million of other real estate owned that was acquired during the second quarter of 2024. The sale resulted in a gain on sale of other real estate owned of 0.6 million. Internal risk ratings are the credit quality indicators used by management to monitor credit risk in the Company s commercial loan portfolio. Special mention and substandard loans are weaker credits with a higher risk of loss and are categorized as criticized credits rather than pass or watch credits. Commercial credits graded as special mention and substandard were 73 million at September 30, 2024, a 2 million increase from 71 million at December 31, 2023, and a 3 million decrease from 76 million at September 30, 2023. The level of criticized loans can fluctuate as new information is constantly received on the Company s borrowers and their financial circumstances change over time. The Company recorded a 0.6 million provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to loan growth as well as slower prepayment rates. The allowance for credit losses totaled 23.1 million or 1.29 of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared with 22.1 million, or 1.28 of total loans outstanding as of December 31, 2023, and 21.8 million, or 1.28 of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2023.

Investing Activities Total investment securities were 276 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 278 million at December 31, 2023 and 337 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was mainly due to the sale of 78 million of securities during the fourth quarter of 2023 as the company strategically repositioned the balance sheet. Interest-bearing deposits at banks, which consist of overnight funds kept at correspondent banks and the Federal Reserve, were 107 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 4 million at December 31, 2023, and 7 million at September 30, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024 management strategically strengthened the balance sheet by adding 55 million of brokered deposits at favorable rates and lengthened maturities of approximately 40 million in overnight borrowings to manage interest rate risk. As a result, interest-bearing deposits at banks increased significantly compared with the prior periods. The primary objectives of the Company s investment portfolio are to provide liquidity, provide collateral to secure municipal deposits, and maximize income while preserving safety of principal. Average investment securities and interest-bearing cash were 19 of average interest-earning assets in each of the third and second quarters of 2024, compared with 18 in the third quarter of 2023. The Company s highest concentration in its securities portfolio was in available for sale U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities which comprised 62 of total investment securities at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and 54 at September 30, 2023. Tax-advantaged debt securities issued by state and political subdivisions as a percent of the total investment securities portfolio were 4 in the third quarter of 2024, 3 in the second quarter of 2024, and 2 in the third quarter of 2023. The total net unrealized loss position of the available for sale investment portfolio was 47 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 55 million at December 31, 2023 and 77 million at September 30, 2023. The securities in an unrealized loss position at the end of the third quarter of 2024 generally reflected increased market interest rates. Management believes that the credit quality of the securities portfolio as a whole is strong. In addition, the Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their fair value recovers to their amortized cost. The Company monitors extension and prepayment risk in the securities portfolio to limit potential exposures. The Company has no direct exposure to subprime mortgages, nor does the Company hold private mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, or FNMA or FHLMC preferred stock investments in its investment portfolio. Funding Activities Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 1.9 billion, a 182 million, or 11 , increase from December 31, 2023, and an increase of 95 million, or 5 , from September 30, 2023 . From a product perspective, when compared to December 31, 2023, deposit increases were in demand deposits of 45 million, brokered time deposits of 44 million, municipal saving deposits of 27 million, NOW deposits of 27 million, consumer savings of 17 million, consumer time deposits of 9 million, and commercial savings deposits of 13 million. When compared to last year s third quarter, there were increases in NOW deposits of 48 million, brokered time deposits of 44 million, consumer time deposits of 6 million and consumer savings deposits of 9 million, offset by lower demand deposits of 12 million. Total other borrowings decreased from 145 million at December 31, 2023 to 128 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 the Bank had 40 million in long-term Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY advances compared with 6 million at each of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 the Bank did not have overnight borrowings at the FHLB compared with 53 million at December 31, 2023 and 19 million at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, advances up to 373 million could be drawn from the FHLB via the Company s overnight line of credit. Additionally, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve. The Bank had 88 million, 86 million, and 126 million in short-term borrowings with the Federal Reserve at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Net Income Net income was 2.9 million, or 0.53 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2024, compared with 3.6 million, or 0.66 per diluted share, in last year s third quarter. Net income for the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the sequential second quarter of 2024, reflected an increase in net interest income of 0.7 million and an increase in non-interest income of 0.6 million, offset by higher provision for credit losses of 0.3 million and an increase in non-interest expense of 1.0 million, which included 0.6 million of merger related costs associated with our proposed merger with NBT. The change in net income from the prior-year period primarily reflected a decrease in non-interest income of 2.6 million, resulting from the sale of TEA in 2023, partially offset by higher net interest income of 0.8 million and a decrease in non-interest expense of 0.8 million. Return on average equity was 6.44 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 6.76 in the second quarter of 2024 and 9.06 in the third quarter of 2023. Net income was 8.2 million, or 1.49 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 14.4 million, or 2.62 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease from last year s comparative period was due to lower net interest income of 4.0 million, a reduction of non-interest income of 6.7 million, and higher provision for credit losses of 1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expense of 4.0 million. Other Results of Operations Quarterly Comparison Net interest income of 15.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.7 million, or 5 , from the second quarter of 2024, and increased 0.8 million, or 6 , when compared with the prior year s third quarter. The increase in net interest income over the second quarter was due to higher average loans and the Company s investment strategy to strengthen the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The increase in net interest income when compared to the prior year s third quarter was due to higher average loan balances and the stabilization of net interest margin. Third quarter net interest margin of 2.80 increased 9 basis points from the second quarter of 2024 and 1 basis point from the third quarter of 2023. The yield on loans increased 17 basis points compared with the sequential quarter and 55 basis points year-over-year. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.28 compared with 3.27 in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.59 in the third quarter of 2023. The 0.6 million provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024 was largely due to loan growth as well as slower prepayment speeds. Non-interest income was 3.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 2.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, and 5.6 million in the prior year s third quarter. The increase of 0.6 million from the sequential quarter was due to a gain on the sale of one property that the company had in other real estate owned at the end of the second quarter. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was due to lower insurance service and fee revenue of 3.3 million mostly driven by the sale of TEA, partially offset by the sale of the other real estate owned. Non-interest expense was 13.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 12.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 14.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 1.0 million increase from the second quarter of 2024 included merger related expenses of 0.6 million, and higher salaries and employee benefits expense due to the funding of employee health savings accounts during the third quarter. The 0.8 million, or 6 , decrease in non-interest expense from the third quarter of 2023 was mostly due to a decrease of 1.5 million of salaries and employee benefits expense related to the sale of TEA, offset by merit increases given in the beginning of the current year. The Company s GAAP efficiency ratio, or noninterest expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was 75.32 in the third quarter of 2024, 75.11 in the second quarter of 2024, and 72.72 in the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense was 0.9 million, for an effective tax rate of 24.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 23.8 in the second quarter of 2024 and 26.2 in last year s third quarter. Other Results of Operations Year-to-Date Comparison Net interest income was 43.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, a 4.0 million or 8 decrease from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease from last year s comparative period was due to higher cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher interest earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits at banks. Average loans and average interest-bearing deposits at banks increased 72 million and 83 million, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the prior year period.

The Company s net interest margin of 2.76 in the first nine months of 2024 was 36 basis points lower than the 3.12 margin in the first nine months of 2023. The yield on loans during the first nine months of 2024 increased 44 basis points, from 5.22 to 5.66 when compared with the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024 the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 105 basis points to 3.20 when compared with the first nine months of 2023. The rate paid on average time deposits increased from 3.10 in the first nine months of 2023 to 4.40 during the first nine months of 2024. The rate paid on NOW deposits increased 118 basis points to 2.48 when compared with the first nine months of 2023. The Company recorded a 1.1 million provision for credit losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 largely due to loan growth and slow down of prepayment rates, compared to a release of allowance for credit losses of 0.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 7.7 million compared with 14.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The prior year period included insurance service and fee revenue of 8.3 million earned by TEA. Partially offsetting the decrease in insurance service and fee income were a gain on sale of other real estate owned of 0.6 million, 0.2 million revenue from loans sold and income from a historic tax credit investment of 0.2 million during the first nine months of 2024. Total non-interest expense decreased to 39.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, 4.0 million, or 9 , lower than the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Included in the prior-year period was 4.5 million of salaries and employee benefits costs attributed to TEA. Partially offsetting the decrease in salaries and employee benefits were 0.6 million of merger related expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2024. The Company s GAAP efficiency ratio, or noninterest expenses divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was 76.7 in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 69.6 during the prior-year period. The Company recorded income tax expense of 2.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with 4.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 23.3 and 23.7 , respectively. CAPITAL The Company consistently maintains regulatory capital ratios above the federal well capitalized standard, including a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.01 at September 30, 2024, compared with 10.04 at June 30, 2024 and 9.40 at September 30, 2023. Book value per share was 33.58 at June 30, 2024 compared with 32.15 at June 30, 2024 and 27.52 at September 30, 2023. Reflected in the book value changes are the Federal Reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes, which have resulted in significant changes in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, this amounted to 6.36 per share impact to book value. Such unrealized gains and losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale. The Company has issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 11.3 million of junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities outstanding, which are considered Tier 1 capital and includable in total regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had 20 million of its 6.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 outstanding. During 2020, 15 million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes was contributed to Evans Bank as Tier 1 capital. While we are currently classified as well capitalized , an extended economic recession could adversely impact our reported and regulatory capital ratios. The Company relies on cash on hand as well as dividends from its subsidiary bank to service its debt. If the Company s subsidiary bank s capital deteriorates such that it is unable to pay dividends to the Company for an extended period of time, the Company may not be able to service its debt that was issued. LIQUIDITY The Bank utilizes cash flows from the investment portfolio and federal funds sold balances to manage the liquidity requirements related to loan demand and deposit fluctuations. The Bank also has many borrowing options. The Company uses the FHLBNY as its primary source of overnight funds and has long-term advance with FHLBNY. The Company s use of its overnight line of credit with FHLBNY varies depending on its ability to fund investment and loan growth with core deposits along with the line usage s impact on interest rate risk. The Company has pledged sufficient collateral in the form of residential and commercial real estate loans at FHLBNY that meets FHLB collateral requirements. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is able to borrow funds at competitive rates. As of September 30, 2024, advances of up to 373 million could be drawn on the FHLB via an Overnight Line of Credit Agreement between the Bank and 

 40 
 Table of Contents 

the FHLB. The Bank also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve. At September 30, 2024 the Bank had 8 million in additional availability to borrow against collateral at the Federal Reserve. By placing sufficient collateral in safekeeping at the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank could borrow at the discount window. The Bank s liquidity needs also can be met by more aggressively pursuing time deposits, or accessing the brokered time deposit market, including the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS network. Cash flows from the Bank s investment portfolio are laddered, so that securities mature at regular intervals, to provide funds from principal and interest payments at various times as liquidity needs may arise. Contractual maturities are also laddered, with consideration as to the volatility of market prices. At September 30, 2024, approximately 1 of the Bank s securities had contractual maturity dates of one year or less and approximately 17 had maturity dates of five years or less. Additionally, mortgage-backed securities, which comprised 62 of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, provide consistent cash flows for the Bank. The Company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Additionally, the Company has access to capital markets as a funding source. Management, on an ongoing basis, closely monitors the Company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business. As part of that monitoring process, management calculates the 90-day liquidity position each month by analyzing the cash needs of the Bank. Included in the calculation are assumptions of some significant deposit run-off as well as funds needed for loan closings and investment purchases. I n the Company s internal stress test at September 30, 2024, the Company had net short-term liquidity of 351 million as compared with 333 million at December 31, 2023. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and which would therefore result in significant pressure on liquidity. However, an economic recession could negatively impact the Company s liquidity. The Bank relies heavily on FHLBNY as a source of funds, particularly with its overnight line of credit. In past economic recessions, some FHLB branches have suspended dividends, cut dividend payments, and not bought back excess FHLB stock that members hold in an effort to conserve capital. FHLBNY has stated that it expects to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. The 11 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system s debt, other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment. Systemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks. ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Additional information responsive to this Item is contained in the Liquidity section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates of the Bank s financial instruments. The primary market risk that the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. The core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Bank to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Bank is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Bank measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income to changes in net interest rates. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans, and deposits. Management supplements the modeling technique described above with analysis of market values of the Bank s financial instruments and changes to such market values given changes in the interest rates. The Bank s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the Bank s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit taking activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changing the

 Table of Contents 

pricing of loan and deposit products, and modifying the composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and reliance on other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. The following table demonstrates the possible impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank s net interest income over a 12-month period of time: SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES Calculated increase (decrease) in projected annual net interest income (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Changes in interest rates +200 basis points (3,542) (4,618) +100 basis points 1,074 219 -100 basis points (1,132) (168) -200 basis points (2,416) (310) 
 Many assumptions were utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the Bank s net interest income. The more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. The Bank assumed immediate changes in rates including 200 basis point rate changes. In the 200 basis point rate reduction scenario, the applicable rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates are not less than zero. The assumptions in the Company s projections are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Bank cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Bank s projected net interest income. ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Report). Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting were identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The nature of the Company s business generates a certain amount of litigation involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, there are no proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which its property is subject, which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The following risk factors relating to the Company s proposed merger with NBT Bancorp Inc. NBT represent a material update and addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024: The Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on the Company s employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the effective time of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with NBT. The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect the financial results of the Company. In addition, the merger agreement requires that the Company operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and restricts the Company from taking certain actions prior to the effective time of the merger or termination of the merger agreement without NBT s written consent. These restrictions may prevent the Company from retaining existing customers or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. The merger agreement contains provisions that limit the Company s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company. The merger agreement contains covenants that restrict the Company s ability to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, induce, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate inquiries, offers or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the Company s Board of Directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. Additionally, the merger agreement provides for an 8.4 million termination fee payable by the Company to NBT under certain circumstances. Such provisions may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from pursuing such acquisition. The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. NBT and the Company can mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time before the merger has been completed, and either company can terminate the merger agreement if: any regulatory approval required for consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement has been denied by final, nonappealable action of any regulatory authority, or an application for regulatory approval has been permanently withdrawn at the request of a governmental authority; the required approval of the merger agreement by the Company s shareholders is not obtained; the other party materially breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the merger agreement (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement), which breach is not cured within 30 days of written notice of the breach, or by its nature cannot be cured prior to the closing of the merger, and such breach would entitle the non-breaching party not to consummate the merger; or merger is not consummated by September 15, 2025, unless the failure to consummate the merger by such date is due to a material breach of the merger agreement by the terminating party. 

 43 
 Table of Contents 

In addition, NBT may terminate the merger agreement if: the Company materially breaches the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; or the Company s Board of Directors: o fails to recommend approval of the merger agreement, or withdraws, modifies or changes such recommendation in a manner adverse to NBT s interests; o recommends, proposes or publicly announces its intention to recommend or propose to engage in an acquisition transaction with any person other than NBT or any of its subsidiaries; or o fails to call, give notice of, convene and hold its special meeting. The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of waivers and/or approvals from governmental authorities, that may delay the merger or adversely impact NBT s and the Company s ability to complete the merger. The completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Before the merger may be completed, certain approvals, waivers or consents must be obtained from federal governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Satisfying the requirements of these governmental authorities may delay the date of completion of the merger. In addition, these governmental authorities may include conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. While it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed promptly following the receipt of all required regulatory and shareholder approvals, there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied. The parties are not obligated to complete the merger should any regulatory approval contain a condition, restriction or requirement that NBT reasonably determines in good faith would, individually or in the aggregate, materially reduce the benefits of the merger to such a degree that NBT would not have entered into the merger agreement had such condition, restriction or requirement been known at the date of the merger agreement. NBT and the Company cannot provide any assurances with respect to the timing of the closing of the merger, whether the merger will be completed at all and when Company shareholders would receive the consideration for the merger, if at all. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future business and financial results of the Company. Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including approval by the Company s shareholders of the merger. The Company cannot guarantee when or if these conditions will be satisfied or that the merger will be successfully completed. The consummation of the merger may be delayed, the merger may be consummated on terms different than those contemplated by the merger agreement, or the merger may not be consummated at all. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of the Company may be adversely affected, and the Company will be subject to several risks, including the following: the Company may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay NBT a termination fee of 8.4 million; the Company could incur substantial costs relating to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees; the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and the Company s management s and employees attention may be diverted from our day-to-day business and operational matters as a result of efforts relating to the attempt to consummate the merger. In addition, if the merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their respective customers and employees. The Company also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against the Company to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. Such events could materially affect the Company s stock prices and business and financial results. Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the merger or otherwise negatively affect the business and operations of the Company. The Company may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the proposed merger. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.
