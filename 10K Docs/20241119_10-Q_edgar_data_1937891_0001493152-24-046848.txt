(the Business Combination Agreement with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company Merger Sub ), and Wanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company Wanshun ).

which the Business Combination Agreement was terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e) of the Business Combination Agreement. The termination
of the Business Combination Agreement is effective as of March 18, 2024. 

For
additional information regarding the Transactions, the Business Combination Agreement, Notice of Termination of Business Combination

14, 2023, August 17, 2023 and March 25, 2024. 

On
May 2, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note to AMC (defined below) (the Extension Note 2 ), pursuant to which the
Company could borrow an aggregate of to cover expenses in connection with the extension of Business Combination Period. The
Extension Note 2 bears no interest. The entire unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be payable on the earlier of: (i) December

terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, an in accordance with applicable law, Merger Sub will merge with AMC, with
AMC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Going
Concern Consideration and Management Liquidity Plans 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of and working capital deficit of . Subsequent to the consummation of the
IPO, the Company expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant
transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company expects that it will need additional capital
to satisfy its needs for paying these costs. Although certain of the Company s initial shareholders or their affiliates may loan
the Company funds, there s no guarantee that the Company will receive such funds. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management
believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of the initial
Business Combination or one year from the issuance date of this financial statements. There is no assurance that the Company s
plan to consummate a business combination will be successful. If a Business Combination is not consummated by the relevant period, there
will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

On
September 13, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department (the
 Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company is not in compliance
with Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) (the Minimum Public Holders Rule ), which requires the Company to have at least 400 total holders
for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. An indicator will be displayed with quotation information related to the Company s
securities on listingcenter.nasdaq.com and may be displayed by other third-party providers of market data information, however, the Notice
does not impact the listing of the Company s securities on The Nasdaq Global Market at this time. The Notice states that the Company
has 45 calendar days, or until October 28, 2024, to submit a plan (the Company s Plan to regain compliance with
the Minimum Public Holders Rule. If the Company is unable to regain compliance by that date, the Company intends to submit a plan to
regain compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Rule within the required timeframe. If Nasdaq accepts the Company s Plan, Nasdaq
may grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice to evidence compliance with the Minimum Public
Holders Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company s Plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front
of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. However, there can be no assurance that such an appeal would be successful. The Company, by filing this Current
Report Form 8-K, discloses its receipt of the Notice in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(b). The Company intends to monitor its
total holders between now and October 28, 2024, and may, if appropriate, evaluate available options to resolve the deficiency under the
Minimum Public Holders Rule and regain compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Rule. Additionally, the Company may consider applying
to transfer the listing of its securities to The Nasdaq Capital Market (provided that it then satisfies the requirements for continued
listing on that market). However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with Nasdaq
listing criteria. The Company submitted the Company s Plan on October 28, 2024 to transfer the listing of our Ordinary Shares,
Units and Rights from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management
continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could
have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the
specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

There

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

References
to the Company, our, us or we refer to AlphaVest Acquisition Corp. The following
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
financial statements and the notes related thereto. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes
forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of many factors. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 14, 2022 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we intend to focus our search on businesses
in Asia, we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination.
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive
discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using
cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private units, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in
connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception through September 30,
2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO described below and
identifying a target company for our initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the
completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held after the IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial
reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing,
a Business Combination. 

For
three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 502,021, which consists of interest earned on marketable securities held
in Trust Account and bank interest income of 684,601, offset by formation and operating costs of 182,580. 

For
nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 1,234,008, which consists of interest earned on marketable securities held
in Trust Account and bank interest income of 1,893,227, offset by formation and operating costs of 566,903 and unrealized loss on the
investment of 92,316. 

For
three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 755,988, which consists of interest earned on marketable securities held
in Trust Account and bank interest income of 954,809, offset by formation and operating costs of 198,821. 

For
nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 2,105,442, which consists of interest earned on marketable securities held
in Trust Account and bank interest income of 2,592,636, offset by formation and operating costs of 487,194. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources, and Going Concern 

On
December 22, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 Units and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in
the Units sold, the Public Shares at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the
Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 390,000 Private Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit in a private placement
to the Sponsor and EBC (365,000 private units to Sponsor and 25,000 private units to EBC), generating gross proceeds of 3,900,000. 

On
December 29, 2022, EBC fully exercised their over-allotment option, resulting in an additional 900,000 Units issued for an aggregate
amount of 9,000,000. In connection with the EBC s full exercise of their over-allotment option, the Company also consummated the
sale of an additional 40,500 Private Units at 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 405,000. 

Following
the full exercise of over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, an amount of 70,380,000 10.20 per Unit) was placed
in the trust account. The funds held in the Trust Account may be invested in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or
less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us. We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, to complete our
initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete
our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations
of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

15 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the trust account of 53,011,509 (including 5,419,445 of interest income
as of September 30, 2024) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Interest
income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2024, we have not withdrawn any interest
earned from the trust account. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 7,095 and a working capital deficit of 1,276,719. On May 2, 2024, we issued a promissory note
to AMC Corporation in the aggregate principal amount of 126,000, to be used, in part, for operating costs. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a
non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In
the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account
to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Other than as described above,
the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust
account. 

If
our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial
business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because
we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which
case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we are targeting businesses
larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Units, and may as a result be required to seek
additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we
would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate
the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional
financing in order to meet our obligations. 

There
is no assurance that our plans to consummate a business combination will be successful within the combination period. As a result, there
is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management
believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of the initial
Business Combination or one year from the issuance date of this financial statements. There is no assurance that the Company s
plan to consummate a business combination will be successful. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2024. We do not participate
in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Related
Party Transactions 

On
February 7, 2022, the sponsor received 1,725,000 of the Company s ordinary shares in exchange for 25,000 paid for deferred offering
costs borne by the founder. Up to 225,000 of such founder shares are subject to forfeiture to the extent that EBC s over-allotment
is not exercised in full. As a result of EBC s election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on December 29, 2022, no
founder shares are currently subject to forfeiture. 

On
June 3, 2022, the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note with AlphaVest Holding LP (the Promissory Note ), pursuant
to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate of 150,000 to cover expenses related to the IPO. On April 11, 2024, the
Company amended and restated the Promissory Note with AlphaVest Holding LP to extend the maturity date to the earlier of : (i) September
12, 2024 or (ii) promptly after the date of the consummation of the business combination. The Promissory
Note expired on September 12, 2024. 

On
April 18, 2023, AlphaVest Holding LP, one of our sponsors, transferred an aggregate of 1,035,000 founder shares to Peace Capital Limited,
our other sponsor. 

The
Sponsors have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur
of: (A) six months after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (B) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger,
share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our public
shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.

Other
Contractual Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities reflected on our balance
sheet. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the Founder Shares, EBC founder shares, Private Placement Units will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration
rights agreement dated July 11, 2023 requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. Subject to certain limitations set
forth in such agreement, the holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration
demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights
with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to
register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides
that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until
the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Business
Combination Marketing Agreement 

We
have engaged EBC as an advisor in connection with its Business Combination to assist in holding meetings with the Company stockholders
to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors
that are interested in purchasing its securities in connection with its initial Business Combination and assist with press releases and
public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay EBC a service fee for such services upon the consummation
of its initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO. In addition, the Company will pay EBC
a service fee in an amount equal to 1.0 of the total consideration payable in the initial Business Combination if it introduces the
Company to the target business with whom it completes an initial Business Combination and the amount will be payable in cash and is due
at the closing date of the initial Business Combination. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates and all the significant
accounting policies are described in the Note 2 of this reviewed financial statements. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our financial statements.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying
Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under
the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an assessment regarding the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment under the criteria
described above, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
