 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 of a controlled subsidiary s earnings, rather than only our share. Transactions between the parent company and noncontrolling interests are reported in equity as transactions between stockholders, provided that these transactions do not create a change in control. Our business is dependent on external weather factors. Historically, we have experienced strong sales and net income in our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters comprising the three-month periods ending August 31, November 30, and May 31, respectively, with weaker performance in our third fiscal quarter (December through February). 

the new standard on , on a retrospective basis other than the roll-forward guidance, which we plan to adopt on a prospective basis beginning with our fiscal 2025 annual financial statements. As of adoption on June 1, 2023, we did t have any material supplier finance program obligations; however, we began such an arrangement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Refer to Note 14, Supply Chain Financing, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. New Pronouncements Issued In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which requires a public business entity to disclose specific categories in its annual effective tax rate reconciliation and disaggregated information about significant reconciling items by jurisdiction and by nature. The ASU also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments (net of refunds) to international, federal, and state and local jurisdictions. The guidance makes several other changes to income tax disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on our disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," which expands disclosures about a public business entity's reportable segments and provides for more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on our disclosures.

million compared to our prior quarter estimate, attributable to decreases in expected facility closure and other related costs of million and increases in expected severance and benefit charges of million. Throughout our MAP 2025 initiative, we will continue to assess and find areas of improvement and cost savings. As such, the final implementation of the aforementioned phases and total expected costs are subject to change. USL Restructuring During the quarter ended August 31, 2023, we recognized a loss on sale of million in connection with the divestiture of USL s Bridgecare services division. The Bridgecare division was a contracting business focused on the installation of joints and waterproofing in the UK. The loss on this sale was included in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income and net loss on sales of assets and businesses in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, during the quarter ended August 31, 2023, in connection with MAP 2025, we realigned certain businesses and management structures within our segments. Within our PCG segment, certain businesses of our USL reporting unit were transferred to our Fibergrate, Carboline and Stonhard reporting units. As a result of this change in our market strategy, we performed an interim impairment assessment of the USL indefinite-lived tradename. Calculating the fair value of the USL s indefinite-lived tradename required the use of various estimates and assumptions. We estimated the fair value of USL s indefinite-lived tradename by applying a relief-from-royalty calculation, which included discounted future cash flows related to projected revenues impacted by this decision. In applying this methodology, we relied on a number of factors, including actual and forecasted revenues and market data. As the carrying amount of the tradename exceeded its fair value, an impairment loss of million was recorded for the three months ended August 31, 2023. This impairment loss was classified as restructuring expense within our PCG segment.

for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compares to the effective income tax rate of for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The effective income tax rates for both periods reflect variances from the statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of state and local income taxes, non-deductible business expenses, and the net tax on foreign subsidiary income resulting from the global intangible low-taxed income provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to equity compensation. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for the current three-month period ended August 31, 2024, reflects a favorable adjustment for incremental U.S. foreign tax credits associated with a distribution of historic foreign earnings that were previously not considered to be permanently reinvested. The distribution of such earnings was done in conjunction with global cash redeployment and debt optimization projects executed during the quarter. The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended August 31, 2023 reflected incremental tax expense related to a change in the estimated net deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings and our liability for uncertain tax positions. Our deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings was adjusted to million as of May 31, 2024. The million represented our estimate of the net tax cost of remitting of million of foreign earnings that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of August 31, 2024, the amount of these earnings has changed to million and we longer have a tax liability associated with remitting these earnings. The reduction to the earnings amounts no longer permanently reinvested is due principally to distributions of such earnings during the quarter. We have not provided for foreign withholding or income taxes on the remaining foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because such earnings have been retained and reinvested by the subsidiaries as of August 31, 2024. Accordingly, provision has been made for foreign withholding or income taxes, which may become payable if the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted to us as dividends.
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD has proposed a framework comprised of rules and models, collectively referred to as Pillar Two P2 ), that are designed to ensure that certain multi-national enterprises pay a minimum tax rate of on reported profits arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. Although the OECD provided a framework for applying the minimum tax, individual countries have and may continue to enact P2 rules that are different than the OECD framework. While we continue to monitor P2 developments, we do not anticipate that P2 will have a material impact on our long-term financial position.

, we announced our authorization of a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of RPM International Inc. common stock at management s discretion. As announced on November 28, 2018, our goal was to return billion in capital to stockholders by May 31, 2021 through share repurchases and the retirement of our convertible note during fiscal 2019. On April 16, 2019, after taking into account share repurchases under our existing stock repurchase program to date, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the remaining million in value of RPM International Inc. common stock by May 31, 2021. As previously announced, given macroeconomic uncertainty resulting from the Covid pandemic, we had suspended stock repurchases under the program, but in January 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the resumption of the stock repurchases. At the time of resuming the program, million of shares of common stock remained available for repurchase. The Board of Directors also extended the stock repurchase program beyond its original expiration date until such time that the remaining million of capital has been returned to our stockholders. As a result, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at various times and in amounts and for prices that our management deems appropriate, subject to insider trading rules and other securities law restrictions. The timing of our purchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. We may limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million, or an average of per share, under this program. During the three months ended August 31, 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock at a cost of million, or an average of per share, under this program. The maximum dollar amount that may yet be repurchased under our stock repurchase program was approximately million at August 31, 2024.

 Environmental Matters Like other companies participating in similar lines of business, some of our subsidiaries are involved in environmental remediation matters. It is our policy to accrue remediation costs when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have committed to an appropriate plan of action. We also take into consideration the estimated period of time over which payments may be required. The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation activities continue, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The liabilities are not offset by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state-managed sites, third-party indemnity obligations, and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites.

million in damages to the distributor. Per the parties contracts, the distributor was also entitled to seek recovery of some portion of its attorneys fees and costs. On July 3, 2023, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision rejecting the distributor's arguments and denying all appellate relief to the distributor, which also rendered our cross-appeal moot. On November 15, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California issued an order awarding the distributor approximately million in connection with attorney's fees and costs the distributor allegedly incurred throughout the duration of this legal action. As a result of this order, we increased our accrual to million as of November 30, 2023. On December 27, 2023, we paid the million judgment, and then decreased our accrual to approximately million. However, because we strongly disagree with the District Court's order awarding attorneys fees and costs to the distributor, we timely filed an appeal of this order with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which remains pending. This contingency remains a liability of the Company. One of our subsidiaries in our Consumer reportable segment has been the subject of a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in which a former supplier of that subsidiary alleged that the subsidiary breached certain contractual obligations, misappropriated trade secrets, and committed fraud in connection with an Exclusive Sales Agreement and a Mutual Settlement Agreement and Release executed in November 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our subsidiary denied, and continues to deny, these allegations. A jury trial commenced in this matter on . On September 27, 2024, the jury rendered a verdict against our subsidiary for million, consisting of both compensatory and punitive damages. We believe that the jury verdict is not supported by the facts of the case or applicable law, is the result of significant trial error, and there are strong grounds for appeal. We intend to vigorously challenge the verdict through appropriate post-trial motions and appellate processes. As a result, we believe that the likelihood that the amount of the judgment will be affirmed is not probable. We currently estimate a range of possible outcomes between approximately million and million, and we have accrued a liability as of August 31, 2024, at the low end of the range, as no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. This amount is reflected in accrued losses, and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended August 31, 2024. The ultimate loss to the Company with respect to the litigation matter could be materially different from the amount the Company has accrued. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. Gain on Business Interruption Insurance In April 2021, there was a significant plant explosion at a key alkyd resin supplier which caused severe supply chain disruptions. As a result of this disruption, the Consumer segment incurred incremental costs and lost sales during fiscal 2021 and 2022. A claim for these losses was submitted under our business interruption insurance policy. The Consumer segment recovered million from insurance during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which was recorded as a gain in the three-month period ending August 31, 2023. No such proceeds were received during the three-month period ending August 31, 2024. The insurance gains are recorded as a reduction to SG A expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and the proceeds are included within cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

 notice. The total amount due to the financial institution to settle supplier invoices under the supply chain finance program was million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

reportable segments. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point in time. However, we also record revenues generated under construction contracts, mainly in connection with the installation of specialized roofing and flooring systems and related services. For certain polymer flooring installation projects, we account for our revenue using the output method, as we consider square footage of completed flooring to be the best measure of progress toward the complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. In contrast, for certain of our roofing installation projects, we account for our revenue using the input method, as that method is the best measure of performance as it considers costs incurred in relation to total expected project costs, which essentially represents the transfer of control for roofing systems to the customer. In general, for our construction contracts, we record contract revenues and related costs as our contracts progress on an over-time model. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. . In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs, as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to control transfer. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and/or services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. For example, judgment is required to determine whether products sold in connection with the sale of installation services are considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with installation services and recognized over time. We provide customer rebate programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. These customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration and recognized as a reduction of net sales. Up-front consideration provided to customers is capitalized as a component of other assets and amortized over the estimated life of the contractual arrangement. We include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. In general, this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to our volume-based incentives. This determination is updated each reporting period. Certain of our contracts include contingent consideration that is receivable only upon the final inspection and acceptance of a project. We include estimates of such variable consideration in our transaction price. Based on historical experience, we consider the probability-based expected value method appropriate to estimate the amount of such variable consideration. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, and we may provide other credits or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We record a right of return liability to accrue for expected customer returns. Historical actual returns are used to estimate future returns as a percentage of current sales. Obligations for returns and refunds were not material individually or in the aggregate. We offer assurance type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term. Warranty liabilities for our assurance type warranties are discussed further in Note 13, Contingencies and Accrued Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Contract Assets 

The million increase in our net contract assets from May 31, 2024 to August 31, 2024, resulted primarily due to the timing of construction jobs in progress at August 31, 2024 versus May 31, 2024. During the three-month periods ending August 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million of revenue, which is included in contract liabilities as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also record long-term deferred revenue, which amounted to million and million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The long-term portion of deferred revenue is related to warranty contracts and is included in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have elected to adopt the practical expedient to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period for performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. As our contract terms are primarily one year or less in duration, we have elected to apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Allowance for Credit Losses Our primary allowance for credit losses is the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the trade accounts receivable balance to the estimated net realizable value equal to the amount that is expected to be collected. The allowance was based on assessments of current creditworthiness of customers, historical collection experience, the aging of receivables and other currently available evidence. Trade accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if a final determination of uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowances for doubtful collection of accounts are included in SG A expenses.

reportable segments as outlined below, which also represent our operating segments. Within each operating segment, we manage product lines and businesses which generally address common markets, share similar economic characteristics, utilize similar technologies and can share manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Our operating segments represent components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate the assets of the company and evaluate performance. These four operating segments are each managed by an operating segment manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day operating decisions and performance evaluation of the operating segment s underlying businesses. We evaluate the profit performance of our segments primarily based on income before income taxes, but also look to earnings (loss) before interest and taxes EBIT ), as a performance evaluation measure because interest (income) expense, net is essentially related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations. Our CPG reportable segment products and services are sold throughout North America and also account for a significant portion of our international sales. Our construction product lines are sold directly to manufacturers, contractors, distributors and end-users, including industrial manufacturing facilities, concrete and cement producers, public institutions and other commercial customers. Products and services within this reportable segment include construction sealants and adhesives, coatings and chemicals, roofing systems, concrete admixture and repair products, building envelope solutions, parking decks, insulated cladding, firestopping, flooring systems, and weatherproofing solutions. Our PCG reportable segment products and services are sold throughout North America, as well as internationally, and are sold directly to contractors, distributors and end-users, such as industrial manufacturing facilities, public institutions and other commercial customers. Products and services within this reportable segment include high-performance flooring solutions, corrosion control and fireproofing coatings, infrastructure repair systems and FRP structures. Our Consumer reportable segment manufactures and markets professional use and DIY products for a variety of mainly residential applications, including home improvement and personal leisure activities. Our Consumer reportable segment s major manufacturing and distribution operations are located primarily in North America, along with a few locations in Europe, Australia and South America. Our Consumer reportable segment products are primarily sold directly to mass merchandisers, home improvement centers, hardware stores, paint stores, craft shops and through distributors. The Consumer reportable segment offers products that include specialty, hobby and professional paints; caulks; adhesives; cleaners; sandpaper and other abrasives; silicone sealants and wood stains. Our SPG reportable segment products are sold throughout North America and internationally, primarily in Europe. Our SPG product lines are sold directly to contractors, distributors and end-users, such as industrial manufacturing facilities, public institutions and other commercial customers. The SPG reportable segment offers products that include restoration services equipment, colorants, nail enamels, factory applied industrial coatings, preservation products, and edible coatings and specialty glazes for pharmaceutical and food industries. In addition to our four reportable segments, there is a category of certain business activities and expenses, referred to as corporate/other, that does not constitute an operating segment. This category includes our corporate headquarters and related administrative expenses, results of our captive insurance companies, gains or losses on the sales of certain assets and other expenses not directly associated with any reportable segment. Assets related to the corporate/other category consist primarily of investments, prepaid expenses and headquarters property and equipment. These corporate and other assets and expenses reconcile reportable segment data to total consolidated income before income taxes and identifiable assets. We reflect income from our joint ventures on the equity method and receive royalties from our licensees.

ITEM 2.	 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our financial statements include all of our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Investments in less-than-majority-owned joint ventures over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates, including those related to our allowances for doubtful accounts; reserves for excess and obsolete inventories; allowances for recoverable sales and/or value-added taxes; uncertain tax positions; useful lives of property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; environmental, warranties and other contingent liabilities; income tax valuation allowances; pension plans; and the fair value of financial instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience, our most recent facts, and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Actual results, which are shaped by actual market conditions, may differ materially from our estimates. 
 A comprehensive discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that are the most critical to our financial statements are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024.

 (c)	EBIT is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes. We evaluate the profit performance of our segments based on income before income taxes, but also look to EBIT, as a performance evaluation measure because Interest Income (Expense), Net is essentially related to corporate functions, as opposed to segment operations. We believe EBIT is useful to investors for this purpose as well, using EBIT as a metric in their investment decisions. EBIT should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, income before income taxes as determined in accordance with GAAP, since EBIT omits the impact of interest in determining operating performance, which represent items necessary to our continued operations, given our level of indebtedness. Nonetheless, EBIT is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that this measure is critical to the capital markets' analysis of our segments' core operating performance. We also evaluate EBIT because it is clear that movements in EBIT impact our ability to attract financing. Our underwriters and bankers consistently require inclusion of this measure in offering memoranda in conjunction with any debt underwriting or bank financing. EBIT may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results.

(1) Organic growth (decline) includes the impact of price and volume. 

Our CPG segment generated organic sales growth during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, led by turnkey roofing systems and wall systems serving high-performance building construction and remodeling, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation. This growth is in addition to a strong prior year period when segment sales grew 10.8 . 
 Our PCG segment generated organic sales growth during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared to the same prior year period. Organic sales growth was driven by the flooring business, which benefited from its focus on maintenance and restoration and specified solutions for high-performance new construction projects. This increase was also facilitated by improved demand in emerging markets. The divestiture of USL's Bridgecare services division in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and unfavorable foreign exchange translation offset this growth. 
 Our Consumer segment experienced sales declines in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 driven by reduced DIY takeaway at retail, customer destocking, the rationalization of certain lower-margin products and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. This was partially offset by volume growth in certain international markets. 
 Our SPG segment experienced organic sales declines during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which were driven by soft demand in specialty OEM markets and a decline in the disaster restoration business as high customer inventories muted the impact of storm activity in the current period. 
 Gross Profit Margin Our consolidated gross profit margin of 42.5 of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compares to a consolidated gross profit margin of 41.2 for the comparable period a year ago. The current quarter gross profit margin increase of approximately 1.3 , or 130 basis points, resulted primarily from our MAP 2025 initiatives, which generated incremental savings in procurement, manufacturing and commercial excellence that favorably impacted our gross margin, in conjunction with benefits generated from the commodity cycle. 
 We expect year-over-year gross margins to continue improving in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 due to MAP 2025 initiatives. 
 SG A Our consolidated SG A expense during the period was 4.9 million lower versus the same period last year but increased to 26.7 of net sales from 26.4 of net sales for the prior year quarter. Reduced bad debt expense, stock compensation and insurance costs were primary drivers, along with MAP savings. In addition, the prior period includes the 4.5 million loss on the sale of USL's Bridgecare services division as described above in Note 3, "Restructuring," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These reductions were partially offset by increased commission expense and bonuses, along with merit increases. Further, the prior period includes the 10.3 million gain on business interruption insurance proceeds as described above in Note 13, "Contingencies and Other Accrued Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which did not recur. 
 Our CPG segment SG A decreased approximately 3.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable prior year period and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in expense was mainly due MAP savings and a decrease in warranty expense, partially offset by variable costs associated with improved results such as commissions, along with merit increases. 
 Our PCG segment SG A was approximately 12.0 million lower for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable prior year period and decreased as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in expense was mainly due to a reduction in bad debt expense, along with the 4.5 million loss on the sale of USL's Bridgecare services division recorded during the prior year quarter. 
 Our Consumer segment SG A increased by approximately 12.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the same period last year and increased as a percentage of net sales. The quarter-over-quarter increase in SG A was primarily attributable to the 10.3 million gain on business interruption insurance proceeds received in the prior period that did not recur in the current period and merit increases, partially offset by MAP savings, along with decreased advertising costs and a reduction in variable distribution costs. 
 24 

Our SPG segment SG A increased approximately 0.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 versus the comparable prior year period and increased as a percentage of net sales. The increase in SG A expense is attributable to investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by MAP savings. 
 SG A expenses in our corporate/other category during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased approximately 2.6 million versus last year s first quarter. This was mainly due to decreased insurance costs, reduced professional fees related to our MAP 2025 operational improvement initiatives and reduced stock compensation, partially offset by increased employee related expenses. 
 The following table summarizes the retirement-related benefit plans impact on income before income taxes for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, as the service cost component has a significant impact on our SG A expense:

 Restructuring Charges 
 The following table summarizes restructuring charges recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, related to our MAP 2025 initiative, which is a multi-year restructuring plan designed to improve margins by streamlining business processes, reducing working capital, implementing commercial initiatives to drive improved mix, pricing discipline and salesforce effectiveness and improving operating efficiency:

On a consolidated basis, our results reflect MAP 2025 benefits, including benefits generated from the commodity cycle. Our CPG segment results reflect improved fixed-cost utilization from volume growth and MAP 2025 benefits. Our PCG segment results reflect improved fixed-cost leverage from positive volumes, which were enhanced by MAP 2025 initiatives. In addition, our prior PCG segment results reflect the 4.5 million loss on the sale of USL's Bridgecare services division, the impairment of an indefinite lived-intangible asset, and higher bad debt expense. Our Consumer segment results reflect negative volumes and the impact on fixed-cost absorption while our prior period results include the 10.3 million gain on business interruption insurance proceeds. The current period earnings decline was mitigated by improved operating efficiencies related to MAP 2025 and rationalization of lower margin products. Our SPG segment results reflect sales declines and reduced fixed cost leverage at plants, partially offset by MAP 2025 benefits. Our Non-Op segment results reflect reduced interest expense, pension non-service costs, insurance costs and stock compensation, partially offset by increased employee related costs. 
 Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 21.3 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compares to the effective income tax rate of 25.2 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The effective income tax rates for both periods reflect variances from the 21 statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of state and local income taxes, non-deductible business expenses, and the net tax on foreign subsidiary income resulting from the global intangible low-taxed income provisions, partially offset by tax benefits related to equity compensation. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, reflects a favorable adjustment for incremental U.S. foreign tax credits associated with the distribution of historic foreign earnings that were previously not considered to be permanently reinvested. The distribution of such earnings was done in conjunction with global cash redeployment and debt optimization projects executed during the quarter. The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended August 31, 2023, reflected incremental tax expense related to increases in the estimated net deferred income tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings and our liability for uncertain tax positions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Fiscal 2025 Compared with Fiscal 2024 
 Operating Activities 
 Approximately 248.1 million of cash was provided by operating activities during the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared with 359.2 million of cash provided by operating activities during the same period last year. The net change in cash from operations includes the change in net income, which increased by 27.2 million during the first three months of fiscal 2025 versus the same period during fiscal 2024. 
 During the first three months of fiscal 2025, the change in accounts receivable provided approximately 9.7 million less cash than the first three months of fiscal 2024. Average days sales outstanding DSO at August 31, 2024, decreased to 60.2 days from 64.3 days at August 31, 2023. 
 During the first three months of fiscal 2025, the change in inventory used approximately 66.3 million more cash compared to spending during the same period a year ago. This is due to increased inventory purchases compared to the prior year period when our operating segments were using safety stock built up in response to supply chain outages and raw material inflation. Average days of inventory outstanding DIO at August 31, 2024 decreased to 76.7 days from 85.1 days at August 31, 2023. 
 26 

The change in accounts payable during the first three months of fiscal 2025 used approximately 33.3 million less cash than during the first three months of fiscal 2024. This is associated with working capital efficiencies enabled by MAP 2025 initiatives. Average days payables outstanding DPO increased to 87.3 days at August 31, 2024 from 79.7 days at August 31, 2023. 
 The change in accrued compensation and benefits during the first three months of fiscal 2025 used approximately 28.3 million more cash than during the first three months of fiscal 2024. This was primarily associated with increased bonus payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the first three months of fiscal 2025, cash used for investing activities increased slightly by 2.6 million to 64.1 million as compared to 61.5 million in the prior year period. This year-over-year increase in cash used for investing activities was driven by a 2.2 million increase in cash used for business acquisitions. 
 We paid for capital expenditures of 50.7 million and 52.2 million during the first three months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Our capital expenditures facilitate our continued growth, allow us to achieve production and distribution efficiencies, expand capacity, introduce new technology, improve environmental health and safety capabilities, improve information systems, and enhance our administration capabilities. We continue to invest capital spending in growth initiatives and to improve operational efficiencies in fiscal 2025. 
 Our captive insurance companies invest their excess cash in marketable securities in the ordinary course of conducting their operations, and this activity will continue. Differences in the amounts related to these activities on a year-over-year basis are primarily attributable to differences in the timing and performance of their investments balanced against amounts required to satisfy claims. At August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the fair value of our investments in available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities, which includes captive insurance-related assets, totaled 169.7 million and 154.3 million, respectively. 
 As of August 31, 2024, approximately 208.6 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries, compared with 215.2 million at May 31, 2024. Undistributed earnings held at our foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested will be used, for instance, to expand operations organically or for acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions. Further, our operations in the U.S. generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy U.S. operating requirements. Refer to Note 7, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unremitted foreign earnings. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the first three months of fiscal 2025, financing activities used 186.0 million of cash, which compares to cash used for financing activities of 274.3 million during the first three months of fiscal 2024. The overall decrease in cash used for financing activities was driven principally by debt-related activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, we repaid the 130.0 million outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization program ("AR Program"), compared to payments of 175.0 million in the prior year period. In addition, we borrowed 37.8 million on our revolving credit facility during the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared to payments of 15.8 million in the prior year period. See below for further details on the significant components of our debt. 
 Our available liquidity, including our cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our committed credit facilities, stood at 1.44 billion and 1.36 billion as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 During the quarter ended August 31, 2022, we amended our 1.3 billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which was set to expire on October 31, 2023. The amendment extended the expiration date to August 1, 2027 and increased the borrowing capacity to 1.35 billion. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at either the base rate or benchmark interest rate (i.e. the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD denominated debt), as defined, at our option, plus a spread determined by our debt rating. The Revolving Credit Facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans, which are comparatively short-term loans used for working capital purposes and letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is available to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital and capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage covenant (i.e. Net Leverage Ratio) and interest coverage ratio, which are calculated in accordance with the terms as defined by the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the leverage covenant, we may not permit our leverage ratio for total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the four most recent fiscal quarters to exceed 3.75 to 1.00. During certain periods and per the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, this ratio may be increased to 4.25 to 1.00 upon delivery of a notice to our lender requesting an increase to our maximum leverage or in connection with certain material acquisitions. The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio for EBITDA to interest expense is 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended using EBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in our Revolving Credit Facility, including the Net Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio covenants. At that date, our Net Leverage Ratio was 1.54 to 1.00, while our Interest 
 27 

Coverage Ratio was 10.95 to 1.00. As of August 31, 2024, we had 956.6 million of borrowing availability on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Our access to funds under our Revolving Credit Facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to the Revolving Credit Facility to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our Revolving Credit Facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others . 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program 
 As of August 31, 2024, we did not have an outstanding balance under our AR Program, compared to the maximum availability of 250.0 million. The maximum availability under the AR Program is 250.0 million, but availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be able to fully access the 250.0 million of funding available under the AR Program. 
 The AR Program contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary default and termination provisions. Our failure to comply with the covenants described above and other covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under that agreement, entitling the lenders to, among other things, declare the entire amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately. The instruments governing our other outstanding indebtedness generally include cross-default provisions that provide that, under certain circumstances, an event of default that results in acceleration of our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility will entitle the holders of such other indebtedness to declare amounts outstanding immediately due and payable. See Revolving Credit Agreement above for details on our compliance with all significant financial covenants at August 31, 2024. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 See Note 9, Stock Repurchase Program, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further detail surrounding our stock repurchase program. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet financings. We have no subsidiaries that are not included in our financial statements, nor do we have any interests in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities that are not reflected in our financial statements. 
 OTHER MATTERS 
 Environmental Matters 
 Environmental obligations continue to be appropriately addressed and based upon the latest available information, it is not anticipated that the outcome of such matters will materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates set forth above describe our method of establishing and adjusting environmental-related accruals and should be read in conjunction with this disclosure. For additional information, refer to Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The foregoing discussion includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. These forward-looking statements, or other statements made by us, are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors (including those specified below), which are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond our control. As a result, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any such forward-looking statements. These uncertainties and factors include (a) global and regional markets and general economic conditions, including uncertainties surrounding the volatility in financial markets, the availability of capital and the viability of banks and other financial institutions; (b) the prices, supply and availability of raw materials, including assorted pigments, resins, solvents, and other natural gas- and oil-based materials; packaging, including plastic and metal containers; and transportation services, including fuel surcharges; (c) continued growth in demand for our products; (d) legal, environmental and litigation risks inherent in our businesses and risks related to the adequacy of our insurance coverage for such matters; (e) the effect of changes in interest rates; (f) the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates upon our foreign operations; (g) the effect of non-currency risks of investing in and conducting operations in foreign countries, including those relating to domestic and international political, social, economic and regulatory factors; (h) risks and uncertainties associated with our ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities; (i) the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, and the risks of failing to meet any other objectives of our improvement plans; (j) risks related to the adequacy of our contingent liability reserves; (k) risks relating to a public health crisis similar to the Covid pandemic; (l) risks related to acts of war similar to the Russian invasion of Ukraine; (m) risks related to the transition or physical impacts of climate change and other natural disasters or meeting sustainability-related voluntary goals or regulatory requirements; (n) risks related to our or our third parties' use of technology including artificial intelligence, data breaches and data privacy violations; (o) the shift to remote work and online purchasing and the impact that has on residential and commercial real estate construction; and (p) other risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, as the same may be updated from time to time. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the filing date of this document. 
 ITEM 3.	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in raw materials costs, interest rates and foreign exchange rates since we fund our operations through long- and short-term borrowings and conduct our business in a variety of foreign currencies. There were no material potential changes in our exposure to these market risks since May 31, 2024. 
 ITEM 4.	 CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of August 31, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ), have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 29 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1.	 LEGA L PROCEEDINGS 
 Environmental Proceedings 
 Like other companies participating in similar lines of business, some of our subsidiaries are identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar local environmental statutes or are participating in the cost of certain clean-up efforts or other remedial actions relating to environmental matters. Our share of such costs to date, however, has not been material and management believes that these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024. 
 As permitted by SEC rules, and given the size of our operations, we have elected to adopt a quantitative threshold for environmental proceedings of 1 million. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any matters that exceed this threshold and meet the definition for disclosure. 
 ITEM 1A.	 RI SK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the other risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. 
 ITEM 2.	 UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
