 The Company enters into various commodity derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps and other agreements. The fair value of the Company s commodity derivatives is determined using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments on the CBOT. The Company estimates the fair market value of their finished goods and raw materials inventories using the market price quotations of similar forward futures contracts listed on the CBOT and adjusts for the local market adjustments derived from other grain terminals in our area. 
 The Company considers the carrying amount of significant classes of financial instruments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, including cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, to be reasonable estimates of fair value due to their length or maturity. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt approximates the carrying value. The interest rates on the long-term debt are similar to rates the Company would be able to obtain currently in the market. 
 The Company has patronage investments in other cooperatives and common and preferred stock holdings in privately held entities. There is no market for their patronage credits or the entity s common and preferred holdings, and it is impracticable to estimate the fair value of the Company s investments. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at the original cost plus the amount of patronage earnings allocated to the Company, less any cash distributions received.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are identified in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We are not under any duty to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report, nor do we guarantee future results or performance or what future business conditions will be like. We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. 
 Executive Overview and Summary 
 Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30th decreased from 50.9 million in 2023 to 11.5 million in 2024. While several factors contributed to this reduction, the primary factor was a sharp decrease in demand for soybean oil. Demand for oil from the food market sector remained steady, but demand from the biofuels sector dropped significantly during the first quarter of 2024. An over-production of renewable diesel and a corresponding reduction in renewable fuel credits resulted in sharply lower margins for biofuel producers. Biofuel producers responded by slowing production and shifting demand away from soybean oil to lower-priced feedstocks such as imported used cooking oil. Other factors contributing to the net income reduction included a decrease in CBOT board margins and an extended shutdown at the Volga plant during the third quarter. The Volga plant underwent the largest upgrade since its inception, as a new desolventizer toaster, dryer and cooler (DTDC) was installed to replace an aging unit, which we believe will improve efficiencies and position the plant for future growth in crush capacity. 
 As the year closes, we expect to see financial improvements for the fourth quarter due to a large, sound quality local soybean crop and elevated board crush values. Yet, the oil market will continue to provide challenges as uncertainty over implementation of new biofuels-related programs, such as 45Z, make it difficult to forecast demand from the biofuels sector. 
 The High Plains Processing plant near Mitchell, South Dakota, which we co-own through our subsidiaries, continues to take shape. Construction is on schedule, and equipment deliveries are nearly complete. The upcoming winter weather conditions will ultimately determine the final completion date. Barring a difficult winter or construction delays, the plant is scheduled to commence operations next fall.

 Revenue Revenue decreased by 46.3 million, or 26.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due to decreases in the average sales price of soybean products and quantity of soybeans processed. The average price of soybean oil decreased 28.9 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a decrease in demand. Soybean oil demand from the energy sector dropped dramatically in 2024 as refining margins for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers came under pressure from overproduction, which led to production slowdowns at some locations. In addition, imports of used cooking oil and other feedstocks flooded the market with lower-priced alternatives to soybean oil. Average soybean meal prices declined by 11.9 from 2023 following the return of Argentine processors to the global export market and an increase in U.S. soybean production in 2024. In 2023, we benefited from a strong soybean meal export market largely due to a severe drought in Argentina which has since shifted in 2024. In addition, we processed 12.8 fewer soybeans in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, which decreased the volume of soybean products available for sale to our customers. The reduction in production was due to an extended shutdown of our Volga location to install our new DTDC. 
 Gross Profit/Loss Gross profit decreased by 17.8 million, or 88.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to declining board crush margins caused by a decrease in demand for soybean oil and an increase in global soybean meal supply which negatively affected U.S. export sales including ours. 
 Operating Expenses Administrative expenses, including all selling, general and administrative expenses, decreased approximately 267,000, or 17.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a decrease in labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional and related costs associated with the start-up of the High Plains Processing plant. 
 Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 891,000, or 122.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to a 36.5 million increase in borrowings from our lines of credit with our senior lender, CoBank. The average debt level was 73.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36.5 million during the same period in 2023. Debt levels increased primarily to fund our investment commitment into the High Plains Processing plant through our subsidiaries. 
 Other Non-Operating Income Other non-operating income (expense), including patronage dividend income, increased 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in other non-operating income was due to a 243,000 increase in interest income which we received from the deposit of investment proceeds received by our subsidiaries in connection with their equity financing of the High Plains Processing plant. 
 20 

Net Income/Loss During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net income of 23,400 compared to 18.4 million for the same period in 2023. The 18.4 million decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross margins. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 of Revenue of Revenue Revenue 428,623,435 100.0 533,767,903 100.0 Cost of revenues (410,448,567) (95.8) (476,890,661) (89.3) Gross profit 18,174,868 4.2 56,877,242 10.7 Operating expenses (4,391,015) (1.0) (4,508,549) (0.8) Interest expense (4,992,342) (1.2) (2,705,266) (0.5) Other non-operating income (expense) 4,362,430 1.0 1,547,211 0.3 Net income 13,153,941 3.1 51,210,638 9.6 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities 1,625,738 0.4 321,031 0.1 Net income attributable to Company 11,528,203 2.7 50,889,607 9.5 
 Revenue Revenue decreased by 105.1 million, or 19.7 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in the average sales price of soybean products. The average price of soybean oil decreased 23.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a decrease in demand. Soybean oil demand from the energy sector dropped dramatically in 2024 as refining margins for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers came under intense pressure from overproduction which led to production slowdowns at some locations. In addition, imports of used cooking oil and other feedstocks flooded the market with lower-priced alternatives to soybean oil. Average soybean meal prices declined by 13.8 from 2023 following the return of Argentine processors to the global export market after a severe drought in Argentina in 2023. 
 Gross Profit/Loss Gross profit decreased by 38.7 million, or 68.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to declining board crush margins caused by a decrease in demand for soybean oil and an increase in global soybean meal supply which negatively affected U.S. export sales including ours. 
 Operating Expenses Administrative expenses, including all selling, general and administrative expenses, decreased approximately 118,000, or 2.6 , during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to a decrease in labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by increased professional and related costs associated with the start-up of the High Plains Processing plant. 
 Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 2.3 million, or 84.5 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to a 28.0 million increase in borrowings from our lines of credit with our senior lender, CoBank. The average debt level was 79.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 51.0 million during the same period in 2023. Debt levels increased mainly to fund our investment commitment into the High Plains Processing plant through our subsidiaries. 
 Other Non-Operating Income Other non-operating income (expense), including patronage dividend income, increased 2.8 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in other non-operating income was due to a 2.7 million increase in interest income which we received from the deposit of investment proceeds received by our subsidiaries in connection with their equity financing of the High Plains Processing plant. 
 21 

Net Income/Loss During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net income of 11.5 million, compared to 50.9 million for the same period in 2023. The 39.4 million decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross margins. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings from our two revolving lines of credit, which are discussed in the section titled Indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of approximately 59.1 million, compared to 129.9 million on September 30, 2023. Working capital decreased between periods primarily due to expenditures related to the construction and development of the High Plains Processing plant near Mitchell, South Dakota, which we have a controlling ownership stake through our subsidiaries. We acquired a majority ownership stake in High Plains Partners by contributing cash, property, and various construction and development rights for the project. High Plains Partners, in turn, contributed the cash, property, and rights to its subsidiary, HPP SD Holdings, which owns the plant through its wholly-owned subsidiary, High Plains Processing. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities 21,222,616 69,255,641 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (102,876,195) (52,921,721) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 68,038,924 45,228,050 
 Cash Flows Provided By (Used For) Operations 
 The 48.0 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was largely due to a 38.1 million decrease in net income. 
 Cash Flows Used For Investing Activities 
 The 50.0 million increase in cash flows used for investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a 49.8 million increase in expenditures for purchases of various property and equipment used for the construction and development of the High Plains Processing plant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 102.6 million on purchases of property and equipment, compared to 52.8 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Cash Flows Provided By Financing Activities 
 The 22.8 million increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was principally due to a 51.9 million increase in net proceeds on borrowings. Net proceeds on borrowings increased by 55.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.1 million during the same period in 2023. Partially offsetting the increase was a 27.6 million decrease in investment proceeds received and a 3.0 million increase in cash distributions to our members during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries received 57.5 million in investment proceeds in connection with their equity financing, which were subsequently contributed for the construction and development of the High Plains Processing plant, compared to 85.1 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Indebtedness 
 We hold three lines of credit with CoBank, our primary lender, to meet the short and long-term needs of our operations. The first credit line is a revolving long-term loan. Under this loan, we may borrow funds, as needed, up to the credit line maximum, or 12.0 million, and then pay down the principal whenever excess cash is available. Repaid amounts may be borrowed up to the available credit line. The available credit line decreases by 0.6 million every six months until the credit line s maturity on March 20, 2028, at which time a balloon payment for the remaining balance is due. We pay a 0.40 annual commitment fee on any funds not borrowed. The principal balance outstanding on the revolving term loan was 0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Under this loan, there were 10.2 million of additional funds available to borrow as of September 30, 2024. 
 22 

The second credit line is a revolving working capital (seasonal) loan. The primary purpose of this loan is to finance our operating needs. We may borrow up to 85.0 million until the loan's maturity on December 1, 2024. We pay a 0.20 annual commitment fee on any funds not borrowed; however, we have the option to reduce the credit line during any given commitment period listed in the credit agreement to avoid the commitment fee. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no principal balance outstanding on this credit line, thus allowing us to borrow an additional 85.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The third line of credit is a multiple advance note payable. The primary purpose of this note is to finance our investment and ownership in the High Plains Processing plant through our subsidiaries and for other larger capital projects. The maximum we may borrow under this note is 90.0 million. Under this loan, principal payments of 4.5 million are made every six months which begin on October 20, 2024 and end on the date of maturity, March 20, 2028, at which time a balloon payment is due for the remaining balance. The principal balance outstanding on this note was 55.0 million and 0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Under this note, there were 35.0 million of funds available to borrow as of September 30, 2024. 
 The revolving, seasonal and multiple advance loans with CoBank are set up with a variable rate option. The variable rate is set daily by CoBank. We also have a fixed rate option on all three loans, allowing us to fix rates for any period between one day and the entire commitment period. The annual interest rate on the revolving term and multiple advance loans was 7.38 and 7.85 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the seasonal loan was 7.08 and 7.55 , respectively. We were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the loans as of September 30, 2024.

 23 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Commodities Risk Risk Management. To reduce the price change risks associated with holding fixed-price commodity positions, we generally take opposite and offsetting positions by entering into commodity futures contracts (either a straight or options futures contract) on a regulated commodity futures exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade. While hedging activities reduce the risk of loss from changing market prices, such activities also limit the gain potential which otherwise could result from these significant fluctuations in market prices. Our policy is generally to maintain a hedged position within limits, but we can be long or short at any time. Our profitability is primarily derived from margins on soybeans processed, not from hedging transactions. Our management does not anticipate that hedging activities will have a significant impact on future operating results or liquidity. Hedging arrangements do not protect against the nonperformance of a cash contract. 
 At any one time, our inventory and purchase contracts for delivery to our facility may be substantial. We have risk management policies and procedures that include net position limits. They are defined by commodity and include both trader and management limits. This policy and procedure trigger a review by management when any trader is outside of position limits. The position limits are reviewed at least annually with the board of managers. We monitor current market conditions and may expand or reduce the limits in response to changes in those conditions. 
 An adverse change in market prices would not materially affect our profitability since we generally take opposite and offsetting positions by entering into commodity futures and forward contracts as economic hedges of price risk. 
 Foreign Currency Risk. We conduct essentially all of our business in U.S. dollars and have minimal direct risk regarding foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations do, however, impact the ability of foreign buyers to purchase U.S. agricultural products and the competitiveness of and demand for U.S. agricultural products compared to the same products offered by foreign suppliers. 
 An adverse change in market prices would not materially affect our profitability since we generally take opposite and offsetting positions by entering into commodity futures and forward contracts as economic hedges of price risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk. We manage exposure to interest rate changes by using variable-rate loan agreements with fixed-rate options. Long-term loan agreements can utilize the fixed option through maturity; however, the revolving ability to pay down and borrow back would be eliminated once the funds were fixed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 0 in fixed-rate debt outstanding and 185.2 million of variable-rate lines of credit. Interest rate changes impact the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows. Assuming other variables remain constant, a 1.0 increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt could have an estimated impact on profitability of approximately 1.9 million per year. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be named as a defendant in legal proceedings related to various issues, including without limitation, workers compensation claims, tort claims, or contractual disputes. We carry insurance that provides protection against general commercial liability claims, claims against our 
 24 

directors, officer and employees, business interruption, automobile liability, and workers' compensation. We are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings and are not aware of any potential claims. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors .
