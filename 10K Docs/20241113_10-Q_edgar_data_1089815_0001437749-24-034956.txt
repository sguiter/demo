compared to in fiscal year 2022 and a net loss of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit in stockholders equity of , cash and cash equivalents of and working capital of . In addition, the Company currently does not have access to capital through a line of credit nor other readily available sources of capital. Together, these factors raised substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at September 30, 2024. However, management has considered its plans to continue the Company as a going concern, concentrating on the establishment and operation of managed health care plans. As noted above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of million in support of this business opportunity through the sale of its Common Stock in a private placement and believes it has access to additional capital in fiscal 2025. Additionally, the Company believes that these activities and resulting expenses can be managed to the level of cash resources on hand and expected to be raised. Management believes its plan alleviates the substantial doubt, that it will be successful in its planned business initiatives and will be able to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to the Company at that time or, if available, can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company. 

Pursuant to accounting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. Accordingly, these statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s most recent annual Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Consolidated results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be achieved for full fiscal years. The only change to the Company s equity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was net loss for the periods and issuance of common stock during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company applies the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810, Consolidation to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires noncontrolling interests to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity and purchases and sales of equity interests, that do not result in a change in control, to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests are to be included in net (loss) income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in net (loss) income. 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with two different accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 and 2) Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842, Leases . However, the Company is not currently generating revenue. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company held an initial closing of a private placement of shares of the Company s common stock to raise gross proceeds of not less than and up to , at a price of per share. Since the initial closing, the Company amended the terms of the private placement to raise up to maximum on April 15, 2024 and amended further on July 10, 2024 to increase the maximum pursuant to the private placement to . As of September 30, 2024 the Company raised an aggregate of . As a result of these issuances, as of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock. 

Basic loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net loss and the denominator is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

The Company invested initially and had a interest in BOP and BOPRE. In February 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in BOP. 

In June 2012, BOPRE purchased an additional of Boca West IMP from another investor bringing its total interest to . BOPRE accounts for this investment under the cost method since it does not exercise significant influence over Boca West, IMP. 

During the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, several investors relinquished part of their ownership interest in BOPRE, and those interests were distributed among the remaining investors in relationship to their percentages owned. During 2021 and 2022, additional members relinquished their ownership to EHSHI. As a result, the Company now holds a ownership interest in BOPRE, which it accounts for under the equity method. 

In September 2024, BOPRE sold its interest in Boca West IMP to the remaining members for , resulting in a gain to the Company of during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

equity interest in UOMA. USNC was not a member of MOP at the time of formation as it was not able to participate due to the fact that USNC was not a physician. Nevertheless, USNC wished to eventually obtain an equity interest in MOP and loaned Dr. Jaime Lozano, the principal investor in MOP and a co-investor in FOP, . Dr. Lozano used these funds, along with an equal amount of his own funds (a total of ), to purchase a interest in MOP. Other investors paid a further for the remaining equity in MOP. MOP used the of financing to acquire a equity interest in UOMA. An application was filed for a waiver to allow USNC to hold an equity interest notwithstanding the physician requirement and on December 22, 2016, USNC was cleared to become a part owner of MOP. Dr. Lozano agreed to exchange half of his membership interest to USNC in settlement of the note to USNC. USNC and Dr. Lozano also agreed to share equally in providing a equity interest in MOP to an additional investor as a consulting fee for services rendered in the administration of MOP and UOMA. At December 22, 2016, USNC owned of MOP with an initial carrying value of . The Company recorded its share of losses of for the period from December 22, 2016 to December 31, 2016, against its investment which resulted in a reduction of its equity investment to . 

Due to increasing costs, continued net losses since April 2015, and reliance on related party and other debt for operating cash flows, the fair value of UOMA is less than it s carrying amount. The Company tested its investment for impairment at December 31, 2016 and determined that the investment was impaired, and an impairment loss was recorded against the entire equity balance in MOP, as well as loans from EHSHI and USNC to MOP and UOMA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s equity in loss of MOP was but was not recorded due to prior losses.

equity interest in CBOP. Beginning in October of 2017, CBOP began paying the remainder of the costs associated with opening the center. CBOP had no assets at the end of 2017. The medical center opened and treated its first patient in January of 2018. 

Effective November 15, 2019, FOP transferred to, and CBOP assumed, a loan with BB T bank, that it had entered in order to finance the purchase of equipment and build out of the new center, as well as the associated property and equipment. In addition, CBOP and BB T agreed to reduce the monthly loan repayments for the next nine months, and to extend the term of the loan from November 2024 to July 2025. In July 2020 CBOP and BB T further agreed to reduce the monthly payments for the life of the loan and extended the loan to July of 2027. 

In June 2020, CBOP made a capital call to its members. UNSC converted previously made advances totaling into equity in CBOP to meet its capital requirement, and other members contributed in cash. The remaining capital contributions are not expected to be met and, accordingly, the Company s equity interest in CBOP increased to in June 2020.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s equity in loss of CBOP was and , respectively, but was not recorded due to prior losses. 

Due to loans made to CBOP, CBOP is considered to be a variable interest entity of the Company. However, as the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of CBOP, since it does not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect CBOP s economic performance, the entity is not consolidated, but certain disclosures are provided herein.

of the outstanding shares of EHSHI. Effective November 27, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with the holders of these minority interests in EHSHI, which resulted in making EHSHI s wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the former minority holders of EHSHI owners of the Company immediately following the exchange. As a result of the November 27, 2023, transaction, shares of the Company s Common Stock were issued, but pending certification, bringing the total outstanding to shares as of that date. Since that date, the Company raised an additional through the private sale of shares, of which have yet to be issued, bringing the total outstanding to shares as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company has determined that its best opportunity for long term success is to concentrate its efforts and resources on establishing a managed care organization that will develop and operate Medicare Advantage plans for seniors in California, and other areas in the U.S. including Nevada, and to pursue other opportunities related to this activity. 

In furtherance of this plan, EHSHI recently formed Elite Health Plan of Nevada, Inc. to apply for a license to operate a Medicare Advantage plan in Nevada and Elite Health Plan, Inc. has submitted documentation for a Knox-Keene license to offer managed health care plans in California. Elite Heath Plan, Inc. and Elite health Plan of Nevada, Inc., both owned by EHSHI and managed and operated in a similar manner, are collectively referred to herein as Elite Health. In each of Nevada and California, Elite Health has taken preliminary steps toward identifying a network of providers who are well-versed in Medicare Advantage plans and addressing the healthcare needs of seniors in the communities in which they practice. Elite Health currently has no revenue and will not be able to generate revenue for an indefinite period while it seeks to obtain a license to operate a Medicare Advantage plan in California and then other states. The success of Elite Health will depend, in part, on timely obtaining all necessary approvals and gaining access to a sufficient network of providers and enrolling a critical level of subscribers. There can be no assurance that the Company and Elite Health will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to operate Medicare Advantage plans in any jurisdiction or be effective in establishing the network of providers and developing the systems required to operate a managed care business.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of 1,299,000 for the first nine months of 2024 were 149 higher than the 522,000 incurred during the comparable period in 2023, due mostly to the start-up costs for Elite Health in 2024. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 101,000 gain from its investment in unconsolidated entities compared to a loss of 266,000 during the same period in 2023 due to the gain on the sale of the Company s interest in Boca West IMP.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 1,034,000 as compared to 670,000 for the same period a year earlier. The net loss was primarily due to the lack of revenue. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s primary sources of liquidity are from equity transactions discussed below. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 988,000 as compared to 571,000 for the same period a year earlier. This change is primarily due to the Company using cash to invest in the Elite business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 268,000 of distributed earnings from unconsolidated entities as compared to 23,000 in the first nine months of 2023. 

On January 16, 2024, the Company held an initial closing of a private placement of shares of the Company s common stock to raise gross proceeds of not less than 1,000,000, and up to 2,000,000, at a price of 0.50 per share. Since the initial closing, the Company amended the terms of the private placement to raise up to 3,000,000 maximum on April 15, 2024 and amended further on July 10, 2024 to increase the maximum pursuant to the private placement to 5,000,000. As of September 30, 2024 the Company raised an aggregate of 4,050,000. As a result of these issuances, as of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding 17,384,924 shares of the Company s Common Stock. 

For this sale of securities in connection with private placement, no general solicitation was used, no commissions were paid, all participants in the private placement were accredited investors, and the Company relied on the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.

The Company presently intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement principally to execute the plan of Elite Health to establish a managed care organization that will operate as a Medicare Advantage plan for seniors. 

In fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 816,000 compared to 1,572,000 in fiscal year 2022 and a net loss of 1,034,000 and 670,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit in stockholders equity of 3,424,000, cash and cash equivalents of 3,173,000 and working capital of 3,098,000. In addition, the Company currently does not have access to capital through a line of credit nor other readily available sources of capital. Together, these factors raised substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern at September 30, 2024. However, management has considered its plans to continue the Company as a going concern, concentrating on the establishment and operation of managed health care plans. As noted above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of 4,050,000 million in support of this business opportunity through the sale of its Common Stock in a private placement and believes it has access to additional capital in fiscal 2025. Additionally, the Company believes that these activities and resulting expenses can be managed to the level of cash resources on hand and expected to be raised. Management believes its plan alleviates the substantial doubt, that it will be successful in its planned business initiatives and will be able to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to the Company at that time or, if available, can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company. 

Risk Factors 

We desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The factors listed under the caption Risk Factors in Annual Report on our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, have affected or could affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. Investors should carefully consider these risks and speculative factors inherent in and affecting our business and an investment in our common stock. 

Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This document contains such "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, particularly statements anticipating future growth in revenues and cash flow. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "targets," "intends," "plans," "believes," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify such forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements are based on management's present expectations about future events. As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and the Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, future events or otherwise.

The Company operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment and in businesses that are dependent on our ability to: achieve profitability; increase revenues; sustain our current level of operations; maintain satisfactory relations with business partners; attract and retain key personnel; maintain and expand our strategic alliances; and protect our intellectual property. The Company's actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors. New risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the Company's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated include the following: 

Uncertainties relating to our ability to successfully implement our strategy of developing a Medicare Advantage plan under out Elite Health subsidiaries; 

Uncertainty over our ability to achieve a Medicare Advantage license in California in a timely manner, acquire managed health consumers in California, expand consumer enrollment beyond this initial state, or diversify and expand our portfolio of products and services, our business and results of operations will be significantly impaired; 

Our ability to raise capital in the future on satisfactory terms; 

Our financial condition and liquidity; 

Uncertainty over our ability to successfully implement management's plan to improve liquidity, including the ability to manage costs, systems and growth; 

All forward looking statements should be considered in the context of the risks and other factors described above and in "Risk Factors" (Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023), "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" (Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023), and "Management s Discussion and Analysis" (Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

Investors should also be aware that while the Company might, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Company's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, investors should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts or others contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company.

In addition, the Company s overall financial strategy, including growth in operations, maintaining financial ratios and strengthening the balance sheet, could be adversely affected by increased interest rates, construction delays or other transactions, economic slowdowns and changes in the Company s plans, strategies and intentions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We do realize that we are a very small company and as a small company with only the officers and directors participating in the day to day management, with the ability to override controls, each officer and director has multiple positions and responsibilities that would normally be distributed among several employees in larger organizations with adequate segregation of duties to ensure the appropriate checks and balances. Because the Company does not currently have a separate chief financial officer, the Chief Executive Officer performs these functions with the support of one of the Company s outside directors who assists in the reporting and disclosure process (the Lead Director ). 

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report for the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company. 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company. 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following material weakness as of September 30, 2024: The Company did not maintain sufficient qualified personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and in internal controls over financial reporting commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, effective controls were not designed and in place to ensure that the Company maintained, or had access to, appropriate resources with adequate experience and expertise in the area of financial reporting for transactions such as investments in unconsolidated entities, related party receivables, impairments, lease accounting, accounting for business combinations, income taxes, and to properly assess the application of new accounting pronouncements. The Company is in the process of developing efficient approaches to remediate this material weakness. To do this in a cost-effective manner, considering the current extent of the Company s operations, management is making arrangements with consultants and advisors to assist on an as-needed basis.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

While there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, management is in the process of developing plans to remediate the material weakness identified above.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On January 16, 2024, the Company held an initial closing of a private placement of shares of the Company s common stock to raise gross proceeds of not less than 1,000,000, and up to 2,000,000, at a price of 0.50 per share. Since the initial closing, the Company amended the terms of the private placement to raise up to 3,000,000 maximum on April 15, 2024 and amended further on July 10, 2024 to increase the maximum pursuant to the private placement to 5,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company raised an aggregate of 4,050,000. As a result of these issuances, as of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding 17,384,924 shares of the Company s Common Stock. 

For this sale of securities in connection with private placement, no general solicitation was used, no commissions were paid, all participants in the private placement were accredited investors, and the Company relied on the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act with respect to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. 

The Company presently intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement principally to execute the plan of Elite Health to establish a managed care organization that will operate as a Medicare Advantage plan for seniors.
