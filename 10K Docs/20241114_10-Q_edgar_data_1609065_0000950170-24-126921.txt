shares of its Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock ("Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock") to an equal number of shares of its newly-created Series A Non-Voting Common Stock. The conversion, which was effective on June 28, 2021, represented 100 of the Company's Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of the conversion and retired the Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock in perpetuity. The Company has voting common stock, non-voting common stock and a warrant that are all eligible to participate in dividends equal to the voting common stock dividends on a per share basis. Securities that participate in dividends, such as the Company s non-voting common stock and warrant, are considered participating securities . The Company calculates net income available to voting common shareholders using the two-class method required for capital structures that include participating securities. In applying the two-class method, basic net income per share was calculated by dividing net income (less any dividends on participating securities) by the weighted average number of shares of voting common stock and participating securities outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share may include the additional effect of other securities, if dilutive, in which case the dilutive effect of such securities is calculated by applying either the two-class method or the Treasury Stock method to the assumed exercise or vesting of potentially dilutive common shares. The method yielding the more dilutive result is ultimately reported for the applicable period. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted stock units. Unallocated common shares held by the employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") are not included in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per common share until they are committed to be released to plan participants. Anti-dilutive shares are common stock equivalents with average exercise prices in excess of t he weighted average market price for the period presented. Anti-dilutive stock options, not included in the computation below, were - - for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an d September 30, 2023, respectively.)

Excluding the effects of changes in the characteristics of individual debt securities that potentially give rise to credit losses, as described below, the fair market value of a debt security as of a particular measurement date is highly dependent upon prevailing market and economic environmental factors at the measurement date relative to the prevailing market and economic environmental factors present at the time the debt security was acquired. The most significant market and environmental factors include, but are not limited to (1) the general level of interest rates, (2) the relationship between shorter-term interest rates and longer-term interest rates (referred to as the slope or "shape"

The resultant million total improvement in the fair value of the AFS investment portfolio's aggregate fair value, relative to its aggregate amortized historical cost, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to changes in the interest rate environment (the general interest rate level and the relationships between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates, known as the 'yield curve') that occurred in that period. These changes in aggregate fair value relative to aggregate amortized historical cost that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not represent any changes in credit loss estimations within the portfolio.

These gains on the extinguishment of the hedging swap contracts are reported as a reduction of the carrying value of the hedged loan pools and will be recognized as an enhancement to the reported yield on those loan pools over the original contractual life of the hedging swap contracts. The unamortized portion of these gains totaled at September 30, 2024. 

 (2) related to the remaining unpaid portion of the original loan pool, of which has currently been collected by the servicer from underlying borrowers and is being held in a segregated account by the Bankruptcy Court and approximately remains due from borrowers under the scheduled repayment terms of their original loan agreements. The Bank s management expects to ultimately collect substantially all of these funds and does not consider the loans in this pool to be impaired at September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses (the "ACL") related to these pools were million a nd million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of million and million, respectively, have been pledged by the Company to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY under a blanket collateral agreement to secure the Company s line of credit and term borrowings. For additional information related to these pools, please see Note 7 Allowance For Credit Losses. Loan Origination / Risk Management The Company s lending policies and procedures are presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2024 and have not changed. As part of the execution of the Company s overall balance sheet management strategies, the Bank will acquire participating interests in loans originated by unrelated third parties on an occasional basis. The purchase of participations in loans that are originated by third parties only occurs after the completion of thorough pre-acquisition due diligence. Loans in which the Company acquires a participating interest are determined to meet, in all material respects, the Company s internal underwriting policies, including credit and collateral suitability thresholds, prior to acquisition. In addition, the financial condition of the originating financial institutions, which are generally retained as the ongoing loan servicing provider for participations acquired by the Bank, are analyzed prior to the acquisition of the participating interests and monitored on a regular basis thereafter for the life of those interests. To develop and document a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company has divided the loan portfolio into portfolio segments, each with different risk characteristics but with similar methodologies for assessing risk. Each portfolio segment is broken down into loan classes where appropriate. Loan classes contain unique measurement attributes, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and assessing risk that are necessary to develop the allowance for credit losses. Unique characteristics such as borrower type, loan type, collateral type, and risk characteristics define each class.

Management has reviewed its loan portfolio and determined that, to the best of its knowledge, no material exposure exists to sub-prime or other high-risk residential mortgages. The Company is not in the practice of originating these types of loans. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received within thirty days of the payment due date. Loans are placed on nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal and interest has become 90 days past due or when management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan may be currently performing.

At September 30, 2024, the Bank's nonperforming loans represented of total loans, with an aggregate outstanding balance of million, as compared to loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million at December 31, 2023. This decrease in nonaccrual balances of million was primarily the result of a decrease in consumer loans related to charge-offs totaling million for purchased loan pools, and a decrease in residential mortgage loans, offset by an increase in commercial loans of million. Management is clo sely monitoring all nonaccrual loans and has incorporated its current estimate of the ultimate collectability of these loans into the reported allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024. The measurement of individually evaluated loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. The Company utilizes the Discounted Cash Flow DCF method for its pooled segment calculation. The DCF method implements a probability of default with loss given default and loss

million in provision for credit losses ("PCL") for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, we recorde d million i n provision for credit losses compared to million in the first nine months of the prior year. The increase in provision for credit losses in in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same three and nine month periods in 2023, primarily resulted from a comprehensive loan portfolio review that the Bank elected to undertake as part of its commitment to continuously improve its credit risk management approach. This comprehensive review included a detailed review of our originated loan portfolios as well as a reevaluation of certain purchased loan pools in light of observed changes in consumer loan repayment behavior, particularly for purchased consumer installment loan pools secured by liens on residential solar equipment installations Solar Loan Pools ), which are collateralized by security interests and validly executed liens on the installed equipment related to the loans. In general, these Solar Loan Pools are repaid through normal contractual amortization or voluntary prepayments, including discharges through full repayment when the related residential property is sold or refinanced. In reevaluating the current and expected performance of the four purchased Solar Loan Pools, management determined that these pools started to experience prepayment rates that are slower and have also exhibited higher charge-off rates than originally expected. As a result, management recorded an increase of approximately million to the PCL for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 to properly record a current estimate of the lifetime losses related to the Solar Loan Pools. Management's comprehensive review of the originated loan portfolio considered all aspects of reviewed credits, including collectability, specific reserves, and collateral. As a result, management recorded an increase of million to the PCL for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, to properly reserve for these loans. Following this comprehensive review, the Company recorded net charge offs of million in the third quarter of 2024 and reduced nonperforming loans to million at September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on September 30, 2024 represented and of total and nonperforming loans, respectively. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a PCL decrease of f or reserves related to securities classified as held-to-maturity and a decrease to t he PCL for unfunded commitments, respectively. The provision in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was reflective of the qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the ACL and changes in the levels of delinquent and nonaccrual loans. The third quarter PCL reflects an addition to reserves considering asset quality metrics.

The Company s methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses includes an analysis of qualitative factors that are added to the historical loss rates in arriving at the total allowance for credit losses needed for this general pool of loans. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Changes in national and local economic trends; 

 The rate of growth in the portfolio; 

 Trends of delinquencies and nonaccrual balances; 

 Changes in loan policy; and 

 Changes in lending management experience and related staffing. 

 Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. These qualitative factors, applied to each product class, make the evaluation inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for credit losses analysis and calculation.

Collateral Dependent Disclosures The Company has certain loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or sale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the type of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral dependent loans: Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. 

 Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by a second mortgage. 

 Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages on residential real estate property. 

 Consumer loans are generally secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Some consumer loans are unsecured and have no underlying collateral.

million and an aggregate fair market value of million as of Sept ember 30, 2024. These securities have an aggregate valuation that is determined using published net asset values (NAV) derived by an analysis of the securities underlying assets. These securities are comprised primarily of broadly-diversified real estate holdings and are traded in secondary markets on an infrequent basis. While these securities are redeemable at least annually through tender offers made by respective issuers, the liquidation value of these securities may be below stated NAVs and also subject to restrictions as to the amount that can be redeemed at any single scheduled redemption. The Company anticipates that these securities will be redeemed by respective issuers on indeterminate future dates as a consequence of the ultimate liquidation strategies employed by the managers of these portfolios. The Company also holds two limited partnership investments managed by an unrelated third party with an aggregate fair market value of million at September 30, 2024. The investments are funds comprised of marketable equity securities, primarily issued by community banks and financial technology companies. These investments are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period using Level 1 valuation techniques. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded as components of periodic net income in the period in which the changes occur. Interest rate derivatives: The fair value of the interest rate derivatives, characterized as either fair value or cash flow hedges, are calculated based on a discounted cash flow model. All future floating rate cash flows are projected and both floating rate and fixed rate cash flows are discounted to the valuation date. The benchmark interest rate curve utilized for projecting cash flows and applying appropriate discount rates is built by obtaining publicly available third party market quotes for various swap maturity terms. Individually evaluated loans: Specifically-identified loans are those loans in which the Company has measured impairment based on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the discounted value of expected future cash flows. Fair value is generally determined based upon market value evaluations by third parties of the properties and/or estimates by management of working capital collateral or discounted cash flows based upon expected proceeds. These appraisals may include up to three approaches to value: the sales comparison approach, the income approach (for income-producing property), and the cost approach. Management modifies the appraised values, if needed, to take into account recent developments in the market or other factors, such as, changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition. Such modifications to the appraised values could result in lower valuations of such collateral. Estimated costs to sell are based on current amounts of disposal costs for similar assets. These measurements are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Specifically-identified loans are subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustment upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment. A portion of the allowance for credit losses is allocated to specifically-identified loans if the value of such loans is deemed to be less than the unpaid balance.

There have been no transfers of assets into or out of any fair value measurement level during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Required disclosures include fair value information of financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The Company has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Company performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company s financial instruments; however, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective period-ends, and

(1) million net carrying amount of hedged assets represents the hedge-adjusted amortized cost basis of specifically-identified municipal and GSE-backed securities designated as the underlying assets for the hedging relationships. The notional amount of the designated hedges were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the derivatives (an unrealized gain, receivable from derivative counterparties) recorded in other assets resulted in a net asset position of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's participation in fair value hedging transactions increased investment security interest income by million and million in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

 (2) million net carrying amount of hedged assets represents the hedge-adjusted amortized cost of a designated pool of residential mortgages and the aggregate hedge-adjusted amortized cost of four specified purchased consumer loan pools. These pools of loans were designated as the underlying assets for the hedging relationships in which the hedged underlying asset's notional amounts were the amortized cost projected to be remaining at the end of the contractual term of the hedging instruments. The amount of the designated hedged items were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the derivatives recorded in other assets (an unrealized loss, payable to derivative counterparties) resulted in a net liability position of , recorded by the Company as a component of other assets. The Company s participation in fair value hedging transactions increased interest income by million and million, for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Details of the two loan hedging strategies, in place at September 30, 2024 are presented below: 

 a. On April 7, 2023 the Bank entered into an amortizing swap transaction with an initial notional amount of million whereby the Bank will receive the 3-month SOFR rate monthly, based on the notional amount of the swap contract at the beginning of each month until the swap transaction expires in . The notional amount of the swap declines monthly according to a predetermined amortization schedule and was million at September 30, 2024. The Bank will pay a fixed rate of to the contract's counterparty throughout the life of the contract based on each month's beginning notional balance. The fair value of this swap contract was at September 30, 2024. 

 b. On December 7, 2023, the Bank entered into five fixed-pay interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of million, whereby the Bank will receive the 3-month rate SOFR monthly until the respective maturity dates of the contracts. The contracts expire in annual increments on December 1 of 2025 million, fixed rate of ), 2026 million, fixed rate of ), 2027 million, fixed rate of ), 2028 million, fixed rate of ), and 2029 million, fixed rate of ). The fair value of these swap contracts in aggregate was negative million (a payable to the swap counterparty) at September 30, 2024. 

The Company's hedging contracts accounted for as fair value hedges, increased the yield on investment securities and loans by and , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The hedging contracts noted above, accounted for as fair value hedges, increased the yield on investment securities and loans by and , respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Total gain in comprehensive income 

On April 17, 2024 the Bank elected to settle its previously established cash flow hedges designated against million of floating-rate liabilities. This election was made in response to planned reductions in the Bank s future levels of floating rate brokered certificates of deposit. Due to increases in interest rates since the inception dates of the cash flow hedges, the Bank realized a cash basis gain of on that date, recorded for financial statement purposes, as a deferred gain in other assets. of this gain will be recognized, as a reduction of interest expense, in substantially equal monthly installments through April 30, 2026 and of this gain will be recognized, as a reduction in interest expense, in substantially equal monthly installments through April 30, 2027, which were the respective original maturity dates of the settled hedging contracts. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness, recognized at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for cash flow hedges were not material to the Company s consolidated results of operations. A portion of, or the entire amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified into current earnings should a portion of, or the entire hedge, no longer be considered effective. Management believes that the hedges will remain fully effective during the remaining term of the respective hedging contracts. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate hedging

The following is a discussion of key revenues within the scope of ASC 606 guidance: Service charges on deposit accounts Revenue is earned through insufficient funds fees, customer initiated activities or passage of time for deposit related fees, and ATM service fees. Transaction-based fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, which is the same time the Company s performance obligation is satisfied. Account maintenance fees are earned over the course of the month as the monthly maintenance performance obligation to the customer is satisfied. 

 Fee income Revenue is earned through commissions on insurance and securities sales, ATM surcharge fees, and banking house rents collected. The Company earns investment advisory fee income by providing investment management services to customers under investment management contracts. As the direction of investment management accounts is provided over time, the performance obligation to investment management customers is satisfied over time, and therefore, revenue is recognized over time. 

 Card income Card income consists of interchange fees from consumer debit card networks and other related services. Interchange rates are set by the card networks. Interchange fees are based on purchase volumes and other factors and are recognized as transactions occur. 

 Mortgage fee income and realized gain on sale of loans and foreclosed real estate Revenue from mortgage fee income and realized gain on sale of loans and foreclosed real estate is earned through the origination of residential and commercial mortgage loans, sales of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, sales of government guarantees portions of Small Business Administration loans SBA loans ), and sales of foreclosed real estate, and is earned as the transaction occurs. 

 In addition to the revenue items discussed above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-recurring gain of related to refunds received from cumulative lessor related pass-through

Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Fina ncial Condition and Results of Operations (Unaudited) 
 General 
 The Company is a Maryland corporation headquartered in Oswego, New York. The Company is 100 owned by public shareholders. The primary business of the Company is its investment in Pathfinder Bank (the "Bank"), a New York State chartered commercial bank, which is 100 owned by the Company. The Bank has two wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Pathfinder Risk Management Company, Inc. PRMC and Whispering Oaks Development Corp. All significant inter-company accounts and activity have been eliminated in consolidation. Although the Company owned, through its subsidiary PRMC, 51 of the membership interest in FitzGibbons Agency, LLC FitzGibbons or Agency ), the Company is required to consolidate 100 of FitzGibbons within the consolidated financial statements. The 49 of which the Company does not own, is accounted for separately as a noncontrolling interest within the consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2024, the Company and subsidiaries had total consolidated assets of 1.48 billion, total consolidated liabilities of 1.36 billion and shareholders' equity of 120.2 million, plus noncontrolling interest of 854,000, which represents the 49 of FitzGibbons not owned by the Company. On October 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its interest in FitzGibbons to Marshall Sterling Enterprises, Inc. Please refer to the Recent Developments section below for additional details regarding the sale of FitzGibbons. 
 The following discussion reviews the Company's financial condition at September 30, 2024 and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other period. 
 The following material under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" is written with the presumption that the users of the interim financial statements have read, or have access to, the Company's latest audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2024 the consolidated annual financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the two years then ended. Therefore, only material changes in financial condition and results of operations are discussed in the remainder of Item 2. 
 Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements concern the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, including statements preceded by, followed by or that include words or phrases such as believes, expects, anticipates, plans, trend, objective, continue, remain, pattern or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, might, can, may or similar expressions. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) general economic conditions may be less favorable than expected; (2) competitive pressures among depository institutions may increase significantly; (3) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; (4) loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and credit loss provisions may vary substantially from period to period; (5) the impact of a pandemic or other health crises and the government's 
 - 51 - 

response to such pandemic or crises on our operations as well as those of our customers and on the economy generally and in our market area specifically; (6) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (7) legislative or regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the businesses in which Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. is engaged; (8) changes and trends in the securities markets may adversely impact Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc.; (9) difficulties in integrating any businesses that we may acquire, including our recently completed acquisition of the East Syracuse branch of Berkshire Bank, which may increase our expenses and delay the achievement of any benefits that we may expect from such acquisitions; (10) the impact of reputation risk created by the developments discussed above on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity could be significant; (11) our ability to prevent or mitigate fraudulent activity and cybersecurity threats; and (12) the outcome of any future regulatory and legal investigations and proceedings may not be anticipated. 
 Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect future events or developments. 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company's consolidated quarterly financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated quarterly financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by unaffiliated third-party sources, when available. When third party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management. 
 The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the annual audited consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated quarterly financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the allowance for credit losses, deferred income taxes, pension obligations, the evaluation of investment securities for credit losses, the estimation of fair values for accounting and disclosure purposes, and the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments. These areas could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
 
 The ACL represents management's estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment on the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and environmental factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The Company establishes a specific allowance for all commercial loans in excess of the total related credit threshold of 100,000 and single borrower residential mortgage loans in excess of the total related credit threshold of 300,000 identified as being individually evaluated which are on nonaccrual and have been risk rated under the Company s risk rating system as substandard, doubtful, or loss. In addition, an accruing substandard loan could be identified as being individually evaluated. 
 
 - 52 - 

The measurement of individually evaluated loans is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses as compared to the loan carrying value. For all other loans and leases, the Company uses the general allocation methodology that establishes an allowance to estimate the lifetime incurred loss for each risk-rating category. The measurement of individually evaluated loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s position in individually evaluated loans consisted of 49 loans totaling 19.6 million. Of these loans, 16 loans, totaling 3.1 million, were valued using the present value of future cash flows method; and 33 loans, totaling 16.5 million, were valued based on a collateral analysis. For all other loans, the Company uses the general allocation methodology that establishes an allowance to estimate the lifetime incurred loss for each risk-rating category. 
 
 In estimating the ACL on loans, management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from management s estimate. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held 534.5 million in commercial real estate and commercial industrial loans (collectively, commercial loans) representing 57.9 of the Bank s entire loan portfolio. The Bank allocated 9.8 million to the ACL for these loans, including 3.7 million derived from the use of qualitative factors in the calculation. Given the concentration of ACL allocation to the total commercial loan portfolio and the significant judgments made by management in deriving the qualitative loss factors, management considers the impact that changes in judgments could have on the ACL. The ACL could increase (or decrease) by approximately 936,000, assuming a 25 negative (or positive) change within the group of qualitative factors used to determine the ACL for commercial loans. The sensitivity and related range of impacts for various judgments on the ACL is a hypothetical analysis and is used to determine management s judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at September 30, 2024 in the final recorded estimation of the ACL on loans recognized on the Statements of Financial Condition. 
 
 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences. This is attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. If current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized, a valuation allowance is established. The judgment about the level of future taxable income, including that which is considered capital, is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate typically differs from the 21 federal statutory tax rate due primarily to New York State income taxes, partially offset by tax-exempt income from specific types of investment securities and loans, bank owned life insurance, and to a much lesser degree, the utilization of low income housing tax credits. In addition, the tax effects of certain incentive stock option activity may reduce the Company s effective tax rate on a sporadic basis. 
 We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees. The plan provides defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. On May 14, 2012, we informed our employees of our decision to freeze participation and benefit accruals under the plan, primarily to reduce some of the volatility in earnings that can accompany the maintenance of a defined benefit plan. Pension and post-retirement benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions of future events; including fair value of plan assets, interest rates, and the length of time the Company will have to provide those benefits. 
 When the fair value of a security categorized as available-for-sale ("AFS") or held-to-maturity ("HTM") is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is made as to whether or not credit loss is present. Management makes a quantitative determination of potential credit loss for all HTM securities even if the risk of credit loss is considered remote and uses a best estimate threshold for securities categorized as AFS. The Company considers numerous factors when determining whether a potential credit loss exists. The principal factors considered are (1) the financial condition of the issue and (guarantor, if any) and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry or geographic 
 - 53 - 

area, (2) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, (3) any changes to the rating of the security by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization NRSRO ), and (4) the presence of contractual credit enhancements, if any, including the guarantee of the federal government or any of its agencies. 
 The Company carries all of its AFS investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported, net of tax, as an adjustment to shareholders' equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the credit-related portion of debt securities credit losses securities which are charged to earnings. The Company's ability to fully realize the value of its investments in various securities, including corporate debt securities, is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization. In evaluating the debt securities portfolio, for both AFS and HTM securities for credit losses, management considers (1) if we intend to sell the security; (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) if the present value of expected cash flows is insufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. 
 The estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets, and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities; including AFS and marketable equity investment securities, intangible assets, leases, foreclosed real estate, and the value of loan collateral when valuing loans. These are all recorded at either fair value, or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are determined based on third party sources, when available. Furthermore, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the annual audited consolidated financial statements. Fair values on our AFS securities may be influenced by a number of factors including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, and the shape of yield curves. 
 Fair values for AFS securities are obtained from unaffiliated third party pricing services. Where available, fair values are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar benchmark securities. Management made no adjustments to the fair value quotes that were provided by the pricing sources. Fair values for marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange for similar benchmark securities. The fair values of foreclosed real estate and the underlying collateral value of individually evaluated loans are typically determined based on evaluations by third parties, less estimated costs to sell. When necessary, appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions. 
 Management performs an annual evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment at each of our reporting units. Based on the results of the December 31, 2023 evaluation, management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of that date. Management will continuously evaluate all relevant economic and operational factors potentially affecting the Bank or the fair value of its assets, including goodwill. Should future economic consequences require a significant and sustained change in the operations of the Bank, re-evaluations of the Bank s goodwill valuation will be conducted on a more frequent basis. 
 
 Recent Events 
 On July 19, 2024, the Bank completed the previously announced purchase and assumption of the East Syracuse, NY branch of Berkshire Bank, the banking subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. In connection with the purchase, the Bank assumed 186.0 million in deposit liabilities and acquired 29.9 million in loans. With respect to the purchased loans, the Bank paid an amount equal to the sum of 95 of the aggregate unpaid principal balances, measured as of the closing date, plus any accrued interest related to the loans through the closing date. The Bank also paid a 5.8 premium on the aggregate amount of non-time deposits associated with the branch, measured as of the closing date (the Core Deposits ), and assumed all non-Core Deposits associated with the branch, measured as of the closing date, at par value. The total deposit premium paid by the Bank therefore equated to approximately 3.8 when applied to the aggregated Core Deposits and non-Core Deposits. The average cost of deposits acquired in the East Syracuse branch acquisition was approximately 1.99 (excluding the effects of future Core Deposit Intangible amortization). The Company utilized the additional liquidity obtained with this acquisition and paid down approximately 150 million of borrowings that had an average cost of approximately 5.33 at June 30, 2024. Finally, the Bank assumed Berkshire Bank s existing commercial lease for the real property associated with the branch with an annual lease payment of approximately 946,000, excluding property taxes and certain other associated property related obligations that the Bank also assumed, and purchased the personal property and fixtures located within the branch facility for approximately 224,000.

On September 30, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.10 per share on the Company's voting common and non-voting common stock, and a cash dividend of 0.10 per notional share for the issued warrant relating to the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. The dividends were payable to all shareholders of record on October 18, 2024 and were paid on November 8, 2024. 
 On October 15, 2024, Pathfinder announced that it sold its interest in the FitzGibbons Agency, which contributed 28,000 to the Company s net income and 24 basis points to its consolidated efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 2024, to Marshall Sterling Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting an active insurance brokerage market and the FitzGibbons Agency s success since initiating its partnership with the Bank 13 years ago, Pathfinder will receive approximately 2.0 million from the sale, which closed on October 1, 2024, and the Company expects to recognize a portion of that amount as a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Summary of 2024 Third Quarter Results 
 Net income decreased 6.8 million to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 4.6 million or 0.75 per share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income available to common shareholders of 2.2 million or 0.35 per share for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 results included a 9.0 million provision for credit losses due to 8.7 million of net charge offs resulting from a comprehensive loan portfolio review and 1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the previously announced July 2024 closing of the East Syracuse branch acquisition. 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 11.7 million, an increase of 16.6 from the third quarter of 2023. An increase in interest and dividend income of 3.5 million was primarily attributed to increases in interest income from loans, taxable investment securities, and federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits of 2.0 million, 1.2 million, and 426,000, respectively. The increase in loan interest income included an 887,000 catch-up interest payment associated with purchased loan pool positions. Increased interest and dividend income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 1.9 million. This increase in interest expense was predominantly the result of higher average interest rates and average balances associated with deposits and borrowings, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net interest margin was 3.34 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.07 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 27 basis points was driven by improvements in interest-earning asset yields, including 25 basis points attributed to the catch-up interest payment received in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher funding costs. 
 The provision for credit losses was 9.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 0.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a comprehensive loan portfolio review that the Bank undertook in the third quarter of 2024. Net charge-offs during the recent quarter were 8.7 million, representing 1.29 of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to 3.8 million, or an annualized 0.61 of average loans, in the third quarter of 2023. See the Provision for Credit Losses and Loan and Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. 
 Noninterest income totaled 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 514,000 or 43.1 from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 included increases of 278,000 in interchange fees, 196,000 in earnings and gain on bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") including a net death benefit of 175,000 on BOLI, and 49,000 in service charges on deposit accounts. 
 Noninterest expense totaled 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing 2.6 million from the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to 1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the East Syracuse branch acquisition, in addition to third quarter 2024 operating costs of approximately 462,000 associated with operating Pathfinder Bank s newest location. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, annualized noninterest expense represented 2.75 of average assets, including 43 basis points from acquisition-related expenses. The efficiency ratio was 75.28 , 1,186 basis points attributed to acquisition-related expenses. The efficiency ratio, which is not a financial metric under GAAP, is a measure that the Company believes is helpful to understanding its level of non-interest expense as a percentage of total revenue. Annualized 
 - 55 - 

noninterest expense represented 2.20 of average assets and the efficiency ratio was 67.93 in the third quarter of 2023.

Results of Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the Company's primary source of operating income for payment of operating expenses and providing for credit losses. It is the amount by which interest earned on loans, interest-earning deposits, and investment securities, exceeds the interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in net interest income and net interest margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, related yields, and associated funding costs. 
 The following tables set forth information concerning average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average yields and rates thereon for the periods indicated. Interest income and resultant yield information in the tables have not been adjusted for tax equivalency. Averages are computed on the daily average balance for each month in the period divided by the number of days in the period. Nonaccrual loans have been included in interest-earning assets for purposes of these calculations.

Third quarter 2024 net interest income was 11.7 million, an increase of 16.6 from the third quarter of 2023. An increase in interest and dividend income of 3.5 million was primarily attributed to average yield increases of 74 basis points on loans including 39 basis points from an 887,000 catch-up interest payment associated with purchased loan pool positions, 67 basis points on taxable investment securities, 227 basis points on fed funds sold and interest-earning deposits, and 65 basis points on all earning assets. The corresponding increase in interest income from loans, taxable investment securities, and federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits was 2.0 million, 1.2 million, and 426,000, respectively. Increased interest and dividend income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 1.9 million. This increase in interest expense was predominantly the result of higher interest average interest rates and average balances associated with deposits and borrowings, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin was 3.34 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.07 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 27 basis points was driven by improvements in earning asset yields and lower average borrowings, partially offset by higher funding costs, as well as 25 basis points attributed to the catch-up interest payment received in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net interest income before the provision for credit losses increased 852,000, or 2.9 , to 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same nine month period in 2023. This increase was due to a 9.5 million increase in total interest and dividend income, primarily attributed to average yield increases of 65 basis points on loans, 88 basis points on taxable investment securities, 49 basis points on tax-exempt investment securities, 214 basis points on fed funds sold and interest-earning deposits, and 70 basis points on all interest-earning assets as a result of the higher interest rate environment. The corresponding increase in interest income from taxable investment securities, loans, federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits, and tax-exempt investment securities was 4.7 
 - 58 - 

million, 4.3 million, 485,000, and 34,000, respectively. Increased interest and dividend income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 8.6 million. This increase in interest expense was predominantly the result of higher average interest rates and average balances associated with deposits and borrowings, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin was 2.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 5 basis points was driven primarily by a greater increase in funding costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same nine month period in 2023. 
 
 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 Net interest income can also be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in the volume or amount of these assets and liabilities. The following table represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) total increase or decrease. Changes attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated ratably. Tax-exempt securities have not been adjusted for tax equivalency.

Deposits 
 The Company s deposit base is drawn from eleven full-service branches and one motor bank in its market area. The deposit base consists of demand deposits, money management and money market deposit accounts, savings, and time deposits. Total deposits increased by 76.1 million, or 6.8 from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to 186.0 million in deposits assumed with the East Syracuse branch acquisition, offset by a reduction of 106.0 million in brokered deposits utilizing lower-cost liquidity provided by the transaction, as well as seasonal fluctuations in municipal deposits. At September 30, 2024, 77.45 of the Company's deposit base of 1.20 billion consisted of core deposits. Core deposits, which exclude certificates of deposit of 250,000 or more, are considered to be more stable and generally provide the Company with a lower cost of funds than time deposits. The Company will continue to emphasize retail and business core deposits in the future by providing depositors with a full range of deposit product offerings and will maintain its recent focus on deposit gathering within the Syracuse market. 
 A summary of deposits by category at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:

Provision for Credit Losses 
 We establish a provision for credit losses, which is charged to operations, at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for credit losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change. The provision for credit losses 
 - 60 - 

represents management s estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an adequate level. 
 The Company recorded 9.0 million in provision for credit losses for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 833,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The provisioning in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 reflects management s determination of the appropriate level of additions to reserves, the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in quantifiable econometric data statistically correlated to historical charge-off rates, subjective qualitative assessments of changes in a broad array of factors including changes to underwriting criteria, loan staffing and local market conditions. This represents an 8.1 million increase in provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase can be primarily attributed to a comprehensive loan portfolio review that the Bank elected to undertake as part of its commitment to continuously improve its credit risk management approach. Following its conclusion, the Company recorded net charge offs of 8.7 million in the quarter and reduced nonperforming loans by 34.0 to 16.2 million at period end, or 1.8 of total loans. The allowance for credit losses on September 30, 2024 represented 1.87 and 106.8 of total and nonperforming loans, respectively. 
 
 The third quarter 2024 provision for credit losses included an increase in certain qualitative and other factors that resulted in a net increase in the provision for loans of 369,000, offset by a decrease in specific reserves of approximately 13,000. The Bank's credit sensitive portfolios continue to be carefully monitored, and the Bank will consistently apply its loan classification and reserve building methodologies to the analysis of these portfolios. Please refer to the asset quality section below for a further discussion of asset quality as it relates to the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 There was an increase in the provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 to 10.0 million, an increase of 7.3 million from 2.7 million for the same nine months in 2023. This increase can also be primarily attributed to the aforementioned net charge offs of 8.7 million during the third quarter that the Bank undertook after a comprehensive loan portfolio review. 
 
 The Company measures delinquency based on the amount of past due loans (defined as loans equal to or greater than 30 days past due) as a percentage of total loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans was 4.1 and 3.8 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Delinquent loans (numerator) increased 3.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Total loan balances (denominator) increased 25.5 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase of 1.3 million and 3.7 million in loans delinquent 30-59 days and 60-89 days, respectively, slightly offset by a decrease in loans delinquent 90 days and over of 1.1 million. 
 
 The Bank continues to diligently monitor credit portfolios, particularly those considered sensitive to prevailing economic stressors, and apply conservative loan classification and reserve building methodologies.

Noninterest income totaled 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 514,000 or 43.1 from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 included increases of 278,000 in interchange volume and rate improvement, 196,000 in earnings and gain on BOLI including a net death benefit of 175,000 on BOLI, and 49,000 in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest income growth from the year-ago quarter also reflected increases of 101,000 in net realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities and 49,000 in gains on sales of loans and foreclosed real estate, partially offset by a 175,000 increase in net realized losses on sales and redemptions of investment securities. 
 Noninterest income totaled 4.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 783,000 or 20.2 from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 included a non-recurring gain of 245,000 related to refunds received from cumulative lessor related pass-through operating expense charges for a single leased branch location. Noninterest income growth during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same prior year period also reflected a 239,000 gain on marketable equity securities, 219,000 in earnings and gain on BOLI, a 155,000 increase in interchange fees, a 118,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a 41,000 increase in loan servicing fees, and a 23,000 increase in insurance agency revenue, partially offset by a 380,000 increase in net realized losses on sales and redemptions of investment securities. Total noninterest income had an aggregate gain of 123,000 in all other categories. 
 
 Third quarter 2024 results reflect the Bank s strategy to proactively seek out and capitalize on new opportunities to diversify and enhance recurring noninterest income s contribution to total revenue. As the Bank moves forward with its growth strategy, noninterest income is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in maintaining a well-balanced and resilient financial profile.

Noninterest expense totaled 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing 2.6 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to 1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the East Syracuse branch acquisition, in addition to third quarter 2024 operating costs of approximately 462,000 associated with operating Pathfinder Bank s newest location. 
 Professional and other services expense was 1.8 million in the third quarter, increasing 1.3 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily attributed to branch acquisition-related expenses. 
 Salaries and benefits were 5.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing 805,000 from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to 141,000 transaction-related bonuses to employees, 115,000 reduced salary cost deferrals ASC 310-20 associated with reduced lending volumes, and 80,000 of ongoing personnel-related costs associated with operating the branch acquired early in the third quarter of 2024. The remaining increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits costs associated with merit increases and wage inflation. 
 Building and occupancy was 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, increasing 266,000 from the year-ago quarter. These increases were mostly due to ongoing facilities-related costs of approximately 322,000 associated with operating the branch acquired early in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Noninterest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.9 million, an increase of 3.5 million, or 15.8 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 1.6 million in transaction-related expenses for the East Syracuse branch acquisition, in addition to third quarter 2024 operating costs of approximately 462,000 associated with operating Pathfinder Bank s newest location. 
 Professional and other services expense was 3.1 million during the first nine months of 2024, increasing 1.5 million from the year-ago period. Salaries and benefits were 13.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increasing 1.4 million, or 11.8 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Building and occupancy was 2.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, increasing 165,000 from the year-ago period. These increases were all primarily attributed to the aforementioned branch acquisition-related expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 1.7 million to a 1.2 million benefit, with an effective tax rate of 20.3 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 573,000 in expense with an effective tax rate of 20.7 for the same three month period in 2023. The decrease in income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, was primarily driven by the current quarter net loss. The effective income tax rate decreased 0.4 to 20.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20.7 for the same three month period 
 - 63 - 

in 2023. The decrease in the tax rate in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same quarter in 2023, was primarily related to fluctuations in permanent tax differences. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 1.9 million to a 160,000 benefit, with an effective tax rate of 27.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.8 million in expense with an effective tax rate of 20.6 , for the same nine month period in 2023. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same nine month period in 2023, was primarily driven by the year-over-year decrease in income before taxes coupled with increases in permanent tax differences. The effective income tax rate increased 6.5 to 27.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20.6 for the same nine month period in 2023. The increase in the tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily related to fluctuations in permanent tax differences. 
 
 The Company s tax liability is a function of the 21 statutory federal tax rate, the level of pretax income, the varying effects of New York State income taxes, and is partially reduced by tax-exempt income from specific types of investment securities and loans, bank owned life insurance, and, to a much lesser degree, the utilization of historic and low income housing tax credits. In addition, the tax effects of certain incentive stock option activity may reduce the Company s effective tax rate on a sporadic basis. 
 
 Earnings per Share 
 Basic and diluted earnings per Voting and Series A Non-Voting share were (0.75) per share for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.35 for the same prior year period. The decrease in earnings per share between these two periods was due to the decrease in net income. 
 
 Basic and diluted earnings per Voting and Series A Non-Voting share were (0.09) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.10 for the same prior year period. The decrease in earnings per share between these two periods was due to the decrease in net income. Further information on earnings per share can be found in Note 3 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Financial Condition 
 Assets 
 Total assets increased 17.3 million, or 1.18 , to 1.48 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was due primarily to increases in total loans, finance lease right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, net. These increases were partially offset by decreases in total cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. 
 Loans totaled 921.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 24.5 million, or 2.73 , compared to 897.2 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by 29.9 million in loans acquired from Berkshire Bank and represented increases of 14.8 million in total consumer loans, 10.3 million in total commercial loans, and 353,000 in total residential mortgage loans. 
 Finance lease right-of-use assets totaled 16.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.8 million, which can be attributed to the acquisition of the East Syracuse branch on July 19, 2024. Intangible assets, net, totaled 6.2 million, an increase of 6.1 million, primarily due to the core deposit intangible created through our branch acquisition, also as a result of the purchase of the East Syracuse branch during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Total cash and cash equivalents totaled 35.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13.4 million, or 27.5 , compared to 48.7 million at December 31, 2023. This decline was due to a decrease of 20.0 million in interest-earning deposits, partially offset by an increase in cash and due from banks of 6.6 million. 
 Investment securities, including investment in FHLBNY stock, decreased by 7.3 million, or 1.63 , to 442.6 million at September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to decreases in HTM securities and FHLBNY stock of 17.9 million and 3.3 million, respectively. The total decrease in investment securities was partially offset by increases in AFS securities and marketable equity securities of 13.3 million and 666,000, respectively 
 - 64 - 

Liabilities 
 
 Total liabilities increased 16.5 million, or 1.23 , to 1.36 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.35 billion at December 31, 2023. The overall increase was due primarily to increases in total deposits and finance lease liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in total short and long-term borrowings. 
 
 Total deposits increased 76.1 million, or 6.80 , from 1.12 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.20 billion at September 30, 2024. This increase was due to a 39.9 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, as well as a 36.2 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. Finance lease liabilities totaled 16.8 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.5 million from December 31, 2023. Increases in total deposits of 186.0 million and finance lease liabilities of 13.0 million can both be attributed to the acquisition of the East Syracuse branch during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Short-term borrowed funds from FHLBNY decreased 65.4 million, or 52.0 , to 60.3 million at September 30, 2024, while long-term borrowed funds from FHLBNY decreased 10.2 million, or 20.3 , to 39.8 million at September 30, 2024. Both decreases in short-term and long-term borrowed funds are due to the Company utilizing a portion of the low-cost liquidity provided by the acquisition of the East Syracuse branch to pay down these borrowings during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Shareholders Equity 
 Shareholders' equity increased by 751,000, or 0.6 , from 119.5 million at December 31, 2023, to 120.2 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a 2.9 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, as well as increases of 135,000 and 117,000 in unearned ESOP shares and additional paid-in-capital, respectively, reduced by a decrease of 2.4 million in retained earnings. 
 
 Capital 
 Capital adequacy is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets, as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics. The Company s goal is to maintain a strong capital position, consistent with the risk profile of its banking operations. This strong capital position serves to support growth and expansion activities while at the same time exceeding regulatory standards. At September 30, 2024, the Bank met the regulatory definition of a well-capitalized institution, i.e. a leverage capital ratio exceeding 5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeding 8 , Tier 1 common equity exceeding 6.5 , and a total risk-based capital ratio exceeding 10 . 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is separate from the capital ratios required under the Prompt Corrective Actions PCA standards. In order to avoid these restrictions, the capital conservation buffer effectively increases the minimum levels of the following capital to risk-weighted assets ratios: (1) Core Capital, (2) Total Capital and (3) Common Equity. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios, including the capital buffer requirements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Regulation G, a rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), applies to certain SEC filings, including earnings releases, made by registered companies that contain non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP is generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Under Regulation G, companies making public disclosures containing non-GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure (if a comparable GAAP measure exists) and a statement of the Company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure as part of its financial disclosures. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. When these exempted measures are included in public disclosures, supplemental information is not required. Financial institutions like the Company and its subsidiary bank are subject to an array of bank regulatory capital measures that are financial in nature but are not based on GAAP. The Company follows industry practice in disclosing its financial condition under these various regulatory capital measures, including period-end regulatory capital ratios for its subsidiary bank, in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. The Company provides, below, an explanation of the calculations, as supplemental information, for non-GAAP measures included in the consolidated annual financial statements. In addition, the Company provides a reconciliation of its subsidiary bank s disclosed regulatory capital measures, below.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate FRE ). 
 
 As indicated in the table above, nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were 16.2 million, and were 1.2 million lower than the 17.4 million reported at December 31, 2023 and 192,000 lower than the 16.4 million reported at September 30, 2023. The decrease in the nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was driven by charge-offs for loans in two consumer loan pools with a balance of 2.2 million, as well as the downgrade of one commercial real estate loan with a balance of 1.4 million. 
 - 67 - 

Fair values for commercial FRE are initially recorded based on market value evaluations by third parties, less costs to sell initial cost basis ). On a prospective basis, residential FRE assets will be initially recorded at the lower of the net amount of loan receivable or the real estate s fair value less costs to sell. Any write-downs required when the related loan receivable is exchanged for the underlying real estate collateral at the time of transfer to FRE are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Values are derived from appraisals of underlying collateral or discounted cash flow analysis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically and assets are marked to current fair value, not to exceed the initial cost basis for the FRE property. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s estimate of the lifetime losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the statement of condition. The allowance for credit losses was 17.3 million and 16.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.87 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.78 at December 31, 2023 and 1.76 at September 30, 2023. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for credit losses based on quantitative and qualitative factors and has determined that the current level of the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb the losses in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 Loans purchased outside of the Bank s general market area are subject to substantial pre-purchase due diligence. Homogenous pools of purchased loans are subject to pre-purchase analyses led by a team of the Bank s senior executives and credit analysts. In each case, the Bank s analytical processes consider the types of loans being evaluated, the underwriting criteria employed by the originating entity, the historical performance of such loans, especially in the most recent deeply recessionary period, the offered collateral enhancements and other credit loss mitigation factors offered by the seller and the capabilities and financial stability of the servicing entities involved. From a credit risk perspective, these loan pools also benefit from broad diversification, including wide geographic dispersion, the readily-verifiable historical performance of similar loans issued by the originators, as well as the overall experience and skill of the underwriters and servicing entities involved as counterparties to the Bank in these transactions. The performance of all purchased loan pools are monitored regularly from detailed reports and remittance reconciliations provided at least monthly by the external servicing entities. 
 The projected credit losses related to purchased loan pools are evaluated prior to purchase and the performance of those loans against expectations are analyzed at least monthly. Over the life of the purchased loan pools, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted, through the provision for credit losses, for expected loss experience, over the projected life of the loans. The expected credit loss experience is determined at the time of purchase and is modified, to the extent necessary, during the life of the purchased loan pools. The Bank does not initially increase the allowance for credit losses on the purchase date of the loan pools. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 19.6 million and 22.6 million in loans, respectively, which were individually analyzed, having established specific reserves of 2.4 million and 3.7 million, respectively, on these loans. The 3.0 million decrease in specifically identified loans between these two dates was the result of a single relationship charge-off. 
 Appraisals are obtained at the time a real estate secured loan is originated. For commercial real estate held as collateral, the property is inspected every two years. 
 Management has identified certain loans with potential credit profiles that may result in the borrowers not being able to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in possible future identified loan reporting. Potential problem loans totaled 37.0 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.1 million, as compared to 43.1 million at December 31, 2023. These loans have been internally classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful, yet are not currently considered specifically-identified. 
 In the normal course of business, the Bank has, from time to time, sold residential mortgage loans and participation interests in commercial loans. As is typical in the industry, the Bank makes certain representations and warranties to the buyer. Pathfinder Bank maintains a quality control program for closed loans and considers the risks and uncertainties associated with potential repurchase requirements to be minimal. 
 - 68 - 

The future performance of the Company s loan portfolios with respect to credit losses will be highly dependent upon the course and duration, both nationally and within the Company s market area, of the concentrations in the Company s loan portfolio. Concentrations of loans within a portfolio that are made to a single borrower, to a related group of borrowers, or to a limited number of industries, are generally considered to be additional risk factors in estimating future credit losses. Therefore, the Company monitors all of its credit relationships to ensure that the total loan amounts extended to one borrower, or to a related group of borrowers, does not exceed the maximum permissible levels defined by applicable regulation or the Company s generally more restrictive internal policy limits. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity management involves the Company s ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, and otherwise operate the Company on an ongoing basis. The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowed funds, amortization and prepayment of loans and maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired deposit composition and balance. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. 
 The Company's liquidity has been enhanced by its ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY ), whose competitive advance programs and lines of credit provide the Company with a safe, reliable, and convenient source of funds. A significant decrease in deposits in the future could result in the Company having to seek other sources of funds for liquidity purposes. Such sources could include, but are not limited to, additional borrowings, brokered deposits, negotiated time deposits, the sale of "available-for-sale" investment securities, the sale of securitized loans, or the sale of whole loans. Such actions could result in higher interest expense and/or losses on the sale of securities or loans. 
 Through the first nine months of 2024, as indicated in the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company reported net cash flow from operating activities of 13.9 million and net cash outflows of 26.1 million related to investing activities. The net cash outflows from investing activities was generated principally by an increase of 33.3 million in net loan activity, a 6.3 million increase in gross core deposit intangibles, and a 1.6 million increase in premises and equipment, offset by a 12.0 million decrease in net investment activity, and an increase of 3.0 million in proceeds received from the sale of assets-held-for-sale. The Company reported net cash outflows from financing activities of 1.1 million, primarily due to a 76.1 million increase in net deposit balances from the acquisition of the East Syracuse branch, a 75.5 million decrease in borrowings, and an aggregate decrease of 1.7 million in net cash from all other financing sources, including dividends paid to common voting and non-voting shareholders and warrants of 1.8 million. 
 The Bank s management monitors liquidity on a continuous basis through a broad range of internal programs and considers effective liquidity management to be one of its primary objectives. At September 30, 2024 the Bank had deposits of 1.20 billion, of which a portion were nominally uninsured, as they were above the insurance limits established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC on that date. Of the nominally uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024, 76.1 million were insured through a long-standing reciprocal deposit program managed by a third-party entity. In addition, 110.5 million in municipal deposits are fully protected against principal loss by a collateral program whereby the Bank places high-quality securities with an independent custodian as collateral. The Bank had 146.9 million in deposits, representing 12.3 of all deposits, that were considered to be uninsured at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company has a number of existing credit facilities available to it. At September 30, 2024, total credit available under the existing lines of credit was approximately 232.7 million at FHLBNY, the Federal Reserve Bank, and two other correspondent banks. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 100.1 million of the available lines of credit utilized on its existing lines of credit with the remainder of 132.6 million available. 
 - 69 - 

The Asset Liability Management Committee of the Company is responsible for implementing the policies and guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, management reported to the Board of Directors that the Company is in compliance with its liquidity policy guidelines. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company is also a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 222.3 million in outstanding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. 
 
 The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance related to off-balance sheet arrangements is proportional to the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. The Company records an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, unless such commitments are unconditionally cancelable, through the provision for credit losses expense. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures as of September 30, 2024 was 556,000 and is included in other liabilities on the Company's consolidated Statements of Condition. 
 
 Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk

 Item 4 Control s and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO (the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer), management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
 We did not make any changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
