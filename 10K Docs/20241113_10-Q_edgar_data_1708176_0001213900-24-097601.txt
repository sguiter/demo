million as of such date. Since inception, the Company s operations have been
funded principally through the issuance of debt and equity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million of unrestricted
cash and million of restricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used cash for operating activities
of million. The Company has approximately million of debt coming due through November 13, 2025, including approximately 
million of debt due December 4, 2024. 

On September 27, 2024, the Company received a nonbinding proposal from
IRG (as defined below) related to a proposed acquisition of HOFV by IRG. In response to the proposal, the Company s Board of Directors
formed a special committee made up of independent, disinterested directors (the Special Committee to evaluate the proposal.
The Special Committee and IRG are currently in discussions on this proposed acquisition. 

On October 26, 2024, the Company received a
notice of termination due to event of default on its waterpark ground lease. Under the waterpark ground lease, the notice of
termination required that the Company immediately surrender the waterpark premises and related improvements to the landlord. The event of default under the Waterpark Ground Lease results in an event of default under certain of the Company s loan agreements.
Given the Company s financial position, the Company is in default or risks becoming in default under certain other loan agreements.
The loan agreements under which the Company is in default total approximately million gross principal outstanding as of September
30, 2024. See Note 14 Subsequent Events for more discussion of this termination. 

The Company will need to raise additional financing to accomplish its
development plan and fund its working capital. The Company is seeking to obtain additional funding through debt, construction lending,
and equity financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company or at
all. Cash flows generated from the Company s operations are insufficient to meet its current operating costs. If the Company is
unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development, which could
harm its financial condition and operating results, or it may not be able to continue to fund or must significantly curtail its ongoing
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern to meet its obligations
as they come due for at least one year from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

-year term. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company s initial base rent is approximately
 per quarter, with annual increases of approximately each year of the term. The Company has a right to re-purchase the land
from Twain at any time on or after September 27, 2025 at a fixed price according to the lease. 

On November 7, 2022, HOFV Waterpark sold the land
under the Company s future waterpark to Oak Street Real Estate Capital, LLC Oak Street ). Simultaneously, the Company
entered into a lease agreement with Oak Street. The Sale-Leaseback for the waterpark is repayable over a -year term. Under the terms
of the leaseback agreement, the Company s initial base rent is per annum, payable monthly, with customary escalations
over the lease term. On November 7, 2022, Oak Street and HOFV Waterpark also entered into a Purchase Option Agreement (the Purchase
Option Agreement ), pursuant to which HOFV Waterpark is granted an option to purchase the waterpark property back from Oak Street
that can be exercised during the period beginning on December 1, 2027 and ending on November 30, 2034 (the Option Period ). 

The Company accounted for the Sale-Leaseback transactions
with Twain and Oak Street as financing transactions with the purchaser of the property. The Company concluded the lease agreements both
met the qualifications to be classified as finance leases due to the significance of the present value of the lease payments, using a
discount rate of to reflect the Company s incremental borrowing rate, compared to the fair value of the leased property as
of the lease commencement date. 

The presence of a finance-type lease in the sale-leaseback
transactions indicates that control of the land under the Fan Engagement Zone and HOFV Waterpark has not transferred to the buyer/lessor
and, as such, the transactions were both deemed a failed sale-leaseback and must be accounted for as a financing arrangement. As a result
of this determination, the Company is viewed as having received the sales proceeds from the buyer/lessor in the form of a hypothetical
loan collateralized by its leased land. The hypothetical loan is payable as principal and interest in the form of lease payments 
to the buyer/lessor. As such, the Company will not derecognize the property from its books for accounting purposes until the lease ends. 

On February 23, 2024, HOFV Waterpark entered into
a first amendment to lease agreement First Amendment to Lease with Oak Street to amend the existing water park ground
lease to reflect: (a) Oak Street s funding for the benefit of the Tenant in the amount of , (b) an increase in the base
rent; (c) the pledge of the Company s beneficial membership interest in Sandlot; and (d) the Company s issuance of a Series
H Common Stock Purchase Warrant to Oak Street to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, which is exercisable (a)
prior to Landlord s return of of such warrants pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to Lease, when and if there is an
event of default under the water park lease, or the guaranty related to the underlying ground lease, or (b) after Landlord s return
of of such warrants pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to Lease, at any time.

the waterpark ground lease. The Company was in negotiations with Oak Street to negotiate an amendment that provides for extending the
base rent forbearance payment date under the waterpark ground lease or a similar outcome. However, on October 26, 2024, Oak Street sent the Company a notice of default and termination. See Note 14 Subsequent Events.

Business Overview 

We are a resort and entertainment company
leveraging the power and popularity of professional football and its legendary players in partnership with the National Football
Museum, Inc., doing business as the Pro Football Hall of Fame PFHOF ). Headquartered in Canton, Ohio, we own the Hall
of Fame Village, which is a multi-use sports and entertainment destination centered around the PFHOF s campus and the
DoubleTree by Hilton located in downtown Canton. We have created a diversified set of revenue streams through the development of
themed attractions, premier entertainment programming and sponsorships. We continue to pursue a diversified strategy across three
business verticals, including destination-based assets (Hall of Fame Village), Hall of Fame Village Media and Gold Summit Gaming. 

The strategic plan for Hall of Fame Village involves
three phases: Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III. Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village is operational, consisting of the Tom Benson Hall
of Fame Stadium, the ForeverLawn Sports Complex (ownership reduced to 20 as of January 11, 2024), and Hall of Fame Village Media. The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosts multiple sports and entertainment events, including the National Football
League NFL Hall of Fame Game, Enshrinement and Concert for Legends during the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement
Week. The ForeverLawn Sports Complex hosts camps and tournaments for football players, as well as athletes from across the country in
other sports such as lacrosse, rugby and soccer. Hall of Fame Village Media leverages the sport of professional football to produce exclusive
programming. Hall of Fame Village Media has created short-form and long-form media entertainment through multiple distribution channels.
This includes The Perfect Ten , Inspired , The GOAT Code , Next Man Up: NFL Alumni Academy and Hometown Heroes . 

We have procured licenses through the State of
Ohio for both a physical sports betting operation and online sports betting platform. We have entered into an agreement with BETR as our
mobile management services provider. In addition, the gaming vertical hosts multiple eSports tournaments within the destination along
with other types of gaming tournaments and interactive events. 

We have developed new hospitality, attractions,
and corporate assets as part of our Phase II development plan. Phase II components of the Hall of Fame Village include the Constellation
Center for Excellence (an office building including retail and meeting space, that opened in November 2021), the Center for Performance
(a convention center/field house, that opened in August of 2022), the Play Action Plaza (completed in August of 2022), and the Fan Engagement
Zone (Retail Promenade), core and shell for Retail I was completed in August of 2022 and the core and shell of Retail II was completed
in November of 2022, two hotels (one on campus, to be constructed, and one in downtown Canton that opened in November 2020), and the Gameday
Bay Waterpark (currently under construction; ground lease terminated October 26, 2024, and premises and improvements
surrendered to landlord). Phase III expansion plans may include a potential mix of residential space, additional attractions,
entertainment, dining, merchandise and more.

Key Components of the Company s Results
of Operations 

Revenue 

We generate revenue from various streams such
as sponsorship agreements, rents, events, exclusive programming, attractions and hotel and restaurant operations. The sponsorship arrangements,
in which the customer sponsors an asset or event and receives specified brand recognition and other benefits over a set period of time,
recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the time period specified in the contract. Revenue for rents, cost recoveries, and events
are recognized at the time the respective event or service has been performed. Rental revenue for long term leases is recorded on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease beginning on the commencement date. 

Our owned hotel revenues primarily consist of
hotel room sales, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package reservations), food and beverage
sales, and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking) related to owned hotel property and events. Revenue is recognized when rooms
are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the goods and
services are provided. 

Restaurant revenue at Company-operated restaurants
and concessions is recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale, net of sales tax, discounts and other sales related taxes. 

Our media content and distribution revenue is
recognized as content is released. Our gaming license revenue is recognized over the term of the license agreement. 

We expect our revenues to continue to increase
as we add in additional events, tenants, experiences and open additional assets. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses include event/media production
expenses, personnel expenses, campus maintenance expenses, food and beverage cost of sales, hotel operating expenses, and depreciation
expense. These expenses have increased with completion of Phase II assets and we would expect these will continue to increase after completion
of additional events, programming, and assets, and Phase III development. 

Our depreciation expense includes the related
costs of owning and operating significant property and entertainment assets. These expenses have grown through completion of the Phase
I and Phase II development.

default under the Sale-Leaseback. Oak Street had agreed to forbear exercising remedies for the payment default until October 25, 2024.
As of November 13, 2024, the Company had not remedied the payment default. The outstanding principal balance of unpaid base rent under
the Sale-Leaseback (inclusive of default interest and late fees accrued up to the date of termination) is approximately 2,600,000.

been the remaining term of the Waterpark Ground Lease exceeds the then fair market rental value of the waterpark premises, both discounted
to present value, plus (ii) any damages, including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, which Landlord
sustains as a result of the breach of the covenants of the Waterpark Ground Lease other than for the payment of rent, in each case plus
interest.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have sustained recurring losses through September
30, 2024, and our accumulated deficit was 252.0 million as of such date. Since inception, the Company s operations have been funded principally
through the issuance of debt and equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.6 million of unrestricted cash and 4.9 million
of restricted cash. Through November 13, 2025, we have 97.1 million in debt principal payments coming due, including approximately 11.2 million of debt due December 4, 2024. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company used cash for operating activities of 7.1 million. 

On June 28, 2024, we were awarded a 9.8 Million
grant from the State of Ohio s One Time Strategic Community Investments in support of the Hall of Fame Village. We received this
funding on August 9, 2024. 

On September 27, 2024, the Company received a

On October 26, 2024, the Company received a notice of termination due
to event of default on its waterpark ground lease. Under the waterpark ground lease, the notice of termination required that the Company
immediately surrender the waterpark premises and related improvements to the landlord. The event of default under the Waterpark Ground Lease results in an event of default under certain of the Company s loan agreements.
Given the Company s financial position, the Company is in default or risks becoming in default under certain other loan agreements.
The loan agreements under which the Company is in default total approximately 81 million gross principal outstanding as of September
30, 2024. 

We will need to raise additional financing to accomplish our development
plan and fund our working capital. We are seeking to obtain additional funding through debt, construction lending, and equity financing.
There are no assurances that we will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. Cash flows generated from
our operations are insufficient to meet our current operating costs. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital,
we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned development, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, or
we may not be able to continue to fund or must significantly curtail our ongoing operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern to sustain operations for at least one year from the issuance of these condensed consolidated
financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of these uncertainties.

Net cash used in operating activities was 7.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 12.4 million from the same period in the prior year. The decrease in cash used in operating
activities was primarily attributable to a 14.3 million decrease in net loss between the two periods, along with a 2.1 million increase
in the add-back for depreciation expense, a 4.7 million increase in paid-in-kind interest, offset by a 7.5 million increase in the change
in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a 3.2 million increase in the change in prepaid expenses and other assets. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 8.7
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11.4 million from the same period last year. The decrease was
attributable to a decrease of 20.5 million in capital spending on project development, 17.5 million invested in treasury bills during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, offset by an increase 8.4 million received from the sale of assets. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 11.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.4 million from the same period last year. The decrease
was primarily attributable to an increase of 11.7 million in repayments of notes payable, a decrease of 2.0 million in notes payable
proceeds, offset by 3.5 million in proceeds from our financing liability. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
as of September 30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

For information on our significant accounting
policies please refer to Note 2 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

We have established disclosure
controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and made known to the officers who certify our financial reports
and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we are required to apply
our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

In
connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we concluded there was
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the precise and timely review and analysis of information
used to prepare our financial statements and disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have taken steps to remediate this material
weakness in internal control over financial reporting; however, we are not yet able to determine whether the steps we are taking will
fully remediate the material weakness. 

Because of the material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting as previously disclosed, our principal executive officer and interim principal accounting officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. Our management,
including our principal executive officer and interim principal accounting officer, have concluded that, notwithstanding the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the
Company continues to implement its plan of remediation for the material weakness discussed above. There have been no other changes to
the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal proceedings 

During the normal course of its business, the
Company is subject to occasional legal proceedings and claims. The Company does not have any pending litigation that, separately or in
the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition,
or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk factors 

Our operations and financial results are subject
to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended
March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, other than: 

We have identified a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of this material weakness is not effective, or if we experience additional
material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value
of our common stock. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management
is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and to disclose
any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation of those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

In connection with the audit of our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were
not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to the existence of a material weaknesses as follows: We identified, a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting related to the precise and timely review and analysis of information used to prepare our financial
statements and disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This material weakness could impact our financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. We have taken steps to remediate this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting; however, we are
not yet able to determine whether the steps we are taking will fully remediate the material weakness. 

Because of the material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting as previously disclosed, our principal executive officer and interim principal accounting officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. Our management,
including our principal executive officer and interim principal accounting officer, have concluded that, notwithstanding the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

The existence of material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our reputation or investor
perceptions of us, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, we have and will continue to incur
additional costs to remediate our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.

Our recurring losses from operations have
raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and our business plan requires additional liquidity and
capital resources that might not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 

We have sustained recurring
losses through September 30, 2024, and our accumulated deficit was 252.0 million as of such date. Since inception, our operations have
been funded principally through the issuance of debt and equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.6 million of unrestricted
cash and 4.9 million of restricted cash. Through November 13, 2025, we have 97.1 million in debt principal payments coming due, including approximately 11.2 million of debt due December 4, 2024. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used cash for operating activities of 7.1 million. 

While our strategy assumes that we will receive
sufficient capital to have sufficient working capital, we currently do not have available cash and cash flows from operations to provide
us with adequate liquidity for the near-term or foreseeable future. Our current projected liabilities exceed our current cash projections
and we have very limited cash flow from current operations. We therefore will require additional capital and/or cash flow from future
operations to fund the Company, our debt service obligations and our ongoing business. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient additional capital or generate sufficient future cash flow from our future operations to fund the Hall of Fame Village, our
debt service obligations or our ongoing business. If the amount of capital we are able to raise, together with any income from future
operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital needs, including funding our current debt obligations, we may be required
to abandon or alter our plans for the Company. The Company may have to raise additional capital through the equity market, which could
result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If management is unable to execute its planned debt and equity financing initiatives,
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to sustain operations for at least one year from the issuance of
our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties. 

Our ability to obtain necessary financing
may be impaired by factors such as the health of and access to capital markets, our limited track record and the limited historical financial
information available, or the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Any additional capital raised through
the sale of additional shares of our capital stock, convertible debt or other equity may dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders.
The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about
our ability to meet our contractual obligations. 

There is no assurance that the non-binding
proposal from IRG Canton Village Member, LLC IRG ), an affiliate of the Company s director Stuart Lichter, will result
in a definitive transaction, and the absence of us entering into a definitive transaction agreement, changes to the proposal, or the commencement
of related litigation may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

We received a non-binding proposal on September
27, 2024, from IRG, an affiliate of the Company s director Stuart Lichter, outlining IRG s preliminary non-binding proposal Proposal to acquire, through a to-be-formed affiliated entity Buyer ), all of the outstanding shares of
common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ), of the Company that are not held by Buyer, its affiliated
entities and any potential co-investors in Buyer or its affiliates (the Proposed Transaction at a purchase price of 1.98
per share of Common Stock, to be paid in cash, which assumes an aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding as of the consummation of
the Proposed Transaction that does not exceed the aggregate amount of indebtedness that is outstanding as of the date of the Proposal. 

In response to the proposal, the Company s
Board of Directors formed a special committee made up of independent, disinterested directors (the Special Committee to
evaluate the proposal. The Special Committee has retained a financial advisor and legal counsel to assist in its ongoing review and evaluation
of the proposal. There is no guarantee that any proposal made by IRG regarding a proposed transaction will be accepted by the Special
Committee, that definitive documentation relating to any such transaction will be executed, or that a transaction will be consummated
in accordance with that documentation, if at all. The absence of a definite offer to acquire the shares of Common stock owned by persons
other than Buyer, its affiliated entities and any potential co-investors in Buyer or its affiliates, or changes to the terms of the Proposed
Transaction, as well as the commencement of litigation regarding any proposed transaction, would likely have an adverse effect on the
market price of shares of our common stock.

The termination of the waterpark ground
lease and surrender of the waterpark premises and improvements to the landlord, which occurred October 26, 2024, and the exercise of certain
remedies by waterpark landlord would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition, and results
of operations of the Company. 

On October 26, 2024, HOF Village Waterpark, LLC Tenant ),
a subsidiary of Hall of Fame Resort Entertainment Company (the Company ), received from HFAKOH001 LLC Landlord a notice of termination due to event of default (the Notice under the waterpark ground lease agreement, dated as of November
7, 2022, between Tenant and Landlord, as amended on February 23, 2024, February 29, 2024 and May 10, 2024 (as so amended, the Waterpark
Ground Lease ). Under the Waterpark Ground Lease, the Landlord s termination requires that Tenant immediately surrender the
waterpark premises under such lease to the Landlord and any improvements thereto (including the construction of new buildings thereon)
with all fixtures appurtenant thereto. 

The default identified in the Notice is a payment default under the
Waterpark Ground Lease. The Landlord had agreed to forbear exercising remedies for the payment default until October 25, 2024. As of November 13, 2024, Tenant had not remedied the payment default. The outstanding principal balance of unpaid base rent under the Waterpark Ground
Lease (inclusive of default interest and late fees accrued up to the date of termination) is approximately 2,600,000. 

In addition to unpaid rent, the Waterpark Ground Lease provides
that Landlord is entitled to recover the following as damages: (i) the amount by which the unpaid rent for what would have been the remaining
term of the Waterpark Ground Lease exceeds the then fair market rental value of the waterpark premises, both discounted to present value,
plus (ii) any damages, including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, which Landlord sustains as a result
of the breach of the covenants of the Waterpark Ground Lease other than for the payment of rent, in each case plus interest. 

The Notice states that Landlord retains
the absolute and unconditional right to pursue any and all remedies available under the Waterpark Ground Lease and related security agreements
and applicable law, concurrently or consecutively, at Landlord s sole discretion. The Company s subsidiary HOF Village Newco,
LLC Guarantor guaranteed Tenant s obligations under the Waterpark Ground Lease pursuant to a limited recourse guaranty
dated as of November 7, 2022. The security agreements and collateral that support Tenant and Guarantor s obligations under the
Waterpark Ground Lease consist of the following: 

Tom
Benson Hall of Fame Stadium . Guarantor pledged and granted in favor of Landlord 100 of its membership interests in HOF Village Stadium,
LLC HOFV Stadium and certain related security interests under a Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of November 7,
2022. HOFV Stadium granted Landlord a security interest in HOFV Stadium s leasehold interest in the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium
and certain related security interests, pursuant to an Open-End Leasehold Mortgage, Assignment of Lease and Rents, Security Agreement
and Fixture Filing dated as of December 27, 2022. 

20 
Interest in ForeverLawn Sports Complex . Guarantor pledged and granted in favor of landlord its 20 interest in the ForeverLawn Sports
complex that is held in a joint venture with Sandlot Facilities, LLC, and certain related security interests, pursuant to a Pledge and
Security Agreement dated as of February 23, 2024. 

Real
Estate Adjacent to Hall of Fame Village . Guarantor granted Landlord a security interest in ten undeveloped residential real estate
parcels and four commercial real estate parcels owned by Guarantor located adjacent to Hall of Fame Village and certain related security
interests, pursuant to an Open-End Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing dated as of February
29, 2024. 

The exercise of certain remedies by Landlord would be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company. 

The event of default under the Waterpark Ground Lease results in an event of default under certain of the Company s loan agreements.
Given the Company s financial position, the Company is in default or risks becoming in default under certain other loan agreements.
The loan agreements under which the Company is in default total approximately 81 million gross principal outstanding as of September
30, 2024. 

We may be required to take write-downs
or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and our stock price, which could cause our stockholders to lose some or all of their investment. 

We may be forced to write-down
or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even
though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this
nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to
violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject. Accordingly, a stockholder could suffer a reduction in the value of their
shares of Common Stock. 

53 

If we fail to comply with the continued
listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would be expected to have a negative effect on the liquidity
and market price of our common stock, reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, limit or reduce the
amount of analyst coverage we receive, and impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. 

The continued listing standards of the Nasdaq
Stock Market, or Nasdaq, require, among other things, that (i) the minimum bid price of a listed company s stock be at or above
 1.00, and (ii) a listed company hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later than one year after the end of its fiscal year. If the
closing minimum bid price is below 1.00 for a period of more than 30 consecutive trading days or the Company does not hold an annual
meeting of shareholders by December 31, 2024, the Company will fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules and, if it does
not regain compliance within the grace period, will be subject to delisting. 

If the common stock
ceases to be listed for trading on Nasdaq, the Company would expect the common stock would be traded on one of the three tiered marketplaces
of the OTC Market Groups. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability
of market quotations for our securities; (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities; (iii) a determination that our Common Stock are penny
stock, which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced
level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; (iv) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; (v)
a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and (vi) being subject to regulation
in each state in which we offer our securities.
