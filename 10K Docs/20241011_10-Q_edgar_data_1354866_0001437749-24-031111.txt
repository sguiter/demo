million worth of shares of Common Stock (the Stock Buyback Program ). The Company's Stock Buyback Plan is intended to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. The Stock Buyback Program will expire on the sooner of the two -year anniversary of its initiation or until we reach the aggregate limit of million for the repurchases under the program. The repurchased shares are recorded as part of treasury stock and are accounted for under the cost method. In the three months ended August 31, 2024, we repurchased million shares of common stock for million. 
 
 The following table summarizes the treasury stock activity during the three months ended August 31, 2024:

shares. The 2020 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee determines the persons to whom options to purchase shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights SARs ), restricted stock units RSUs ), and restricted or unrestricted shares of Common Stock may be granted. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2020 Plan are employees, officers, directors, consultants, advisors and other individual service providers of the Company. Awards are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
 
 The Company accounts for all stock-based payment awards granted to employees and non-employees as stock-based compensation expense at their grant date fair value. The Company s stock-based payments include stock options, RSUs, and incentive warrants. The measurement date for employee awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period, on a straight-line basis. The measurement date for non-employee awards is generally the date the services were completed, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during either the expected term or the contractual term. Stock-based compensation costs for non-employees are recognized as expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 
 
 The fair value of each grant is estimated on the date of grant by using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial Lattice, or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case the Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model. Due to the Company s limited history, the expected term of the Company s stock options granted to employees has been determined utilizing the method as prescribed by the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin, Topic 14. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on Common Stock and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 Stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period, on a straight-line basis. Total stock-based compensation expense was million and million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense was million and million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense was recorded in Operating expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2024 the Company granted of the RSU's with a double trigger for vesting based on stock price and time, as follows: 1 one - third of the RSUs will be triggered when the Company s stock trades above on a 20 -day VWAP, the second one - third of the RSUs will be triggered when the Company s stock trades above on a 20 -day VWAP, and the final one - third of the RSUs will be triggered when the stock trades above on a 20 -day VWAP and 2 the employee must remain employed by the Company for three years from the effective date for the RSUs to vest. During the nine months ended August 31, 2023 , the Company did not grant "double trigger" RSUs. In addition, the Company also granted and time-based RSU's during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 

The assumptions that the Company used in a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the grant-date fair value of RSU's granted with a double trigger for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 were as follows: 

Expected dividends 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected life (in years) 
 Market price of the Company s Common Stock on date of grant 

As of August 31, 2024 , there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of years. 
 
 The following table summarizes the RSU activity during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 : 

Granted 
 Settled 
 Forfeited 
 Unvested and outstanding at August 31, 2024 

Of the restricted units issued, units were returned to the Company in exchange for the Company paying for the payroll withholding taxes, and units were repurchased by the Company for million for shares withheld to pay the payroll tax liability of the vesting RSUs and treated as treasury stock. For the nine months ended August 31, 2024 , RSUs of , net, were issued. 
 
 Stock Options 
 The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for options granted to its employees and directors of million and million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. As of August 31, 2024 , there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 Stock Option Valuation 
 The fair value of stock options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options granted for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 were as follows: 

Expected dividends 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected life (in years) 
 Market price of the Company s Common Stock on date of grant 

The following table summarizes option activity under the 2020 Plan during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 :

 Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, the Company may be subject to certain other legal actions and claims, including product liability, consumer, commercial, tax and governmental matters, which may arise from time to time. The Company does not believe it is currently a party to any pending legal proceedings. Notwithstanding, legal proceedings are subject-to inherent uncertainties, and an unfavorable outcome could include monetary damages, and excessive verdicts can result from litigation, and as such, could result in a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, although the Company has specific insurance for certain potential risks, the Company may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims which may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.

million and loss of million related to the South African rand during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The Company s South African subsidiary revenues, cost of goods sold, operating costs and capital expenditures are denominated in South African rand. Consequently, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the South African rand increases the volatility of sales, cost of goods sold and operating costs and overall net earnings when translated into U.S. dollars. The Company is not using any forward or option contracts to fix the foreign exchange rates. Using a fluctuation in the U.S. exchange rate, the impact on the loss and stockholders equity is not material. 
 
 ii) Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and the loan receivable from Byrna LATAM. The Company maintains cash with high credit quality financial institutions located in the U.S. and South Africa. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions in the U.S. in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit losses on accounts receivable balances. The Company uses a simplified approach to calculate a general provision for credit losses. An allowance is calculated for each aging bucket, based on the risk profile of that bucket. The Company revisits the reserve periodically, but no less than quarterly, with the same analytical approach in order to determine if the allowance needs to be increased or decreased, based calculation of each aging bucket. 
 
 The Company loaned million to Byrna LATAM in January 2023. The Company determines if an estimate for a credit loss on this loan is needed by considering the financial position of Byrna LATAM, the current economic environment, collections on our accounts receivable balances with Byrna LATAM, as well reasonable and supportable forecasts to support the payment of this loan. The Company reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included in Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Byrna Technologies is a designer, manufacturer, retailer and distributor of innovative technological solutions for security situations that do not require the use of lethal force. Our mantra is Live Safe , and our core mission is to empower individuals to safely and fully engage in life and adventure. Our design team s directive is to build easy-to-use self-defense tools to enhance the safety of our customers and their loved ones at home and outdoors. We are also focused on developing tools that can be used instead of firearms by professional law enforcement and private security customers to reduce shootings and facilitate trust between police and the communities they seek to serve. Our strategy is to establish Byrna as a consumer lifestyle brand associated with the confidence people can achieve by knowing they can protect themselves, their loved ones and those around them. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage the Byrna brand to expand our product line, broaden our user base and generate increasing sales from new and existing customers. 

19

Our business strategy is twofold: (1) to fulfill the growing demand for less-lethal products in the law enforcement, correctional services, and private security markets and (2) to provide civilians including those whose work or daily activities may put them at risk of being a victim with easy access to an effective, non-lethal way to protect themselves and their loved ones from threats to their person or property. 
 
 We believe that the United States, along with many other parts of the world, is experiencing a significant spike in the demand for less-lethal products and that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster growing segments of the security market over the next decade. We plan to respond to this demand for less-lethal products through the serial production and distribution of the Byrna SD and expansion of the Byrna product line. 
 
 On January 10, 2023, we created a new joint venture ("Byrna LATAM") with Fusady S.A. ("Fusady") located in Uruguay, to expand our operations and presence in South American markets. We held 51 of the stock in Byrna LATAM, and the remaining 49 of stock in Byrna LATAM was held by Fusady. Under the terms of the joint venture, we did not control the Byrna LATAM. On August 19, 2024 we sold our 51 ownership interest to Fusady S.A. for 1 and entered into an exclusive distribution, manufacturing and licensing agreement with Byrna LATAM. The LATAM Licensing Agreement allows Byrna LATAM to exclusively manufacture the Byrna SD launcher and ammunition in certain South American countries and requires Byrna LATAM to pay us a royalty on Byrna products manufactured. The LATAM Share Purchase Agreement also includes put and call rights based on defined triggers that expire August 19, 2029. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back up to 10 million worth of shares of our common stock (the Stock Buyback Program ). The Stock Buyback Program is intended to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. The Stock Buyback Program will expire on the sooner of the two-year anniversary of its initiation or until we reach the aggregate limit of 10 million for the repurchases under the program. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Three months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to three months ended August 31, 2023: 
 
 Net Revenue 
 Revenues were 20.9 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 which represents an increase of 13.8 million, or 194 , as compared to the prior year period revenues of 7.1 million. Most of the increase in revenue can be attributed to a new marketing strategy, implemented in September of 2023, shifting advertising efforts away from social media platforms and towards celebrity endorsers. Direct to customer sales, via Amazon and our website, increased by 11.0 million, or 216 , from 5.1 million in the fiscal quarter of 2023 to 16.1 million in the fiscal quarter of 2024. Sales to domestic dealers and retailers also improved, increasing by 107 to 3.4 million from 1.7 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023. Sales to Canadian customers increased by 0.2 million or 100 to 0.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to 0.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023. Sales to all other international markets increased from 0.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 0.9 million in the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 7.8 million in the fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to 3.9 million in the prior year period. This increase of 3.9 million, or 100 , is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of products, such as labor and overhead, inbound freight costs, manufacturing depreciation, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs. Gross profit was 13.0 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2024, or 62.4 of net revenue, as compared to gross profit of approximately 3.2 million, or 44.6 of net revenue, in the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the increase in the proportion of high margin direct to customer sales, from 67 of total sales in the prior year period to 77 of sales in the third fiscal quarter of 2024. The improvement was also due to higher absorption of fixed costs by increased production volume and due to reduced reliance on price discounts for sales promotions. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were 12.2 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.9 million, as compared to the prior year period expenses of 7.3 million. The increase is due to an increase of 2.6 million in marketing expenses, an increase of 1.2 million in variable expenses, which increase in proportion to sales volume, an increase of 1.2 million in accrued employee compensation costs. These cost increases were offset by a decrease of 0.9 million in stock compensation expense. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 We recorded 0.1 million of foreign currency translation loss during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.05 million of foreign currency translation loss during the three months ended August 31, 2023. We recorded 0.3 million of interest income during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023. We recorded a loss of 0.06 million from our South American joint venture investment as compared to a loss of 0.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023. 

20

Income Tax Provision 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , we recorded a nominal amount and 0.1 million of income tax benefit, respectively. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate was 0.1 and 2.8 , respectively. Our tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0 due to the effects of state taxes net of federal benefit, the foreign tax rate differential as a result of Byrna South Africa, effects of permanent non-deductible expenses, the recording of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated in the current period, and other effects. 
 
 Net Income/(Loss) 
 Net income was 1.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, an improvement of 5.1 million compared to the net loss of 4.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP) with presenting non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure helps us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measure. 
 
 Accordingly, we believe that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. 
 
 This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures, because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other non-GAAP measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measure as a tool for comparison. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income excluding the impact of (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income tax provision (benefit); (iii) interest income (expense); (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) impairment loss and (vi) one-time, non-recurring other expenses or income. Our Adjusted EBITDA measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting finance costs), tax positions, the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We also exclude certain one-time and non-cash costs. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands):

Nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to nine months ended August 31, 2023: 
 
 Net Revenue 
 Revenues were 57.8 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, an increase of 30.8 million or 114 as compared to the prior year period revenues of 27.0 million. Most of the increase in revenue can be attributed to a new marketing strategy, implemented in September of 2023, shifting advertising efforts away from social media platforms and to celebrity endorsers. Direct to customer sales, via Amazon and our website, increased by 25.9 million, or 140 , from 18.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023, to 44.4 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. Sales to domestic dealers and retailers increased by 58 to 9.8 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, from 6.2 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. Sales to Canadian customers increased by 0.4 million or 60 to 1.1 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to 0.7 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. Sales to all other international markets increased from 1.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023, to 2.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 22.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 12.4 million in the prior year period. The increase of 10.2 million, or 82 , is primarily due to the increase in sales volume. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of products, such as labor and overhead, inbound freight costs, manufacturing depreciation, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs. Gross profit was 35.2 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, or 60.9 of net revenue, as compared to gross profit of approximately 14.6 million, or 54.1 of net revenue, in the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the increase in the proportion of high margin direct to customer sales, from 66 of total sales in the prior year period to 77 of sales in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The improvement was also due to higher absorption of fixed costs by increased production volume and due to reduced reliance on price discounts for sales promotions. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were 32.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, an increase of 11.1 million, or 52 , as compared to the prior year period expenses of 21.5 million. The increase is due to an increase of 6.4 million in marketing expenses, an increase of 2.8 million in variable expenses, which increase in proportion to sales volume, an increase of 2.7 million in employee compensation costs. These cost increases were offset by a decrease of 2.1 million in stock compensation expense. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 We recorded 0.4 million of foreign currency translation loss during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.2 million of foreign currency translation loss during the nine months ended August 31, 2023. We recorded 0.9 million of interest income during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 0.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. We recorded a loss of 0.04 million from our South American joint venture investment during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to a loss of 0.6 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023. 

22

Income Tax Provision 
 For the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.1 million of income tax benefit and income tax benefit of 0.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate was 0.2 and 2.2 , respectively. Our tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21.0 due to the effects of state taxes net of federal benefit, the foreign tax rate differential as a result of Byrna South Africa, effects of permanent non-deductible expenses, the recording of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated in the current period, and other effects. 
 
 Net Income/(Loss) 
 Net income was 3.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, an improvement of 10.5 million compared to the net loss of 7.4 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2023.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 See Note 5, Recent Accounting Guidance, in the Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting standards. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 4, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 2023 10-K. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our 2023 10-K.

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company s CEO and CFO concluded that as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the normal course of business, the Company occasionally becomes involved in various legal proceedings. The results of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty because such matters are inherently uncertain. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. In our opinion, at this time, any liability from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024, as amended on March 29, 2024. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On July 31, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a program to buy back up to 10 million worth of shares of our Common Stock from the open market during a period of two years (the Stock Buyback Program ). The Stock Buyback Program is intended to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We repurchased 291,141 shares of our Common Stock under the Stock Buyback Program during the three months ended August 31, 2024. See Note 14 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Stock Buyback Program.
