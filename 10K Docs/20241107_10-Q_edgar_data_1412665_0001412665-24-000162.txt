 of the equity of DNVB through a merger and acquired its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Bank of Denver, for cash consideration of million. The primary reason for the acquisition was to increase our presence in Denver, Colorado. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, BOD was merged with and into the Bank. 
 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their fair values as of the January 31, 2024 acquisition date, net of any applicable tax effects using a methodology similar to the Company's legacy assets and liabilities (refer to Note 14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for additional information regarding the fair value methodology). Initial accounting for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was incomplete at September 30, 2024. Thus, such amounts recognized in the financial statements have been determined to be provisional. The excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The revenue and earnings amount specific to DNVB since the acquisition date that are included in the consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not readily determinable. The disclosures of these amounts are impracticable due to the merging of certain processes and systems at the acquisition date.

The decision to sell HTM securities necessitated the reclassification, on September 30, 2024, of all HTM securities to AFS.

 Loans with unpaid principal in the amount of billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for borrowings. 
 
 Non-accrual and Delinquent Status 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when (1) payment in full of principal and interest is no longer expected or (2) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more for all loan types, except owner occupied residential real estate, which are moved to non-accrual at 120 days or more past due, unless the loan is both well secured with marketable collateral and in the process of collection. All loans rated doubtful or worse, and certain loans rated substandard, are placed on non-accrual. 
 A non-accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when (1) all past due principal and interest has been paid (excluding renewals and modifications that involve the capitalizing of interest) or (2) the loan becomes well secured with marketable collateral and is in the process of collection. An established track record of performance is also considered when determining accrual status. 
 
 Loans are considered past due or delinquent when the contractual principal or interest due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or any portion thereof remains unpaid after the due date of the scheduled payment.

 Credit Quality Information 
 The Company aggregates loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, and other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogenous loans, such as agricultural, commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and non-owner occupied residential real estate loans. Loans not meeting the criteria described below that are analyzed individually are considered to be pass-rated. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Special Mention/Watch - A special mention/watch asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Special mention/watch assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 Substandard - Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 Loss - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 
 Homogenous loans, including owner occupied residential real estate and consumer loans, are not individually risk rated. Instead, these loans are categorized based on performance: performing and nonperforming. Nonperforming loans include those loans on nonaccrual and loans greater than 90 days past due and on accrual.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The following are the economic factors utilized by the Company for its loan credit loss estimation process at September 30, 2024, and the forecast for each factor at that date: (1) Midwest unemployment increase in the first forecasted quarter, with little change in the second through fourth forecasted quarters; (2) national unemployment - decreases over the next four forecasted quarters; (3) year-to-year change in national retail sales - increases over the next four forecasted quarters; (4) year-to-year change in CRE Index - decreases over the next two forecasted quarters, with increases in the third and fourth forecasted quarters; and (5) year-to-year change in U.S. GDP - increases over the next four forecasted quarters. In addition, management utilized qualitative factors to adjust the calculated ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management s judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. 
 
 The increase in the ACL between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflects million of day 1 credit loss expense related to acquired DNVB loans, as well as additional reserve taken to support loan growth. Partially offsetting these identified increases was a million reduction to the ACL for allowance allocated to the loans sold with our Florida banking operations. Net loan charge-offs were million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net loan charge-offs of million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net loan charge-offs of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We have made a policy election to report interest receivable as a separate line on the balance sheet. Accrued interest receivable, which is recorded within 'Other Assets', totaled million at September 30, 2024.

 Commitments to sell loans Standby letters of credit Total 
 The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, crops, livestock, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Commitments to sell loans are agreements to sell loans held for sale to third parties at an agreed upon price.

 This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We and our representatives may, from time to time, make written or oral statements that are forward-looking and provide information other than historical information. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. These factors include, among other things, the factors listed below. Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate, should, could, would, plans, intend, project, estimate, forecast, may or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Additionally, we undertake no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events, except as required under federal securities law. 
 
 Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results, growth plan goals and future prospects include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 the risks of mergers or branch sales (including the recent sale of our Florida banking operations and the acquisition of DNVB), including, without limitation, the related time and costs of implementing such transactions, integrating operations as part of these transactions and possible failures to achieve expected gains, revenue growth and/or expense savings from such transactions; 
 credit quality deterioration, pronounced and sustained reduction in real estate market values, or other uncertainties, including the impact of inflationary pressures on economic conditions and our business, resulting in an increase in the allowance for credit losses, an increase in the credit loss expense, and a reduction in net earnings; 
 the effects of changes in interest rates, including on our net income and the value of our securities portfolio; 
 changes in the economic environment, competition, or other factors that may affect our ability to acquire loans or influence the anticipated growth rate of loans and deposits and the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing; 
 fluctuations in the value of our investment securities; 
 governmental monetary and fiscal policies; 
 changes in and uncertainty related to benchmark interest rates used to price loans and deposits; 
 legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in banking, securities, trade, and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators and any changes in response to the failures of other banks; 
 the ability to attract and retain key executives and employees experienced in banking and financial services; 
 the sufficiency of the allowance for credit losses to absorb the amount of actual losses inherent in our existing loan portfolio; 
 our ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to compete effectively in the marketplace; 
 credit risks and risks from concentrations (by geographic area and by industry) within our loan portfolio; 
 the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and other mutual funds, financial technology companies, and other financial institutions operating in our markets or elsewhere or providing similar services; 
 the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of allowances for credit losses and estimation of values of collateral and various financial assets and liabilities; 
 volatility of rate-sensitive deposits; 
 operational risks, including data processing system failures or fraud;

 FINANCIAL SUMMARY 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company completed a common equity capital raise, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of 118.6 million to facilitate a balance sheet repositioning. Subsequent to quarter end, as part of the balance sheet repositioning, the Company sold 1.0 billion of debt securities, including securities previously classified as HTM. The decision to sell HTM securities necessitated the reclassification on September 30, 2024, of all HTM securities to AFS. On September 30, 2024, the HTM securities reclassified had an amortized cost basis of 1.04 billion and a fair value of 870.2 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an impairment loss of 140.4 million in pre-tax earnings associated with the securities sold in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The Company reported net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 95.7 million, a decrease of 104.8 million, compared to net income of 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with diluted (loss) earnings per share of (6.05) and 0.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusted earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.1 million, compared to 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) of 0.58 and 0.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net loss of 76.6 million, a decrease of 94.7 million, compared to net income of 18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with diluted (loss) earnings per share of (4.86) and 1.15 for the respective annual nine month periods. Adjusted earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 21.8 million, compared to 28.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) of 1.38 and 1.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 The periods as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also highlighted by the following results: 
 
 Balance Sheet: 
 Total assets increased to 6.55 billion at September 30, 2024 from 6.43 billion at December 31, 2023, driven primarily by acquired DNVB assets, organic loan growth and higher line of credit usage, partially offset by loans divested in the sale of our Florida banking operations and lower investment securities balances stemming primarily from the third quarter of 2024 balance sheet repositioning. 
 Total debt securities available for sale at September 30, 2024, were 1.62 billion. There were no held to maturity debt securities on September 30, 2024 as all securities previously classified as held to maturity were classified as available for sale during the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the balance sheet repositioning. There were 1.08 billion of held to maturity debt securities at December 31, 2023, while the total amount of debt securities available for sale was 795.1 million at that date. 
 Gross loans held for investment increased 206.2 million, from 4.14 billion at December 31, 2023 to 4.34 billion at September 30, 2024, due primarily to acquired DNVB loans, organic loan growth, and higher line of credit usage, partially offset by the sale of loans associated with our Florida banking operations. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 54.0 million, or 1.25 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 51.5 million, or 1.25 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL primarily reflected 3.1 million of day 1 credit loss expense related to acquired DNVB loans, as well as an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth, partially offset by 1.9 million of allowance divested in the sale of our Florida banking operations. 
 Nonperforming assets declined 4.8 million, from 30.3 million at December 31, 2023, to 25.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Total deposits decreased 26.9 million, from 5.40 billion at December 31, 2023, to 5.37 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Short-term borrowings increased to 410.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 300.3 million at December 31, 2023, and long-term debt decreased to 115.1 million at September 30, 2024, from 123.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company was well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.96 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Statement: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Tax equivalent net interest income (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) was 38.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3.1 million, from 35.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in tax equivalent net interest income was due primarily to an increase of 10.9 million in loan interest income, partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease in investment securities interest income, coupled with an increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds of 6.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively. 
 Credit loss expense of 1.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2024, compared to credit loss expense of 1.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Credit loss expense in the third quarter of 2024 reflected an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth, offset by a reduction of 0.3 million in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. 
 Noninterest income decreased 140.2 million, from 9.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, to noninterest loss of 130.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning-related securities impairment of 140.4 million. 
 Noninterest expense increased 4.3 million, from 31.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, to 35.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increases in all noninterest expense categories, except marketing and communications. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Tax equivalent net interest income (a non-GAAP financial measure - see the "Non-GAAP Presentations" section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent) was 112.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.6 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds of 27.2 million and 7.6 million, respectively, in addition to a decrease of 3.3 million in interest income earned from investment securities. Partially offsetting these identified decreases in tax equivalent net interest income was an increase of 34.7 million in loan interest income. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 Credit loss expense of 7.5 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to credit loss expense of 4.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. Credit loss expense in the first nine months of 2024 reflected 3.2 million of expense for acquired DNVB loans, an additional liability of 0.6 million for unfunded loan commitments, coupled with an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth. 
 Noninterest income decreased 113.6 million, from 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to noninterest loss of 99.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning-related securities impairment of 140.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this decrease was a 10.9 million gain on sale recognized in connection with the sale of our Florida banking operations, which was recorded in other noninterest income in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Noninterest expense increased 7.3 million, from 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 107.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to increases of 3.3 million, 1.5 million, and 1.5 million in compensation and employee benefits, legal and professional, and other expense, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline of 1.1 million in marketing expense. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management has identified the accounting policies related to the ACL, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, and the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical accounting policies. Information about our critical accounting estimates is included under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024, and there have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

 Our tax equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 38.8 million, an increase of 3.1 million, or 8.7 , compared to 35.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in tax equivalent net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due primarily to an increase of 10.9 million, or 20.7 , in loan interest income stemming from higher yields coupled with increased volumes from acquired DNVB loans, organic loan growth, and additional line of credit usage. The increased loan volumes were partially offset by the sale of loans associated with our Florida banking operations. Partially offsetting this increase in loan interest income was a decrease of 1.0 million, or 8.5 , in interest income earned from investment securities, which stemmed from lower volumes of securities, and increases in interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds of 6.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively, stemming from higher costs on interest bearing deposits and increased volumes of borrowed funds. 
 The tax equivalent net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 improved to 2.51 from 2.35 for the third quarter of 2023, driven by higher earning asset yields, partially offset by higher funding costs. Total earning asset yield increased 58 basis points ("bps") from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a 67 bps increase in loan yields. Funding costs increased 54 bps to 2.87 , due to interest bearing deposit costs of 2.58 , short-term borrowing costs of 4.76 , and long-term debt costs of 6.91 , which increased 53 bps, 47 bps and 13 bps, respectively, from the third quarter of 2023. 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 Credit loss expense of 1.5 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.6 million of credit loss expense recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Credit loss expense in the third quarter of 2024 reflected an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth, offset by a reduction of 0.3 million in the liability for unfunded loan commitments. Net charge-offs were 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 0.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The estimation model utilized by the Company is sensitive to changes in the following forecast inputs: (1) Midwest and national unemployment, (2) year-to-year change in national retail sales, (3) year-to-year change in the CRE Index, and (4) year-to-year change in U.S. GDP. In addition, management utilized qualitative factors to adjust the calculated ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management s judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions.

 (130,388) 9,861 (140,249) n/m (n/m) - Not meaningful 
 Total noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 140.2 million to a noninterest loss of 130.4 million, from noninterest income of 9.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning-related securities impairment of 140.4 million. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income was a decrease of 0.7 million in loan revenue, primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year change of 1.3 million in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, which was partially offset by an increase of 0.5 million in SBA gain on sale. Partially offsetting these decreases in total noninterest income was an increase of 0.4 million in investment securities and trust activities revenue, driven by growth in assets under administration and transaction fees, and an increase of 0.3 million in bank-owned life insurance due primarily to 0.2 million of death benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2024.

 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.3 million, or 13.5 , to 35.8 million from 31.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, due to increases in all noninterest expense categories, except marketing and communications. The largest

Table of Contents 

 contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were increases of 1.5 million, 1.4 million, and 0.6 million in other, compensation and employee benefits, and legal and professional expenses, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily driven by a 1.2 million fraud loss recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense was driven by annual compensation adjustments and increased incentive and commission expense. The increase in legal and professional expense stemmed from increased costs for legal fees, consulting, personnel procurement, merger-related expenses, and accounting and tax fees. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline of 0.2 million in marketing expense.

 Our effective income tax rate, or income tax expense divided by income before income tax expense, was 26.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an effective tax rate of 19.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the investment security impairments recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate for the full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of 27 to 29 .

Our tax equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 112.5 million, a decrease of 2.6 million, or 2.3 , compared to 115.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in tax equivalent net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds of 27.2 million and 7.6 million, respectively, due to higher costs and volumes of interest bearing deposits, coupled with higher volumes of borrowed funds, partially offset by lower costs of borrowed funds. The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income was also due to a decrease of 3.3 million, or 8.8 , in interest income earned from investment securities, which stemmed from lower volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 34.7 million, or 23.1 , in loan interest income due to higher yields coupled with increased volumes from acquired DNVB loans, organic loan growth, and additional line of credit usage. The increased loan volumes were partially offset by the sale of loans associated with our Florida banking operations. 
 
 The tax equivalent net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.42 , or 12 bps lower than the tax equivalent net interest margin of 2.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 79 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the cost of borrowed funds increased 91 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting these identified decreases to tax equivalent net interest margin from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was the increase in loan yields of 62 bps, which primarily reflected new loan production originated at higher yields. 
 Credit Loss Expense 
 Credit loss expense of 7.5 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to credit loss expense of 4.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. Credit loss expense in the first nine months of 2024 reflected 3.2 million of day 1 credit loss expense related to the DNVB acquisition, an additional liability of 0.6 million on unfunded loan commitments, and additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 were 2.4 million, as compared to net charge-offs of 1.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The estimation model utilized by the Company is sensitive to changes in the following forecast inputs: (1) Midwest and national unemployment, (2) year-to-year change in national retail sales, (3) year-to-year change in the CRE Index, and (4) year-to-year change in U.S. GDP. In addition, management utilized qualitative factors to adjust the calculated ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management s judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of

 specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The following table presents the significant components of noninterest income and the related dollar and percentage change from period to period: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Investment services and trust activities 10,417 9,056 1,361 15.0 Service charges and fees 6,470 6,201 269 4.3 Card revenue 5,785 5,412 373 6.9 Loan revenue 3,141 3,791 (650) (17.1) Bank-owned life insurance 2,207 1,844 363 19.7 Investment securities (losses) gains, net (140,113) (13,093) (127,020) n/m Other 13,009 1,350 11,659 n/m Total noninterest income 
 (99,084) 14,561 (113,645) n/m (n/m) - Not meaningful 
 Total noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 113.6 million to a noninterest loss of 99.1 million, from noninterest income of 14.6 million during the same period of 2023, primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning-related securities impairment of 140.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a larger loss than the 13.2 million of investment securities losses, net, recorded in the first quarter of 2023 related to a smaller volume balance sheet repositioning. The largest offset to this decrease in total noninterest income was an 11.7 million increase in other noninterest income due primarily to the 10.9 million gain on sale of assets associated with our Florida banking operations. Further offsetting the decline in total noninterest income was a 1.4 million increase in investment services and trust activities revenue, driven by growth in assets under administration and transaction fees. 
 Noninterest Expense

 2,301 147 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 107.1 million, an increase of 7.3 million, or 7.4 , from 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of 3.3 million, 1.5 million, and 1.5 million in compensation and employee benefits, legal and professional, and other expenses, respectively. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense was primarily driven by annual compensation adjustments, increased headcount as a result of the DNVB acquisition, increased incentive and commission expense, and merger-related expenses. The increase in legal and professional expense stemmed primarily from higher merger-related expenses. The increase in other expense stemmed primarily from a 1.2 million fraud loss recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline of 1.1 million in marketing expense. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Our effective income tax rate, or income tax expense divided by income before tax expense, was 27.1 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to an effective tax rate of 18.7 for the first nine months of 2023. The increase reflected the impact of the investment security impairments recorded in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning, taxable income attributed to the Florida banking operations sale exceeding book income due to the non-deductible goodwill allocated to the Florida banking operations, and a decreased benefit from tax exempt income. The effective tax rate for the full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of 27 to 29 .

 Total investment securities at September 30, 2024 decreased 247.2 million, or 13.22 , from December 31, 2023 to 1.62 billion. This decrease stemmed from impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning, fair value adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the reclassification of held to maturity securities to available for sale, and principal cash flows received from scheduled payments, calls, and maturities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 374 thousand of gross unrealized gains and 78.7 million of gross unrealized losses in our debt securities available for sale portfolio for a net unrealized loss of 78.3 million.

 Loan Review and Classification Process for Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial, and Commercial Real Estate Loans: 
 The Bank maintains a loan review and classification process which involves multiple officers of the Bank and is designed to assess the general quality of credit underwriting and to promote early identification of potential problem loans. All commercial and agricultural loan officers are charged with the responsibility of risk rating all loans in their portfolios and updating the ratings, positively or negatively, on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Risk ratings are selected from an 8-point scale with ratings as follows: ratings 1- 4 Satisfactory (pass), rating 5 Special Mention/Watch (potential weakness), rating 6 Substandard (well-defined weakness), rating 7 Doubtful, and rating 8 Loss. 
 When a loan officer originates a new loan, based upon proper loan authorization, they document the credit file with an offering sheet summary, supplemental underwriting analysis, relevant financial information and collateral evaluations. This information is used in the determination of the initial loan risk rating. Segregation of owner-occupied and non-owner occupied residential real estate loans is made at the time of origination. The Bank s loan review department undertakes independent credit reviews of relationships based on either criteria established by loan policy, risk-focused sampling, or random sampling. Credit relationships with larger exposure may pose incrementally higher risks. As a result, the Bank's loan review department is required to review all credit relationships with total exposure of 7.5 million or more at least annually. In addition, the individual loan reviews consider such items as: loan type; nature, type and estimated value of collateral; borrower and/or guarantor estimated financial strength; most recently available financial information; related loans and total borrower exposure; and current and anticipated performance of the loan. The results of such reviews are presented to both executive management and the audit committee of the Company's board of directors. 
 
 Through the review of delinquency reports, updated financial statements or other relevant information, the lending officer and/or loan review personnel may determine that a loan relationship has weakened to the point that a Special Mention/Watch (risk 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 rating 5) or Classified (risk ratings 6 through 8) status is warranted. At least quarterly, the loan strategy committee will meet to discuss loan relationships with total exposure of 1.0 million or above that are Special Mention/Watch rated credits, loan relationships with total exposure of 500 thousand and above that are Substandard or worse rated credits, as well as loan relationships with total exposure of 250 thousand and above that are on non-accrual. Loan relationships outside these designated thresholds are reviewed upon request. The lending officer is charged with preparing a loan strategy summary worksheet that outlines the background of the credit problem, current repayment status of the loans, current collateral evaluation and a workout plan of action. This plan may include goals to improve the credit rating, assist the borrower in moving the loans to another institution and/or collateral liquidation. All such reports are presented to the loan strategy committee. The minutes of the loan strategy committee meetings are provided to the board of directors of the Bank. 
 
 Depending upon the individual facts and circumstances and the result of the classified/watch review process, loan officers and/or loan review personnel may categorize a loan relationship as requiring an individual analysis. Once that determination has occurred, the credit analyst will complete an individually analyzed worksheet that contains an evaluation of the collateral (for collateral-dependent loans) based upon the estimated collateral value, adjusting for current market conditions and other local factors that may affect collateral value. Loan review personnel may also complete an independent individual analysis when deemed necessary. These judgmental evaluations may produce an initial specific allowance for recognition in the Company s allowance for credit losses calculation. An analysis for the underlying collateral value of each individually analyzed loan relationship is completed in the last month of the quarter. The individually analyzed worksheets are reviewed by the Credit Administration department prior to quarter-end. The board of directors of the Bank on a quarterly basis reviews the classified/watch reports including changes in credit grades of 5 or higher as well as all individually analyzed loans, the related allowances and foreclosed assets, net. 
 
 The review process also provides for the upgrade of loans that show improvement since the last review. All requests for an upgrade of a credit are approved by the proper authority based upon the aggregate credit exposure before the rating can be changed. 
 
 Loan Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 Infrequently, the Company makes modification to certain loans in order to alleviate temporary difficulties in the borrower's financial condition and/or constraints on the borrower's ability to repay a loan, and to minimize potential losses to the Company. GAAP requires that certain types of modifications be reported, including: 
 
 Principal forgiveness. 
 Interest rate reduction. 
 An other than-insignificant payment delay. 
 Term extension. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the loans that were modified to borrowers in financial distress was 2.6 million, which represented 0.06 of total loans held for investment, net of unearned income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the loans that were modified to borrowers in financial distress was 8.9 million, which represented 0.21 of total loans held for investment, net of unearned income.

 Actual Results: Our ACL as of September 30, 2024 was 54.0 million, which was 1.25 of loans held for investment, net of unearned income as of that date. This compares with an ACL of 51.5 million as of December 31, 2023, which was 1.25 of loans held for investment, net of unearned income. The increase in the ACL primarily reflected the 3.1 million of day 1 credit

 loss expense related to the acquired DNVB loans, as well as an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth, partially offset by the 1.9 million of allowance divested in the sale of our Florida banking operations. The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled 5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 4.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and is included in 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet. 
 The Company recorded a credit loss expense related to loans of 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to credit loss expense related to loans of 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 3.4 million, while there were 0.9 million in gross recoveries of previously charged-off loans. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.08 compared to 0.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Economic Forecast: At September 30, 2024, the economic forecast used by the Company showed the following: (1) Midwest unemployment increase in the first forecasted quarter, with little change in the second through fourth forecasted quarters; (2) national unemployment - decreases over the next four forecasted quarters; (3) year-to-year change in national retail sales - increases over the next four forecasted quarters; (4) year-to-year change in CRE Index - decreases over the next two forecasted quarters, with increases in the third and fourth forecasted quarters; and (5) year-to-year change in U.S. GDP - increases over the next four forecasted quarters. In addition, management utilized qualitative factors to adjust the calculated ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management s judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. 
 Loan Policy: We review all nonaccrual relationships greater than 250 thousand individually on a quarterly basis to measure any amount to be recognized in the Company's allowance for credit losses by analyzing the borrower's ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, and other relevant factors. We review loans 90 days or more past due that are still accruing interest no less than quarterly to determine if the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection. If not, such loans are placed on non-accrual status. Upon the Company's determination that a loan balance has been deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible balance is charged-off. 
 Based on the inherent risk in the loan portfolio, management believed that, as of September 30, 2024, the ACL was adequate; however, there is no assurance losses will not exceed the ACL. In addition, growth in the loan portfolio or general economic deterioration may require the recognition of additional credit loss expense in future periods. See Note 4. Loans Receivable and the Allowance for Credit Losses to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

 22.43 27.90 (1) A non-GAAP financial measure - see the Non-GAAP Presentations section for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP equivalent. 
 
 Shareholders' Equity: Total shareholders equity was 562.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 524.4 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 37.9 million, or 7.2 , due primarily to an increase in the balance of common stock and additional paid-in-capital stemming from the common stock capital raise executed in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decline in retained earnings. 
 Capital Adequacy: Risk-based capital guidelines require the classification of assets and some off-balance-sheet items in terms of credit-risk exposure and the measuring of capital as a percentage of the risk-adjusted asset totals. Management believed that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. As of that date, the Bank was well capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions. See Note 12. Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions on Subsidiary Cash to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our capital. 
 Stock Compensation 
 Restricted stock units were granted to certain officers of the Company on February 15, 2024, in the aggregate amount of 104,326. In the second quarter, restricted stock units were also granted to directors of the Company and the Bank on May 15, 2024, in the aggregate amount of 17,264. During the third quarter, restricted stock units were granted to certain officers of the Company on August 15, 2024, in the aggregate amount of 5,968. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2024, 103,961 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the vesting of previously awarded grants of restricted stock units, of which 22,398 shares were surrendered by grantees to satisfy tax requirements, and 7,030 unvested restricted stock units were forfeited.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity risk management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers. We conduct liquidity risk management on both a daily and long-term basis, and adjust our investments in liquid assets based on expected loan demand, projected loan maturities and payments, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-bearing deposits, and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Generally, excess liquidity is invested in short-term U.S. government and agency securities, short- and medium-term state and political subdivision securities, and other investment securities. Our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits, and federal funds sold. The balances of these assets are dependent on our operating, investing, and financing activities during any given period. 
 Cash and cash equivalents are summarized in the table below: 
 (dollars in thousands) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Cash and due from banks 72,173 76,237 Interest-bearing deposits 129,695 5,479 Federal funds sold 11 Total 201,868 81,727 
 Generally, our principal sources of funds are deposits, advances from the FHLB, principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities, our federal funds lines, and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan amortization and maturing interest-bearing deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions, the general level of interest rates, and competition. We utilized particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability. The Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with several correspondent banks and secured lines with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the FHLB that would allow us to borrow funds on a short-term basis, if necessary. We also hold debt securities classified as available for sale that could be sold to meet liquidity needs if necessary. 
 Net cash provided by operations was another major source of liquidity. The net cash provided by operating activities was 32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 55.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Inflation 
 The effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions. While management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets, it is difficult to assess its overall impact on the Company. The price of one or more of the components of the Consumer Price Index may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall Consumer Price Index without having a corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us. Inflation and related increases in market rates by the Federal Reserve generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings and shareholders' equity. Ongoing higher inflation levels and higher interest rates could have a negative impact on both our consumer and commercial borrowers. We anticipate our noninterest income may be adversely affected in future periods as a result of sustained high interest rates and inflationary pressure, which negatively impact mortgage originations and mortgage banking revenue. Additionally, the economic impact of the sustained higher levels of inflation and higher interest rates could place increased demand on our liquidity if we experience significant credit deterioration and as we meet borrowers' needs. There is also a risk that additional interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession. 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 During the normal course of business, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, and standby letters of credit. We follow the same credit policy (including requiring collateral, if deemed appropriate) to make such commitments as is followed for those loans that are recorded in our financial statements. 
 Our exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance is represented by the contractual amount of the commitments. Management does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments, and also expects to have sufficient liquidity available to cover these off-balance-sheet instruments. Off-balance-sheet transactions are more fully discussed in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations existing at December 31, 2023, as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 In general, market risk is the risk of change in asset values due to movements in underlying market rates and prices. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us as other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities. 
 In addition to interest rate risk, economic conditions in recent years have made liquidity risk (namely, funding liquidity risk) a more prevalent concern among financial institutions. In general, liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to fund an entity s obligations to creditors (including, in the case of banks, obligations to depositors) as such obligations become due and/or fund its acquisition of assets. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to fund operations, to meet depositor withdrawals, to provide for our customers credit needs, and to meet maturing obligations and existing commitments. Our liquidity principally depends on cash flows from operating activities, investment in and maturity of assets, changes in balances of deposits and borrowings, and our ability to borrow funds. 
 Net cash inflows from operating activities were 32.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 55.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. Net cash inflows from investing activities were 35.3 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to net cash inflows of 83.1 million in the comparable nine month period of 2023. Net cash inflows from financing

Table of Contents 

 activities in the first nine months of 2024 were 52.8 million, compared with net cash outflows of 150.5 million for the same period of 2023. 
 To manage liquidity risk, the Bank has several sources of liquidity in place to maximize funding availability and increase the diversification of funding sources. The criteria for evaluating the use of these sources include volume concentration (percentage of liabilities), cost, volatility, and the fit with the current asset/liability management plan. These acceptable sources of liquidity include: 
 Federal Funds Lines 
 Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window/Bank Term Funding Program 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
 Brokered Deposits 
 Brokered Repurchase Agreements 
 Federal Funds Lines - Federal funds positions provide a source of short-term liquidity funding for the Bank. Unsecured federal funds purchased lines are viewed as a volatile liability and are not used as a long-term funding solution, especially when used to fund long-term assets. The current federal funds purchased limit is 10 of total assets, or the amount of established federal funds lines, whichever is smaller. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintains several unsecured federal funds lines totaling 135.0 million, which lines are tested annually to ensure availability. 
 Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program - The Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and the BTFP are additional sources of liquidity, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or stress. Effective March 11, 2024, no new loans will be made under the BTFP. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had investment securities consisting primarily of corporate debt, state and political subdivisions, mortgage backed, and collateralized mortgage obligations, with an approximate market value of 744.3 million, pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for liquidity purposes and had additional borrowing capacity of 396.5 million. There were no outstanding borrowings through the FRB Discount Window at September 30, 2024. There were 405.0 million of Bank Term Funding Program borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the debt securities to pay-off the Bank Term Funding Program borrowings outstanding, including accrued interest. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances - FHLB advances provide both a source of liquidity and long-term funding for the Bank. All credit exposure, including advances and federal funds borrowings from the FHLBDM are collateralized primarily by one- to four-family residential, commercial and agricultural real estate first mortgages equal to various percentages of the total outstanding notes. The current credit limit established by the FHLBDM is equal to 45 of the Bank's total assets. This credit capacity limit includes short-term and long-term borrowings, federal funds, letters of credit, and other sources of credit exposure to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had no short-term FHLB advances and 3.2 million in long-term FHLB borrowings and additional borrowing capacity of 684.3 million. 
 Brokered Deposits and Reciprocal Deposits - The Bank has brokered time deposit and non-maturity deposit relationships available to diversify its funding sources. Brokered deposits offer several benefits relative to other funding sources, such as: maturity structures which cannot be duplicated in the current retail market, deposit gathering which does not cannibalize the existing deposit base, the unsecured nature of these liabilities, and the ability to quickly generate funds. The Bank s internal policy limits the use of brokered deposits as a funding source to no more than 20 of total assets. Board approval is required to exceed this limit. The Bank must maintain a well capitalized rating to access brokered deposits without FDIC waiver. An adequately capitalized rating requires an FDIC waiver to access brokered deposits and an undercapitalized rating prohibits the Bank from using brokered deposits. The Company had brokered deposits of 200.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 221.0 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Under a final rule that was issued by the FDIC in December 2018, financial institutions that are considered "well capitalized" qualify for the exemption of certain reciprocal deposits from being considered brokered deposits. Such exemption is limited to the lesser of 20 percent of total liabilities or 5.0 billion, with some exceptions for financial institutions that do not meet such criteria. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 23.7 million of reciprocal time deposits, 130.9 million of reciprocal interest bearing non-maturity deposits, and 97.8 million non-interest bearing non-maturity deposits that qualified for the brokered deposit exemption. These reciprocal deposits are part of the IntraFi Network Deposits program, which is used by financial institutions to spread deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance coverage limits out to numerous institutions in order to provide insurance coverage for all participating deposits.

Brokered Repurchase Agreements - Brokered repurchase agreements may be established with approved brokerage firms and banks. Repurchase agreements create rollover risk (the risk that a broker will discontinue the relationship due to market factors) and are not used as a long-term funding solution, especially when used to fund long-term assets. Collateral requirements and availability are evaluated and monitored. The current policy limit for brokered repurchase agreements is 15 of total assets. There were no outstanding brokered repurchase agreements at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of net interest income and fair value of financial instruments (interest-earning assets, deposits and borrowings) to movements in interest rates. The Company s results of operations depend to a large degree on its net interest income and its ability to manage interest rate risk. The Company considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk. The major sources of the Company s interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, changes in customer behavior and changes in relationships between rate indices (basis risk). Management measures these risks and their impact in various ways, including through the use of income simulation and valuation analyses. Multiple interest rate scenarios are used in this analysis which include changes in interest rates, spread narrowing and widening, yield curve twists and changes in assumptions about customer behavior in various interest rate scenarios. A mismatch between maturities, interest rate sensitivities and prepayment characteristics of assets and liabilities results in interest-rate risk. Like most financial institutions, we have material interest-rate risk exposure to changes in both short-term and long-term interest rates, as well as variable interest rate indices (e.g., the prime rate or SOFR). 
 The Bank s asset and liability committee meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing its interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. Our asset and liability committee seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring our balance sheet and off-balance-sheet positions in such a way that changes in interest rates do not have a large negative impact. The risk is monitored and managed within approved policy limits. 
 
 We use a third-party service to model and measure our exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, numerous other assumptions are made, such as prepayment speeds on loans and securities backed by mortgages, the slope of the Treasury yield-curve, the rates and volumes of our deposits, and the rates and volumes of our loans. There are two primary tools used to evaluate interest rate risk: net interest income simulation and economic value of equity ("EVE"). In addition, interest rate gap is reviewed to monitor asset and liability repricing over various time periods. 
 
 Net Interest Income Simulation - Management utilizes net interest income simulation models to estimate the near-term effects of changing interest rates on its net interest income. Net interest income simulation involves projecting net interest income under a variety of scenarios, which include varying the level of interest rates and shifts in the shape of the yield curve. Management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions regarding events that management can influence, such as non-contractual deposit re-pricings, and events outside management s control, such as customer behavior on loan and deposit activity and the effect that competition has on both loan and deposit pricing. These assumptions are subjective and, as a result, net interest income simulation results will differ from actual results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management strategies, among other factors. We perform various sensitivity analyses on assumptions of deposit attrition and deposit re-pricing. 
 The following table presents the anticipated effect on net interest income over a twelve month period if short- and long-term interest rates were to sustain an immediate decrease of 100 bps or 200 bps, or an immediate increase of 100 bps or 200 bps: 
 Immediate Change in Rates (dollars in thousands) -200 -100 +100 +200 September 30, 2024 Dollar change 
 (5,989) (2,588) 2,936 5,563 Percent change 
 (3.5) (1.5) 1.7 3.3 December 31, 2023 Dollar change 
 1,280 (347) 229 111 Percent change 
 0.9 (0.2) 0.2 0.1 
 As of September 30, 2024, 39.9 of the Company s earning asset balances will reprice or are expected to pay down in the next twelve months, and 40.0 of the Company s deposit balances are low cost or no cost deposits.

 Economic Value of Equity - Management also uses EVE to measure risk in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis. Net interest income simulation highlights exposure over a relatively short time period, while EVE analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows. EVE analysis addresses only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the run-off replacement assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, EVE analysis is based on key assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows and does not take into account any potential responses by management to anticipated changes in interest rates. 
 Interest Rate Gap - The interest rate gap is the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities re-pricing within a given period and represents the net asset or liability sensitivity at a point in time. An interest rate gap measure could be significantly affected by external factors such as loan prepayments, early withdrawals of deposits, changes in the correlation of various interest-bearing instruments, competition, or a rise or decline in interest rates. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors or fraud or ensure that all material information will be made known to appropriate management in a timely fashion. By their nature, our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
