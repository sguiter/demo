 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2024 are subject to significant seasonal variations and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 27, 2024. For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. 
 
 We are required to evaluate events occurring after September 27, 2024 for recognition and disclosure in the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter and nine months ended September 27, 2024. Events are evaluated based on whether they represent information existing as of September 27, 2024, which require recognition in the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, or new events occurring after September 27, 2024 which do not require recognition but require disclosure if the event is significant to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluated events occurring subsequent to September 27, 2024 through the date of issuance of these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

shareholder of one of the acquired subsidiaries. The put option allowed the noncontrolling shareholder to sell its noncontrolling interest to us for a multiple of the subsidiary's adjusted earnings. As the put option was outside of our control, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of permanent equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At each reporting period, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recognized at the higher of (1) the initial carrying amount adjusted for accumulated earnings and distributions or (2) the contractually-defined redemption value as of the balance sheet date. 
 
 During the year ended December 29, 2023, the noncontrolling shareholder exercised its put option right and accordingly, we closed the purchase of the remaining of this subsidiary for million in cash consideration. The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, with the differential between the redeemable noncontrolling interest carrying amount at the time of closing and the cash purchase price being recognized as a million increase in paid-in capital within shareholders' equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This ASU amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 to enhance the nature and frequency of segment disclosures. Specifically, the update requires disclosure of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") included within the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss, the amount and composition of other segment items in order to reconcile to the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss, the CODM's title and position, and how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires that annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets required by Topic 280 be made in interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of this ASU and concluded it has no impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This ASU amends ASC 740 to enhance the nature of disclosures for income taxes. Specifically, the ASU requires public business entities to disclose additional information in categories defined within the ASU within the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state and foreign income taxes. Additionally, the ASU requires disclosure of taxes paid, net of refunds received, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of this ASU and concluded it has no impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 foreign jurisdictions, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to transfer pricing aggregating approximately million (including interest and penalties) for tax years 2012 through 2016. We strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments and have filed a protest with each of the taxing authorities. 
 
 In one of the foreign jurisdictions, we are currently contesting tax assessments related to the 2012-2015 audit years and the 2016 audit year in both the administrative court and the judicial court. During 2019 and 2020, we filed actions contesting the tax assessment in the administrative office. Our initial challenge to each of these tax assessments was rejected, and we subsequently lost our appeals at the administrative court. We have subsequently filed actions to contest each of these tax assessments in the country s judicial courts. In addition, we have filed a request for injunction to the judicial court to stay the tax authorities' collection efforts for these two tax assessments, pending final judicial decisions. The court granted our injunction with respect to the 2016 audit year, however denied our injunction with respect to the 2012-2015 audit years. We timely appealed the denial of the injunction, and on August 10, 2022 the appellate court overturned the denial and granted our injunction for the 2012-2015 audit years with a trial date set for July 4, 2025. Pursuant to local law, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair market value of million in connection with the grant of the 2016 audit year injunction. This real estate collateral has a net book value of million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. In addition, in connection with the grant of the 2012-2015 audit year injunction, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair market value of million, and a net book value of million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. The registration of this real estate collateral does not affect our operations in the country. 
 
 In the other foreign jurisdiction, the administrative court denied our appeal, and on March 4, 2020 we filed an action in the judicial court to contest the administrative court's decision. The case is still pending. 
 
 We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments and intend to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary in both jurisdictions to resolve the matters, which could be a lengthy process. 
 
 Additionally, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework. Pursuant to the implementation dates prescribed in the Directive, it is expected the rules will be effective for the Company for the 2025 fiscal year. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries, however, we may not be able to completely mitigate the impact of the legislation which could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 million for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared with million for the quarter ended September 29, 2023 and was million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared with million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The increase in both periods is primarily due to increased earnings in certain higher tax jurisdictions partially offset by the prior year tax effects related to the sale of stock of a subsidiary and asset sales in Saudi Arabia and North America.

 million and million, net of allowances of million and million, respectively. Our allowance for trade receivables as of September 27, 2024 consists of two components: a million allowance for credit losses and a million allowance for customer claims accounted for under the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition . As of December 29, 2023, our allowance for trade receivables consisted of a million allowance for credit losses and a million allowance for customer claims accounted for under the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition . 
 
 As a result of our robust credit monitoring practices, the industry in which we operate, and the nature of our customer base, the credit losses associated with our trade receivables have historically been insignificant in comparison to our annual net sales. We measure the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. We generally pool our trade receivables based on the geographic region or country to which the receivables relate. Receivables that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated for collectability on an individual basis. 
 
 Our historical credit loss experience provides the basis for our estimation of expected credit losses. We generally use a average annual loss rate as a starting point for our estimation, and make adjustments to the historical loss rate to account for differences in current conditions impacting the collectability of our receivable pools. We generally monitor macroeconomic indicators to assess whether adjustments are necessary to reflect current conditions.

Financing Receivables 
 
 Financing receivables are included in other accounts receivable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized at amortized cost less an allowance for estimated credit losses. Financing receivables include seasonal advances to growers and suppliers, which are usually short-term in nature, and other financing receivables. 
 
 A significant portion of the fresh produce we sell is acquired through supply contracts with independent growers. In order to ensure the consistent high quality of our products and packaging, we make advances to independent growers and suppliers. These growers and suppliers typically sell all of their production to us and make payments on their advances as a deduction to the agreed upon selling price of the fruit or packaging material. The majority of the advances to growers and suppliers are for terms less than and typically span a growing season. In certain cases, there may be longer term advances with terms of up to .

 (1) The 2023 PSUs were forfeited during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 as a result of not meeting the performance metric. 
 
 Under the 2022 Plan and Prior Plan, each RSU/PSU represents a contingent right to receive of our ordinary shares. The PSUs are subject to meeting minimum performance criteria set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined based on the results achieved versus performance goals. Those performance goals are based on exceeding a measure of our earnings. Depending on the results achieved, the actual number of shares that an award recipient receives at the end of the period may range from to of the award units granted, or as it relates to the 2024 and 2023 PSU awards granted to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to of the award units granted. Provided such criteria are met, the PSUs granted during 2024, 2023 and prior to 2022 vest in equal annual installments on each of the next anniversary dates. PSUs granted during 2022 vest in equal installments in 1) June and July 2023, 2) March 2024, and 3) March 2025. All PSU vesting is contingent on the recipient's continued employment with us. 
 
 Expense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. RSUs granted in 2023 and 2021 vest annually in equal installments over a service period while RSUs granted prior to 2021 vested on the grant date, with vesting on each of the next anniversaries. RSUs granted in 2022 vest in equal installments in June 2023, March 2024 and March 2025. RSUs granted to our Board of Directors generally vest after a one-year period. 
 
 The fair market value for RSUs and PSUs is based on the closing price of our stock on the grant date. We recognize expenses related to RSUs and PSUs based on the fair market value, as determined on the grant date, ratably over the vesting period, provided the performance condition, if any, is probable. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

 On October 1, 2019, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Second A R Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and BofA Securities, Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner and certain other lenders. The Second A R Credit Agreement provided for a , billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on October 1, 2024. The Second A R Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on December 30, 2022, to replace the Eurocurrency Rate with the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR" effective January 3, 2023. 
 
 On February 21, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2024 Amended Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and BofA Securities, Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner and certain other lenders. The 2024 Amended Credit Facility provides for a , billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 21, 2029. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to the Term SOFR rate plus a margin that ranges from to based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility). The 2024 Amended Credit Facility also permits, under certain conditions, million of Permitted Receivables Financing (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility). In addition, we pay a fee on unused commitments at a rate equal to to based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio.

 million Incremental Increases ). The aggregate amount of Incremental Increases can be further increased to the extent that after giving effect to the proposed increase in revolving credit facility commitments or term loans our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on a pro forma basis, would not exceed to 1.00. Our ability to request such increases or term loans is subject to our compliance with customary conditions set forth in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with certain financial covenants and ratios. Upon our request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or provide term loans. 
 
 The 2024 Amended Credit Facility contains similar financial covenants to those included within the Second A R Credit Agreement. Specifically, it requires us to maintain 1) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not more than to 1.00 at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, subject to certain exceptions and 2) minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Additionally, it requires us to comply with certain other covenants, including limitations on capital investments, the amount of dividends that can be paid in the future, the amounts and types of liens and indebtedness, material asset sales, and mergers. Under the 2024 Amended Credit Facility, we are permitted to declare or pay cash dividends in any fiscal year up to an amount that does not exceed the greater of (i) an amount equal to (1) the greater of (A) of the Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility) for the immediately preceding fiscal year or (B) (the "Base Dividend Basket") plus (2) commencing in the fiscal year ending December 26, 2025 any portion of the Base Dividend Basket not used in the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (ii) the greatest amount which would not cause the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (determined on a pro forma basis as of the date of declaration or payment) to exceed to 1.00. It also provides an allowance for stock repurchases to be an amount not exceeding the greater of (i) (A) (the "Base Redemption Basket") plus (B) commencing in the fiscal year ending December 26, 2025, any portion of the Base Redemption Basket not used in the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) the greatest amount which would not cause the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (determined on a pro forma basis as of the date of such repurchase) to exceed to 1.00. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all the covenants contained in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility. 
 
 In connection with the 2024 Amended Credit Facility, we paid lender and third-party fees of million associated with the amendment. We concluded that the amendment resulted in a modification of debt and as such, determined that debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the 2024 Amended Credit Facility would be deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement. Debt issuance costs of million and million are included in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively.

 of our U.S. subsidiaries in Honolulu, Hawaii (the Kunia Well Site ). In 2005, our subsidiary signed a Consent Decree Consent Decree with the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for the performance of the clean-up work for the Kunia Well Site. Based on findings from remedial investigations, our subsidiary coordinated with the EPA to evaluate the clean-up work required in accordance with the Consent Decree. On July 25, 2022, an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for the Kunia Well Site was filed by the EPA, which formally transitioned the remedy for the Kunia Well Site to a Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA), thereby reducing our potential liability. 
 
 The revised estimate associated with the clean-up costs, and on which our accrual is based, is million. As of September 27, 2024, million was included in other noncurrent liabilities, and million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Kunia Well Site clean-up. We expect to expend approximately million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, and million in 2028. 
 
 California Air Resource Board 
 
 On December 21, 2022, the California Air Resource Board ("CARB") issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV") to the Company regarding alleged violations of certain California anti-air pollution regulations by three non-shore capable vessels that were subject to a time charter by us from an unrelated non-U.S. third party. We are cooperating with and assisted CARB in its audits for the alleged violations during 2021. While a formal proceeding by CARB has not been filed, we are discussing a settlement with CARB directly. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we accrued expenses of million as a contingent reserve which are included in asset impairments and other charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This accrual is in addition to a million contingent reserve accrued as of December 29, 2023 related to this matter. 
 
 Legal Settlement 
 
 On May 28, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a litigation matter by a former employee regarding a legacy claim stemming from the 1970s. This matter was in the discovery phase until the first quarter of 2024, when the court set the expected trial date and the parties began to discuss settlement. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2024, we incurred charges of million, net of insurance reimbursements, associated with the settlement which are included in assets impairment and other charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 27, 2024. 
 
 Additional Information 
 
 In addition to the foregoing, we are involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions incident to our operations, both as plaintiff and defendant. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, none of these other claims are currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position or our cash flows.

 Derivative instruments are disclosed on a gross basis. There are various rights of setoff associated with our derivative instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreements. Although various rights of setoff and master netting arrangements or similar agreements may exist with the individual counterparties, individually, these financial rights are not material. 
 
 Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows related to changes in fair value subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. 
 
 Foreign Currency Hedges 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, and we mitigate that exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts. Certain of our subsidiaries periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge portions of forecasted sales or cost of sales denominated in foreign currencies, which generally mature within one year. At September 27, 2024, our foreign currency forward hedge a portion of our 2024 foreign currency exposure. 
 
 The foreign currency forward contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges were designated as single-purpose cash flow hedges of forecasted cash flows.

 Interest Rate Contracts 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates, and we mitigate that exposure by entering into interest rate swaps. During 2018, we entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge the risk of the fluctuation on future interest payments related to our variable rate LIBOR-based borrowings through 2028. We amended our Second A R Credit Agreement and our interest rate swaps to transition from LIBOR to SOFR as a reference rate effective January 3, 2023. 
 
 Gains or losses on interest rate swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings as the interest expense on debt is recognized in earnings. The notional value of the interest rate contract outstanding was million, which was expected to mature in 2028. During the quarter ended September 27, 2024, we agreed to terminate our outstanding interest rate swap in exchange for million in cash proceeds, net of fees of approximately million, which is included in the change in "Other assets and liabilities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 27, 2024. Based on our assessment that the originally hedged cash flows associated with our variable rate borrowings remain probable, the proceeds received as a result of our terminated interest rate swap will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss and be reclassified to earnings through interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged outstanding debt.

 In estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments, we use the following methods and assumptions: 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these items approximates fair value due to their liquid nature and are classified as Level 1. 
 
 Trade accounts receivable and other accounts receivable, net: The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these items is net of allowances, which includes a degree of counterparty non-performance risk and are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Accounts payable and other current liabilities: The carrying value reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these items approximates their fair value, which is the likely amount for which the liability with short settlement periods would be transferred to a market participant with a similar credit standing as ours and are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Long-term debt: The carrying value of our long-term debt reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates their fair value since they bear interest at variable rates which contain an element of default risk. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. Refer to Note 8, Debt and Finance Lease Obligations. 
 
 Fair Value of Non-Financial Assets 
 
 The fair value of the banana reporting unit's goodwill and the prepared food reporting unit's goodwill and remaining trade names and trademarks are highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of these assets. We disclosed the sensitivity related to the banana reporting unit's goodwill and the prepared food reporting unit's goodwill and remaining trade names and trademarks in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. Our current estimates of future cash flows depend on our ability to demonstrate successful implementation of our strategies to improve sales and profitability from these activities over the upcoming quarters. If we are unable to demonstrate successful implementation of these strategies, it could lead to impairment of some or all of these assets. 
 
 Assets held for sale, which had a carrying amount of million as of September 27, 2024, primarily consisted of million related to a distribution facility in North America, million related to certain assets of Fresh Leaf Farms, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mann Packing, and million related to idle farmland in Europe. Assets held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value measurements for our held for sale assets are generally based on Level 3 inputs, which include information obtained from third-party appraisals. On July 2, 2024, we entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale to sell the distribution facility in North America for approximately million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024 subject to any acceleration or postponement as permitted under the agreement.

 On October 26, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to sell certain assets of Fresh Leaf Farms LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company included in our fresh and value-added segment, for approximately plus a variable amount for inventory based on the amount of inventory at closing. Assets to be sold as part of the transaction include our Yuma, Arizona fresh-cut vegetables facility, equipment and remaining inventory as of the date of closing, subject to confirmatory diligence. The sale of these assets is part of our strategic review of our Mann Packing business in order to streamline our operations and concentrate on products that serve a retail customer base. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Hurricane Milton 
 
 On October 9, 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Western Florida resulting in damages to the Company's Port Manatee facility in Manatee County, Florida. Subsequent to landfall, service from the Port Manatee facility was disrupted for approximately two weeks. During this time frame, the Company shifted shipment and fulfillment activities to other port facilities not impacted by Hurricane Milton. The extent of the damage and disruption to our Port Manatee operations, including incremental logistics charges as a result of shifting service to other Company-owned facilities, is being assessed, however the Company does not believe that the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Milton will have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations or our financial condition. The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage on its Port Manatee facility and is currently working with its insurance providers to assess the overall impact from the storms. However, there can be no assurance that insurance proceeds, if any, will fully cover any damage or incremental expenses identified.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
 
 We are one of the world s leading vertically integrated producers, marketers and distributors of high-quality fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, as well as a leading producer and marketer of prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We market our products worldwide under the Del Monte brand, a symbol of product innovation, quality, freshness and reliability since 1892. Our major sales markets are organized as follows: North America, Europe, the Middle East (which includes North Africa) and Asia. Our global sourcing and logistics system allows us to provide regular delivery of consistently high-quality produce and value-added services to our customers. Our major production operations are located in North, Central and South America, Asia and Africa. 
 
 Our business is comprised of three reportable segments, two of which represent our primary businesses of fresh and value-added products and banana, and one that represents our other ancillary businesses. 
 
 Fresh and value-added products - includes pineapples, fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables (which includes fresh-cut salads), melons, vegetables, non-tropical fruit (including grapes, apples, citrus, blueberries, strawberries, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries, and kiwis), other fruit and vegetables, avocados, and prepared foods (including prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, other beverages, and meals and snacks). 
 
 Banana 
 
 Other products and services - includes our third-party freight and logistic services business and our Jordanian poultry and meats business. 
 
 Our vision is to inspire healthy lifestyles through wholesome and convenient products. Our strategy is founded on six goals: 

Current Macroeconomic Environment and Inflation Impact 
 
 Starting in fiscal year 2021, we began experiencing inflationary and cost pressures due to volatility and disruption in the global economy which increased our production and distribution costs due to a multitude of external factors. Specifically, costs of packaging materials, fertilizers, labor, fuel, and ocean and inland freight were significantly impacted, and continued to adversely affect our profitability and operating cash flows during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 In response to these persisting inflationary and cost pressures, we instituted price increases on the majority of our products. Additionally, certain of our contracts for key products include contractually indexed fuel and freight surcharges that vary depending on commodity pricing. We expect that these inflation-justified price increases and surcharges will continue to help mitigate our increased costs. 
 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to further economic disruption and, while we do not operate in Ukraine and our operations in Russia are de minimis, the conflict exacerbated inflationary costs, supply chain and logistical pressures that negatively impacted our business. Similarly, recent shipping disruptions in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways have created logistical pressures that have negatively impacted our business, including impacts to the availability of certain shipping routes resulting in increased shipping times. For example, during the second quarter of 2024, we recorded charges of 0.5 million related to shipments which were disrupted while travelling through the Red Sea. During the third quarter of 2024, we received insurance reimbursements of 0.6 million related to this disruption. While we have taken actions to divert our shipping routes in order to minimize impacts on our business, we may not be able to mitigate the impact of additional write-offs or longer shipping routes on our operations if conditions in the regions surrounding the Red Sea deteriorate. 
 
 Based on the stabilization of inflation in certain key markets during the latter part of 2023, we have not established and do not anticipate further inflation-justified price increases and surcharges in 2024. We are actively monitoring region-specific macroeconomic factors to mitigate increases in our costs, if necessary. 
 
 Optimization Program 
 
 During fiscal 2020, we began a comprehensive review of our asset portfolio, which we continuously update, aimed at identifying non-strategic and underutilized assets to dispose of while reducing costs and driving further efficiencies in our operations (which we refer to as the "2020 Optimization Program"). As a result of the review, we identified assets across all of our regions, primarily consisting of underutilized facilities and land, which we made a strategic decision to sell. During the first three months of 2023, we completed the sales of various assets including two distribution centers and related assets in Saudi Arabia and an idle production facility in North America. Upon the closing of the sale of these assets in the first quarter of 2023, we completed the 2020 Optimization Program. Under the 2020 Optimization Program, we generated cash proceeds of approximately 156.4 million from the sale of non-strategic and underutilized assets. 
 
 Strategic Alternatives for Mann Packing Operation 
 
 During the second half of 2023, we conducted a strategic review and assessed our operational priorities of our North America operations, including our subsidiary, Mann Packing. Preliminary findings of this review were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023. We announced in conjunction with our fourth quarter of 2023 earnings that we were exploring strategic alternatives for the business. After thorough evaluation of potential options, the Company has finalized a number of decisions and begun to take several actions, including the consolidation of a number of Mann Packing operations into a single facility at our Gonzalez facility, which are expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2024. We believe these actions will allow us to streamline operations, reduce overhead costs, and enhance efficiency. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we agreed to sell certain assets of our Fresh Leaf Farms business, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mann Packing, for approximately 16.5 million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In connection with the examination of the tax returns in two foreign jurisdictions, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to transfer pricing aggregating approximately 173.9 million (including interest and penalties) for tax years 2012 through 2016. We strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments and have filed a protest with each of the taxing authorities. 
 
 In one of the foreign jurisdictions, we are currently contesting tax assessments related to the 2012-2015 audit years and the 2016 audit year in both the administrative court and the judicial court. During 2019 and 2020, we filed actions contesting the tax assessment in the administrative office. Our initial challenge to each of these tax assessments was rejected, and we subsequently lost our appeals at the administrative court. We have subsequently filed actions to contest each of these tax assessments in the country s judicial courts. In addition, we have filed a request for injunction to the judicial court to stay the tax authorities' collection efforts for these two tax assessments, pending final judicial decisions. The court granted our injunction with respect to the 2016 audit year, however denied our injunction with respect to the 2012-2015 audit years. We timely appealed the denial of the injunction, and on August 10, 2022 the appellate court overturned the denial and granted our injunction for the 2012-2015 audit years with a trial date set for July 4, 2025. Pursuant to local law, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair market value of 7.0 million in connection with the grant of the 2016 audit year injunction. This real estate collateral has a net book value of 3.8 million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. In addition, in connection with the grant of the 2012-2015 audit year injunction, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair

Table of Contents 

 market value of 29.4 million, and a net book value of 4.6 million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. The registration of this real estate collateral does not affect our operations in the country. 
 
 In the other foreign jurisdiction, the administrative court denied our appeal, and on March 4, 2020 we filed an action in the judicial court to contest the administrative court's decision. The case is still pending. 
 
 We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments and intend to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary in both jurisdictions to resolve the matters, which could be a lengthy process. 
 
 Additionally, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework. Pursuant to the implementation dates prescribed in the Directive, it is expected the rules will be effective for the Company for the 2025 fiscal year. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries, however, we may not be able to completely mitigate the impact of the legislation which could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Quarter ended Nine months ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net sales 1,019.5 1,003.1 3,267.0 3,312.1 Gross profit 93.8 74.4 289.2 288.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 47.9 48.1 148.6 142.6 Operating income 53.9 25.4 166.0 171.9 
 
 Net sales - Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,019.5 million, compared with 1,003.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to higher net sales in the fresh and value-added product segment, driven by higher sales volume and per unit selling prices of avocado and pineapple due to strong market demand. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in banana net sales due to competitive market pressures. 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 was 3,267.0 million, compared with 3,312.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net sales for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower banana net sales due to competitive market pressures. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net sales in the fresh and value-added product segment driven by higher per unit selling prices and sales volume. 
 
 Gross profit - Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 93.8 million, compared with 74.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was impacted by higher sales volume and higher per unit selling prices in the fresh and value-added product segment, partially offset by overall higher per unit production and procurement costs, lower sales volume in our banana segment, and the negative impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily related to the Costa Rican colon. 
 
 Gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 289.2 million compared with 288.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in gross profit for the nine month period was impacted by higher sales volume and per unit selling prices in the fresh and value-added product segment and lower ocean freight costs partially offset by lower net sales in our banana segment, higher per unit production and procurement costs which were partly driven by the negative impact of increased weather-related events including high temperatures and low rainfall in production areas in Central America and the Philippines, and the negative impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily related to the Costa Rican colon.

 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 included 0.6 million of other product-related charges, net, primarily as a result of 1.0 million of additional logistic and inventory write-offs incurred as a result of Hurricane Beryl during July 2024, partially offset by 0.6 million of insurance recoveries related to shipment disruptions in the Red Sea during the second quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, gross profit included other product-related charges, net of 0.8 million, primarily related to the above mentioned charges and 1.2 million of severance charges from the outsourcing of certain functions of our fresh and value-added operations and 0.5 million of expenses recorded related to shipment disruptions in the Red Sea, partially offset by 1.7 million related to insurance recoveries associated with damages tied to the flooding of a seasonal production facility in Greece during the third quarter of 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses - Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 0.2 million when compared with the third quarter of 2023, and increased 6.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the nine month period was primarily due to higher professional fees in North America and higher marketing and promotional activities in Europe, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of definite lived intangible assets due to the impairment of the carrying value of customer relationships and trade name intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and subsidiary - The gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and subsidiary for the third quarter of 2024 of 8.2 million primarily consisted of a 7.7 million gain from the sale of a warehouse in Chile and a 0.3 million gain from the sale of an idle packing facility in Costa Rica. For the first nine months of 2024, gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and subsidiary of 26.6 million also included a 14.7 million gain on the sale of two idle facilities in South America and a 3.4 million gain from the sale of a warehouse in Europe. 
 
 The gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and subsidiary for the third quarter of 2023 of 1.6 million primarily included a gain of 2.4 million related to the sale of a carrier vessel, partially offset by the loss related to the disposals of a farm in the Philippines and a plantation in Costa Rica. For the first nine months of 2023, gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net and subsidiary was 35.8 million and also included a 20.5 million gain on the sale of two distribution centers and related assets in Saudi Arabia, a 7.0 million gain on the sale of an idle production facility in North America and a 3.8 million gain on the sale of our plastics business subsidiary in South America and gains on the sales of land assets in South and Central America. Partially offsetting the net gain was a loss on the disposal of low-yielding banana crops in Central America. 
 
 Asset impairment and other charges, net - Asset impairment and other charges, net of 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 consisted of property, plant and equipment damage due to heavy wind and rainstorms in Chile during the quarter. For the first nine months of 2024, asset impairment and other charges, net of 1.2 million also included charges related to (i) a settlement agreement with respect to a litigation matter by a former employee, net of insurance reimbursements, (ii) a reserve recorded due to a potential liability arising from our third-party logistics operations, and (iii) impairment charges of banana-related fixed assets in the Philippines, partially offset by an insurance reimbursement related to fire damages at a warehouse in South America. 
 
 Asset impairment and other charges, net of 2.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily consisted of impairment charges due to low-yielding banana farms in the Philippines of 3.7 million, property, plant and equipment damage of 0.9 million due to severe flooding caused by heavy rainstorms in Greece, and impairment of right-of-use asset in South America of 0.7 million, partially offset by insurance reimbursement and other credits of 2.8 million in connection with a cybersecurity incident which occurred during early 2023. In addition, the first nine months of 2023 also included impairment charges due to low productivity grape vines in South America, idle land in Central America, and expenses incurred in connection with a cybersecurity incident which occurred during early 2023. 
 
 Operating income - Operating income increased by 28.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the prior-year period. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher gross profit combined with the higher gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Operating income decreased by 5.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the lower gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and subsidiary, partially offset by higher asset impairment and other charges and lower gross profit in the prior year period.

 Interest expense - Interest expense decreased by 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and by 5.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the respective prior-year periods. The decrease during the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower average debt balances. 
 Other (income) expense, net - Other (income) expense, net for the third quarter of 2024 was a gain of 0.1 million compared with a loss of 7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other (income) expense, net for the first nine months of 2024 was a loss of 5.2 million compared with a loss of 22.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in both periods was primarily due to the equity earnings of unconsolidated companies within the food and nutrition sector and lower foreign currency losses as compared to the prior-year periods. 
 
 Income tax provision - Income tax provision increased to 7.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 and increased to 25.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 24.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in both periods is primarily due to increased earnings in certain higher tax jurisdictions partially offset by the prior year tax effects related to the sale of stock of a subsidiary and asset sales in Saudi Arabia and North America.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. is a holding company whose only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own all of our assets. We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, as of September 27, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were (i) cash generated from operations of our subsidiaries, (ii) our combined 806 million of credit facilities, including 750 million associated with our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with an available capacity of approximately 512 million and (iii) existing cash and cash equivalents of 50.8 million. The loan commitments under our credit facilities can be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes. On a long-term basis, we will continue to rely on our credit facilities for any long-term funding not provided by cash generated from operations of our subsidiaries. 
 
 Our principal uses of liquidity are paying the costs associated with our operations, paying dividends, and making capital expenditures to increase our productivity and expand our product offerings and geographic reach.

 A summary of our cash flows is as follows (U.S. dollars in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Summary cash flow information: Net cash provided by operating activities 187.2 180.1 Net cash provided by investing activities 1.0 69.9 Net cash used in financing activities (172.1) (191.2) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 0.9 1.9 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 17.0 60.7 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning 33.8 17.2 Cash and cash equivalents, ending 50.8 77.9 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 187.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with 180.1 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 7.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher net income during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 and (ii) proceeds received during the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the termination of our interest rate swap. The increase was partially offset by the impact of working capital fluctuations, primarily related to larger decreases in inventory and accounts payable in the prior year as a result of a strategic increase in inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 2022 in order to secure costs and availability. 
 
 At September 27, 2024, we had working capital of 609.4 million, compared with 603.7 million at December 29, 2023, an increase of 5.7 million. The increase in working capital was primarily due to (i) an increase in assets held for sale, primarily related to a distribution facility in North America, certain assets of Fresh Leaf Farms business and idle land in Europe which are expected to be sold during the next twelve months and (ii) an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Partially offsetting the increase in working capital was (a) an increase in income taxes and other taxes payable due to increased earnings in certain higher tax jurisdictions in the current period and (b) lower levels in inventory, primarily related to a decrease in growing crop inventory, primarily due to seasonal variations. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.0 million, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of 69.9 million for the first nine months of 2023.

 Partially offsetting the net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 were capital expenditures of 34.1 million which mainly included expenditures related to investments in our operations and production facilities in North America benefiting both our fresh and value-added products and banana segments, including expenditures related to automation and technology initiatives, and improvements to our pineapple operations in Central America and Kenya. Net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 is also offset by 6.2 million in investments in unconsolidated companies in the food and nutrition sector that align with our long-term strategy and vision. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2023 primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and subsidiary of 115.5 million which mainly related to the sales of two distribution centers in Saudi Arabia, an idle production facility in North America, and land assets in South and Central America and proceeds from the sale of our plastic business subsidiary in South America for total purchase consideration of 17.0 million, of which we received 14.0 million.

The transaction was treated as an equity transaction, with the differential between the redeemable noncontrolling interest carrying amount on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the cash purchase price being recognized as an increase in shareholders' equity. 
 
 Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements 
 
 On October 1, 2019, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second A R Credit Agreement with the financial institutions and other lenders named therein, including Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and BofA Securities, Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. The Second A R Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, 0.9 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on October 1, 2024. The Second A R Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on December 30, 2022, to replace the Eurocurrency Rate with the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") effective January 3, 2023. 
 
 On February 21, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2024 Amended Credit Facility") with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and BofA Securities, Inc. as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner and certain other lenders. The 2024 Amended Credit Facility provides for a five-year, 0.75 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 21, 2029. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to the Term SOFR rate plus a margin that ranges from 1.0 to 1.625 based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility). The 2024 Amended Credit Facility also permits, under certain conditions, 200 million of Permitted Receivables Financing (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility). In addition, we pay a fee on unused commitments at a rate equal to 0.150 to 0.250 based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. We intend to use funds borrowed under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility from time to time for general corporate purposes, working capital, capital expenditures and other permitted investment opportunities. 
 
 The 2024 Amended Credit Facility provides for an accordion feature that permits us, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide us with increases in revolving credit facility or term loans up to an aggregate of 300 million Incremental Increases ). The aggregate amount of Incremental Increases can be further increased to the extent that after giving effect to the proposed increase in revolving credit facility commitments or term loans our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on a pro forma basis, would not exceed 2.75 to 1.00. Our ability to request such increases or term loans is subject to our compliance with customary conditions set forth in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with certain financial covenants and ratios. Upon our request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or provide term loans.

 The 2024 Amended Credit Facility contains similar financial covenants to those included within the Second A R Credit Agreement. Specifically, it requires us to maintain 1) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, subject to certain exceptions and 2) minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than 2.25 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Additionally, it requires us to comply with certain other covenants, including limitations on capital investments, the amount of dividends that can be paid in the future, the amounts and types of liens and indebtedness, material asset sales, and mergers. Under the 2024 Amended Credit Facility, we are permitted to declare or pay cash dividends in any fiscal year up to an amount that does not exceed the greater of (i) an amount equal to (1) the greater of (A) 50 of the Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility) for the immediately preceding fiscal year or (B) 25 million (the "Base Dividend Basket") plus (2) commencing in the fiscal year ending December 26, 2025 any portion of the Base Dividend Basket not used in the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (ii) the greatest amount which would not cause the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (determined on a pro forma basis as of the date of declaration or payment) to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. It also provides an allowance for stock repurchases to be an amount not exceeding the greater of (i) (A) 50,000,000 (the "Base Redemption Basket") plus (B) commencing in the fiscal year ending December 26, 2025, any portion of the Base Redemption Basket not used in the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) the greatest amount which would not cause the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (determined on a pro forma basis as of the date of such repurchase) to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all the covenants contained in the 2024 Amended Credit Facility. 
 
 In addition to the indebtedness under our 2024 Amended Credit Facility, our material cash requirements include contractual obligations from other working capital facilities and lease obligations. Refer to Note 8. " Debt and Finance Lease Obligations " of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these material cash requirements. 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 511.7 million unused borrowing capacity, net of letters of credit and guarantees, primarily under the 2024 Amended Credit Facility. 
 
 We believe that our cash on hand, borrowing capacity available under our 2024 Amended Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months. However, we cannot predict whether future developments associated with the current economic environment will materially adversely affect our long-term liquidity position. Our liquidity assumptions, the adequacy of our available funding sources, and our ability to meet our 2024 Amended Credit Facility covenants are dependent on many additional factors, including those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, there were no material changes in our commitments or contractual obligations as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023.

 A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. There were no material changes to these critical accounting policies or estimates during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, and we mitigate that exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts. Certain of our subsidiaries periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge portions of forecasted sales or cost of sales denominated in foreign currencies which generally expire within one year. The fair value of our foreign currency cash flow hedges was a net liability position of 2.2 million as of September 27, 2024 compared to a net liability position of 0.3 million as of December 29, 2023 due to the relative strengthening or weakening of exchange rates when compared to contracted rates. 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates, and we mitigate that exposure by entering into interest rate swaps from time to time. During 2018, we entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge the risk of the fluctuation on future interest payments related to a portion of our variable rate borrowings through 2028. On July 19, 2024, we agreed to terminate our remaining outstanding interest rate swap in exchange for 7.3 million, net of fees of approximately 0.2 million. As a result, as of September 27, 2024, we had no outstanding interest rate swap cash flow

 hedges. The fair value of our interest rate swap cash flow hedges were at an asset position of 7.9 million as of December 29, 2023. The change in value prior to termination of the outstanding interest rate swap was due to the relative decrease in variable interest rates when compared to the rates as of December 29, 2023. Based on our assessment that the originally hedged cash flows associated with our variable rate borrowings remain probable, the proceeds received as a result of our terminated interest rate swap will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss and be reclassified to earnings through interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged debt. 
 
 We enter into derivative instruments with counterparties that are highly rated and do not expect a deterioration of our counterparty s credit ratings; however, the deterioration of our counterparty s credit ratings would affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in the recognition of the fair value of the hedges that would be transferred to earnings as the contracts settle. We expect that 1.2 million of the net fair value of our cash flow hedges recognized as a net gain in accumulated other comprehensive loss, inclusive of amounts received related to our interest rate swap terminated during the third quarter of 2024, will be transferred to earnings during the next 12 months and the remaining net gain of 3.2 million over a period of approximately 4 years, along with the earnings effect of the related forecasted transactions. 
 
 The fair value of the banana reporting unit's goodwill and the prepared food reporting unit's goodwill and remaining trade names and trademarks are highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of these assets. We disclosed the sensitivity related to the banana reporting unit's goodwill and the prepared food reporting unit's goodwill and trade names and trademarks in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023. During the quarter ended September 27, 2024, we did not record impairment charges associated with these reporting units or trade names and trademarks, however we continue to monitor their performance. 
 
 Potential impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. Future changes in the estimates used to conduct our impairment review, including our financial projections and changes in the discount rates used, could cause the analysis to indicate that our goodwill or trade names and trademarks are impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of goodwill or trade names and trademarks. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Refer to Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Interim results are subject to significant variations and may not be indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for an entire fiscal year. Due to seasonal sales price fluctuations, we have historically realized a greater portion of our net sales and gross profit during the first two quarters of the year. The sales price of any fresh produce item fluctuates throughout the year due to the supply of and demand for that particular item, as well as the pricing and availability of other fresh produce items, many of which are seasonal in nature. Information about the seasonality of our results is included under the caption Seasonality provided in Item 1. Business, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Tax related matters 
 
 In connection with the examination of the tax returns in two foreign jurisdictions, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to transfer pricing aggregating approximately 173.9 million (including interest and penalties) for tax years 2012 through 2016. We strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments and have filed a protest with each of the taxing authorities. 
 
 In one of the foreign jurisdictions, we are currently contesting tax assessments related to the 2012-2015 audit years and the 2016 audit year in both the administrative court and the judicial court. During 2019 and 2020, we filed actions contesting the tax assessment in the administrative office. Our initial challenge to each of these tax assessments was rejected, and we subsequently lost our appeals at the administrative court. We have subsequently filed actions to contest each of these tax assessments in the country s judicial courts. In addition, we have filed a request for injunction to the judicial court to stay the tax authorities' collection efforts for these two tax assessments, pending final judicial decisions. The court granted our injunction with respect to the 2016 audit year, however denied our injunction with respect to the 2012-2015 audit years. We timely appealed the denial of the injunction, and on August 10, 2022 the appellate court overturned the denial and granted our injunction for the 2012-2015 audit years with a trial date set for July 4, 2025. Pursuant to local law, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair market value of 7.0 million in connection with the grant of the 2016 audit year injunction. This real estate collateral has a net book value of 3.8 million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. In addition, in connection with the grant of the 2012-2015 audit year injunction, we registered real estate collateral with an approximate fair market value of 29.4 million, and a net book value of 4.6 million as of the quarter ended September 27, 2024. The registration of this real estate collateral does not affect our operations in the country. 
 
 In the other foreign jurisdiction, the administrative court denied our appeal, and on March 4, 2020 we filed an action in the judicial court to contest the administrative court's decision. The case is still pending. 
 
 We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments and intend to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary in both jurisdictions to resolve the matters, which could be a lengthy process. 
 
 California Air Resource Board 
 
 On December 21, 2022, the California Air Resource Board ("CARB") issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV") to the Company regarding violations of certain California anti-air pollution regulations by three non-shore capable vessels that were subject to a time charter by us from an unrelated non-U.S. third party. We are cooperating with and assisted CARB in its audits for the alleged violations during 2021. While a formal proceeding by CARB has not been filed, we are discussing a settlement with CARB directly. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we accrued expenses of 0.5 million as a contingent reserve which are included in asset impairments and other charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This amount is in addition to a 0.4 million contingent reserve accrued as of December 29, 2023 related to this matter. 
 
 For more information, see Note 9. "Commitments and Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
 During the quarter ended September 27, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
