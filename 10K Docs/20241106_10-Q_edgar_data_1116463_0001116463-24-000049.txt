As a result of many factors, including, without limitation, those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Risk Factors section of subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the Company's actual results or timing of certain events could differ materially from the results or timing described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Business Overview 
 The Company's business consists of the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of simple, easy to use diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using the Company's proprietary technologies, as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types. These products include tests for diseases including COVID-19, HIV, Hepatitis C, and Syphilis that are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care, and tests for drugs of abuse that are processed in a laboratory. These products are sold in the United States and internationally to various clinical laboratories, hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations, and other public health organizations, distributors, government agencies, physicians offices, and commercial and industrial entities. The Company's COVID-19 and HIV products are also sold in a consumer-friendly format in the over-the-counter OTC market in the U.S. and, in the case of the HIV product, as a self-test to individuals in a number of other countries, including as an oral swab in-home test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 in Europe. 
 The Company's business also includes molecular sample management solutions and services that are used by clinical laboratories, direct-to-consumer laboratories, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and animal health service and product providers. The revenues from sample management solutions are derived from product sales to commercial customers and sales into the academic and research markets. Customers span the disease risk management, diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotech, companion animal and environmental markets. The Company has also developed collection devices for the emerging microbiome market, which focuses on studying microbiomes and their effect on human and animal health. The Company also has a urine collection device which allows for the volumetric collection of first void urine. This product is in its early stages, and initial sales are occurring primarily through distributors and collaborations in the liquid biopsy and sexually transmitted disease markets. Additionally, through its Diversigen subsidiary, the Company offered laboratory and bioinformatics services for both genomics and microbiome customers. These services were primarily provided to pharmaceutical, biotech companies, and research institutions. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company initiated steps to wind down and exit this line of business. Diversigen contributed 1.7 million to revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and contributed 4.5 million to revenues for the full year of 2023. In October 2024, the Company announced the discontinuance of the sales of its risk assessment product line which is expected to be completed by end of year. Sales of its risk assessment products contributed 6.3 million to revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and contributed 9.7 million to revenues for the full year of 2023.

 Product and Services Revenues 
 Consolidated net revenues decreased 55 to 39.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 89.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales of the Company's Diagnostics products increased 13 to 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in revenues is largely due to higher international HIV revenues of approximately 2.4 million primarily driven by customer ordering patterns of sales in Africa. 
 Molecular Sample Management Solutions revenues decreased 16 to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales of the Company's Molecular Products are being impacted by reduced consumer demand for products in which our genomics collection devices are used, economic pressures, and the overall decline in the microbiome market. 
 COVID-19 Diagnostics revenues decreased by 96 to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 50.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased sales of the Company's InteliSwab tests through its U.S. government procurement contracts. We expect this decline in revenue to continue throughout the remainder of 2024 and for the foreseeable future due to the fulfillment of these contracts and lower overall demand for COVID-19 testing. 
 Risk assessment revenue decreased 25 due to the loss of customers to competing products. The Company has announced that it will discontinue this line of business by the end of 2024. 
 Molecular Services revenues, which are derived from the Company's microbiome molecular sequencing services, decreased 99 to 9 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services revenues was due to the decision to exit this line of business. We expect minimal molecular services revenues in the remainder of 2024.

 Non-Product and Services Revenues 
 Non-product and services revenues increased 52 to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to recognizing royalty income in the third quarter of 2024 and none in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS 
 Consolidated gross profit margin decreased to 42.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 49.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The largest driver of the margin decline was due to the lower volume in InteliSwab sales driven by less units produced and sold and a lower average selling price based on contractual pricing. Furthermore, the lower units produced resulted in lower overhead absorption of fixed costs as compared to the prior year period. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by the increased sales of international product which generate lower margins coupled with the lower margins contributed by genomics products. The decline in gross margins was partially offset by the impact of the exit of the Molecular Services business which historically caused a drag on consolidated gross margin. 
 Consolidated operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.0 million, a decline from the 10.9 million operating income reported for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The operating income reported in the third quarter of 2023 was largely a result of higher revenues and gross margins generated by the Company's InteliSwab product and was partially offset by the inclusion of 6.2 million in impairment loss. In 2023, the Company began implementing cost cutting measures and has benefited from this in the three months ended September 30, 2024 with a 4.2 million reduction in operating expense compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Research and development expenses decreased 34 to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to a decrease in employee costs associated with a reduction in headcount, decrease in spend on COVID-19 product development, and no related project management fees for our 109 million manufacturing expansion contract which ended during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 13 to 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower employee costs associated with a decrease in headcount, decreased bad debt expense and consulting fees and lower amortization expense partially offset by an increase in severance expense due to the third quarter 2024 reduction in workforce. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 2 to 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due lower employee costs due to a reduction in headcount, partially offset by an increase in legal fees and in non-cash stock compensation expense. 
 All of the above contributed to the Company's operating loss of 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which included non-cash charges of 3.0 million for depreciation and amortization, and non-cash charges of 2.9 million for stock-based compensation. The Company's operating income of 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a non-cash impairment charge of 6.2 million, non-cash charges of 3.4 million for depreciation and amortization, and 2.6 million for stock-based compensation. 
 
 OTHER INCOME 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due to higher interest income partially offset by the absence of profit earned under our manufacturing expansion contract with the U.S. government which ended at the end of 2023. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 
 The Company continues to believe the full valuation allowance established against its total U.S. deferred tax asset is appropriate as the facts and circumstances necessitating the allowance have not changed. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded U.S. state income tax expense of 18.0 thousand and 1.1 million, respectively and foreign tax expense of 0.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively.

 Product and Services Revenues 
 Consolidated net product and services revenues decreased 55 to 148.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 329.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales of the Company's Diagnostics products increased 1 to 57.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 56.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher HIV and HCV revenues in international markets of 1.4 million as a result of customer ordering patterns. Also contributing to the diagnostic revenue increase is a combined increase in HCV domestic and Syphilis revenues of 1.4 million. A decline in our HIV domestic revenue resulting from funding delays or reductions in funding for HIV products and customer order patterns partially offset the increased revenues from the other product lines. 
 COVID-19 Diagnostics revenues decreased 80 to 44.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 215.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased sales of the Company's InteliSwab tests through its U.S. government procurement contracts. We expect this decline in revenue to continue for the remainder of 2024 and for the foreseeable future due to the fulfillment of these contracts and lower overall demand for COVID-19 testing. 
 Molecular Sample Management Solutions revenues decreased 12 to 36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales of the Company's Molecular Sample Management Solutions Products are being impacted by reduced consumer demand for products in which our genomics collection devices are used, economic pressures and reduction on funding for programs in which our collection devices are used, and the overall decline in the microbiome market. 
 Risk assessment revenue decreased 17 , due to the loss of customers to competing products. The Company has announced that it will discontinue this line of business by the end of 2024. 
 Molecular Services revenues, which are largely derived from the Company's laboratory services, decreased 53 to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in services revenues was due to the decision to exit this line of business. We expect minimal molecular services revenues in the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Non-Product and Services Revenues 
 Non-product and services revenues decreased 66 to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower funding for research and development activities largely as a result of the end of our agreement with Biomedical Advanced Research Authority ("BARDA") which provided funding to obtain clearance of a premarket notification ("510(k)") and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 waiver of our InteliSwab tests. The Company has communicated to BARDA that it does not intend to pursue further development of this clearance. Further contributing to the decline in non-product revenues is lower royalty income in 2024 as one of the Company's royalty agreements for sample collection kits expired in June 2023. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS 
 Consolidated gross profit margin increased to 44.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 41.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margins in 2023 included 7.0 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the wind-down of InteliSwab manual assembly in Thailand as the Company began to on-shore and automate manufacturing of this product at its Pennsylvania facilities. In addition, reduced salary and benefits due to the reduction in workforce experienced in 2023 and 2024 contributed to improved overhead absorption. Lastly, lower product scrap expense helped to increase margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These improvement in margins were partially offset by the decline in InteliSwab revenues and a shift in product mix of increased revenues from lower margin product. Other non-product revenues which contribute 100 to gross margins also declined for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Consolidated operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.8 million, compared to 28.8 million operating income reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues and were positively impacted by reduced operating expense. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 4.4 million of impairment losses compared to 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the impairment charge, decreased 22.9 to 77.3 million from 100.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflecting the impact of the Company's cost saving measures and headcount reductions. 
 Research and development expenses decreased 25 to 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to lower staffing costs due to a decrease in headcount and no related project management fees for our 109 million manufacturing expansion contract which ended during the fourth quarter of 2023, and a decrease in spend on COVID-19 product development. This overall decrease in spend is partially offset by an increase in severance costs for those employees impacted by the Company's decisions to exit the molecular services business offered by its Diversigen subsidiary and wind-down of operations located in Belgium. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 18 to 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreased employee costs associated with the reduction in headcount and lower advertising, consulting, and amortization expense. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 25 to 33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to lower legal fees relating to the Spectrum litigation (discussed further in Part II. Other Information, Item 1. Legal Proceedings, below) and lower employee costs associated with reduced headcount partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense. 
 All of the above contributed to the Company's operating loss of 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included non-cash impairment charges of 4.4 million, non-cash charges of 8.4 million for depreciation and amortization, and 9.2 million for stock-based compensation. The Company's operating income of 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a non-cash impairment charge of 7.5 million, non-cash charges of 17.4 million for depreciation and amortization, and 7.6 million for stock-based compensation.

 OTHER INCOME 
 Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.3 million compared to 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is largely due to higher interest income offset by absence of profit earned under our manufacturing expansion contract with the U.S. government which ended at the end of 2023. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 
 
 The Company continues to believe the full valuation allowance established against its total U.S. deferred tax asset is appropriate as the facts and circumstances necessitating the allowance have not changed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded U.S. state tax benefit and expense of 0.2 million and 2.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded foreign tax expense and benefit of 1.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively.

 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 278,571 290,407 Working capital 322,367 346,923 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to 278.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 290.4 million at December 31, 2023. 93.7 million or 34 of the 278.6 million in cash and cash equivalents is held by DNAG, the Company's Canadian subsidiary. 
 The Company's working capital decreased to 322.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 346.9 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and working capital was primarily due to the investment in Sapphiros of 30.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Analysis of the Company's Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 27.3 million. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as timing of receipt from customers, inventory purchases, and payments to vendors. The Company's net loss of 8.7 million included non-cash charges of depreciation and amortization expense of 8.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of 9.2 million, impairment losses of 4.4 million, and loss on equity investment of 1.2 million. Cash provided by the working capital accounts included a decrease in accounts receivable of 12.7 million largely associated with lower overall sales and collections of balances due, a decrease in inventory of 8.7 million as the Company fulfilled demand for its InteliSwab product, and a decrease in prepaid expense and other current assets of 2.6 million. Uses of cash included a decrease in accounts payable of 3.4 million due to lower inventory purchases and timing of vendor invoice payments and a decrease in accrued expenses of 7.6 million as the Company paid out year-end bonuses in March 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects proceeds from the maturities of investments of 53.1 million, offset by 53.2 million in purchases of investments. Investing activities also include a 30.0 million investment in Sapphiros, and 3.3 million to acquire property and equipment to support the normal operations of the business. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is largely comprised of 3.5 million used for the repurchase of common stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares awarded to the Company's employees.

 Resources 
 The Company expects existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements over the next twelve months. The Company's cash requirements, however, may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the scope and timing of future strategic acquisitions, the progress of its research and development programs, the scope and results of clinical testing, the cost of any future litigation, the magnitude of capital expenditures, changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners, the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals, the timing and cost of future stock purchases, the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, proprietary rights and any necessary licenses, the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities, market acceptance of new products, competing technological and market developments, the impact of the current economic environment and other factors. 
 A summary of the Company's obligations to make future payments under contracts existing at December 31, 2023 is included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management s opinion, based upon the advice of counsel, the outcomes of such actions are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's future financial position or results of operations. 
 Spectrum Patent Litigation 
 In March 2021, the Company filed a complaint against Spectrum Solutions, LLC ("Spectrum") in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain saliva collection devices manufactured and sold by Spectrum infringe a patent held by DNAG. Spectrum filed an answer asserting that its device does not infringe the Company's patent and that the Company's patent is invalid. In August 2021, the Company amended its complaint to add a second patent to this litigation. Spectrum responded to the Company's amended complaint and asserted counterclaims for inequitable conduct and antitrust violations with respect to one of the patents in the litigation and subsequently filed a request for review of the second patent at the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"), which was granted by the PTO. The District Court issued multiple pretrial orders, resolving the infringement, antitrust, and inequitable conduct claims without trial. First, the District Court granted Spectrum s motion for summary judgment of noninfringement. The Company appealed the grant of summary judgment to the Court of Appeals on June 8, 2023. The Company is pursuing the appeal with respect to the first patent, with oral argument expected in the first quarter of 2025. Second, the Court denied Spectrum s motion to supplement its allegations of alleged antitrust violations, finding that if such an amendment were allowed, Spectrum s claims would not survive a motion for summary judgment. Spectrum thereafter withdrew its antitrust and inequitable conduct counterclaims. Spectrum did not appeal the District Court's denial of its motion to amend. On February 7, 2024, the PTO issued a Final Written Decision regarding the second patent in the litigation, holding that claims 1, 3-8, 11 and 12 of U.S. Patent No. 11,002,646 B2 are unpatentable. On March 8, 2024, the Company filed a Request for Rehearing by the Director of the PTO of the Final Written Decision. On March 27, 2024, the Company's Request for Rehearing was denied. On September 15, 2023, Spectrum filed a separate petition for inter partes review of a third patent, which DNAG did not assert in the District Court. On March 26, 2024, the PTO issued a Decision Granting Institution of Inter Partes Review and scheduled oral argument for January 13 2025. On July 2, 2024, the Company filed a Motion to Amend the claims of the third patent, which remains pending.
