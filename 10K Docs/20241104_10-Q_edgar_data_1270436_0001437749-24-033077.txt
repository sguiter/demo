Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

You should consider the areas of risk and uncertainty described above and discussed under Item 1A Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual results may differ materially because of various factors, some of which are outside our control, including the following: 

a decline in general economic conditions or the global financial markets;

The Company operates its capital markets activities primarily through its subsidiaries: JVB in the United States and CCFESA in Europe. A division of JVB, Cohen Company Capital Markets ("CCM") is the Company's full-service boutique investment bank, which focuses on M A, underwriting, capital markets and SPAC advisory services. 
 
 Asset Management : The Company s Asset Management business segment manages assets within CDOs, managed accounts, joint ventures, and investment funds (collectively referred to as Investment Vehicles ). A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes backed by the assets. In the event of default, the lenders will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. The Company s Asset Management business segment includes its fee-based asset management operations, which include ongoing base and incentive management fees. 
 
 Principal Investing : The Company s Principal Investing business segment is comprised of investments that the Company holds related to its SPAC franchise and other investments the Company has made for the purpose of earning an investment return rather than investments made to support the Company s trading and other Capital Markets business segment activities. In addition, the Company has received financial instruments as consideration for advisory services provided by its Capital Markets business segment, which are included in this segment. These investments are included in the Company s other investments, at fair value; other investments sold, not yet purchased; and investments in equity method affiliates in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company generates its revenue by business segment primarily through the following activities. 
 
 Capital Markets 
 
 Trading activities of the Company, which include execution and brokerage services, riskless trading activities as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities and derivatives classified as trading; 
 Revenue earned on the Company s gestation repo financing program; and 
 New issue and advisory revenue comprised of (a) origination fees for newly created financial instruments originated by the Company, (b) revenue from advisory services, (c) underwriting, and (d) revenue associated with arranging and placing the issuance of newly created financial instruments. 

Asset Management 
 
 Asset management fees for the Company s on-going asset management services provided to certain Investment Vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities in the Investment Vehicle, and incentive management fees earned based on the performance of the various Investment Vehicles. 

Principal Investing 
 
 Gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as other investments at fair value and other investments sold, not yet purchased; and 
 Income and loss earned on equity method investments. 

and , respectively. The estim ated f air value measurements of the debt are generally based on discounted cash flow models prepared by the Company s management primarily using discount rates for similar instruments issued to companies with similar credit risks to the Company and are generally classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Derivatives : These amounts are carried at fair value. Derivatives may be included as a component of investments-trading; trading securities sold, not yet purchased; other investments, at fair value; and other investments, sold not yet purchased. The fair value is generally based on quoted market prices on an exchange that is deemed to be active for derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts and Eurodollar futures. For derivative instruments, such as TBAs and other extended settlement trades, the fair value is generally based on market price quotations from third party pricing services. 

in the Operating LLC (the JKD Investment ), of which was invested upon the execution of the JKD Investment Agreement, an additional was invested in January 2017, and an additional was invested in January 2019. The JKD Investor is owned by Jack J. DiMaio, the vice chairman of the board of directors, and his spouse. The Company recorded the JKD Investment as a redeemable financial instrument on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In exchange for the JKD Investment, the Operating LLC agreed to pay to JKD Investor during the term of the JKD Investment Agreement an amount JKD Investment Return equal to 50 of the difference between (i) the revenues generated during a quarter by the activities of the Institutional Corporate Trading Business of JVB (as defined in the JKD Investment Agreement) and (ii) certain expenses incurred by such Institutional Corporate Trading Business (the Institutional Corporate Trading Business Net Revenue ). This JKD Investment Return was recorded monthly as interest expense or (interest income) with the related accrued interest recorded in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. If the return was negative in an individual quarter, it would reduce the balance of the JKD Investment. Payments on the JKD Investment Return were made on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Pursuant to the JKD Investment Agreement, upon the termination of the JKD Investment Agreement, the Operating LLC would pay to the JKD Investor an amount equal to the Investment Balance (as is defined in the JKD Investment Agreement) as of the day prior to such termination. 
 
 Effective September 1, 2024 the Operating LLC and the JKD Investor entered into a Redemption Agreement (the Redemption Agreement ), pursuant to which, the JKD Investment Agreement was redeemed and terminated in its entirety. As of September 1, 2024, the JKD Investment balance under the JKD Investment Agreement was . 
 
 Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Redemption Agreement, the Operating LLC (i) paid to JKD Investor of the outstanding amount in cash; and (ii) the Company issued to JKD Investor a senior promissory note (the 2024 Note in the aggregate principal amount of representing the remaining balance of the JKD Investment. See note 15. 
 
 2024 Note 
 
 Effective September1, 2024, as is noted immediately above, the Company issued to JKD Investor the 2024 Note pursuant to the Redemption Agreement. The 2024 Note evidences the Operating LLC s obligation to repay to the JKD Investor the original principal amount of . Pursuant to the 2024 Note, the unpaid principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable as follows: (i) of the principal amount will be due and payable on August 31, 2025, and (ii) will be due and payable on August 31, 2026. 
 
 The 2024 Note accrues interest on the unpaid principal amount from September 1, 2024 until maturity at a rate equal to per year. Interest on the 2024 Note is payable in cash quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, commencing on October 1, 2024. Under the 2024 Note, upon the occurrence or existence of any Event of Default thereunder, the outstanding principal amount is (or in certain instances, at the option of the holder thereof, may be) immediately accelerated. Further, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under the 2024 Note and for so long as such Event of Default continues, all principal, interest and other amounts payable under the 2024 Note will bear interest at a rate equal to per year. 
 
 The 2024 Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to January 31, 2025. The 2024 Note may, with at least 31 days prior written notice from the Operating LLC to the holder of the 2024 Note, be prepaid in whole or in part at any time following January 31, 2025 without the prior written consent of the holder of the 2024 Note and without penalty or premium. See note 16. 
 
 Consolidation of the SPAC Fund 
 
 Prior to March 31, 2023, the general partner of the SPAC Fund Vellar GP had an investment in the SPAC Fund, the potential to earn incentive fees, and did not consolidate the SPAC Fund. Effective April 1, 2023, all of the investors in the SPAC Fund, other than Vellar GP, redeemed all of their interests in the SPAC Fund. Therefore, effective April 1, 2023, Vellar GP became the sole owner of the SPAC Fund and began consolidating it. The Company owns an interest in and consolidates Vellar GP. Effective April 1, 2023, the Company began consolidating the SPAC Fund as well. The Company recorded the following entry upon consolidation.

 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three -level valuation hierarchy. The valuation hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). The three levels of the valuation hierarchy under FASB ASC 820 are described below. 
 
 Level 1 Financial assets and liabilities with values that are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities with values that are based on one or more of the following: 
 
 1. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 2. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; 
 3. Pricing models with inputs that are derived, other than quoted prices, and observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or 
 4. Pricing models with inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities with values that are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the valuation hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the valuation hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 
 Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category that may be presented in the tables below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities) inputs. 

The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and indicate the valuation hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.

1 As a practical expedient, the Company uses NAV (or its equivalent) to measure the fair value of its investments in the U.S. Insurance JV and the CREO JV. The U.S. Insurance JV invests in USD denominated debt issued by small insurance and reinsurance companies. The CREO JV invests primarily in multi-family commercial real estate mortgage-backed loans. According to ASC 820, these investments are not categorized within the valuation hierarchy. 

The following provides a brief description of the types of financial instruments the Company holds, the methodology for estimating fair value, and the level within the valuation hierarchy of the estimate. The discussion that follows applies regardless of whether the instrument is included in investments-trading; other investments, at fair value; other investments sold, not yet purchased; or trading securities sold, not yet purchased. 
 
 CLOs and CDOs : CLOs and CDOs are interests in securitizations. When the Company is able to obtain independent market quotations from at least two broker-dealers and where a price within the range of at least two broker-dealers is used or market price quotations from third party pricing services is used, these interests in securitizations will generally be classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. These valuations are based on a market approach. The independent market quotations from broker-dealers are generally nonbinding. The Company seeks quotations from broker-dealers that historically have actively traded, monitored, issued, and been knowledgeable about the interests in securitizations. The Company generally believes to the extent that it (i) receives two quotations in a similar range from broker-dealers knowledgeable about these interests in securitizations and (ii) considers the broker-dealers gather and utilize observable market information such as new issue activity in the primary market, trading activity in the secondary market, credit spreads versus historical levels, bid-ask spreads, and price consensus among market participants and sources, then classification within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy is appropriate. In the absence of two broker-dealer market quotations, a single broker-dealer market quotation may be used without corroboration of the quote, in which case the Company generally classifies the fair value within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 If quotations are unavailable, prices observed by the Company for recently executed market transactions or valuation models prepared by the Company s management may be used, which are based on an income approach. These models prepared by the Company s management include estimates, and the valuations derived from them could differ materially from amounts realizable in an open market exchange. Each CLO and CDO position is evaluated independently taking into consideration available comparable market levels, underlying collateral performance and pricing, deal structures, and liquidity. Fair values based on internal valuation models prepared by the Company s management are generally classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Establishing fair value is inherently subjective (given the volatile and sometimes illiquid markets for certain interests in securitizations) and requires management to make a number of assumptions, including assumptions about the future of interest rates, discount rates, and the timing of cash flows. The assumptions the Company applies are specific to each security. Although the Company may rely on internal calculations to compute the fair value of certain interests in securitizations, the Company requests and considers indications of fair value from third party pricing services to assist in the valuation process. 
 
 Certificates of Deposit : The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated using valuations provided by third party pricing services. The Company classifies the fair value of certificates of deposit within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Corporate Bonds and Redeemable Preferred Stock : The Company uses recently executed transactions or third -party quotations from independent pricing services to arrive at the fair value of its investments in corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stock. These valuations are based on a market approach. The Company generally classifies the fair value of these bonds within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In instances where the fair values of securities are based on quoted prices in active markets (for example with redeemable preferred stock), the Company classifies the fair value of these securities within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Equity Securities : The fair value of equity securities that represent unrestricted investments in publicly traded companies (common or preferred shares, options, warrants, and other equity investments) is determined using the closing price of the security as of the reporting date. These are securities that are traded on a recognized liquid exchange and the Company classifies their fair value within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair value of equity securities that represent investments in privately held companies is generally determined either (i) based on a valuation model or (ii) based on recently observed transactions in the same instrument or similar instrument that the Company holds. These valuations are generally classified within either level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Value : From time to time, the Company invests in equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value that also do not qualify for equity method accounting or the practical expedient for investments in investment companies, which are measured at NAV. In those cases, the Company utilizes the measurement alternative of ASC 321 - 10 - 35 - 2. This alternative allows the Company to carry the investment at cost minus impairment. If the Company observes a market transaction for an identical or similar instrument, it will adjust the carrying value of the equity security. These securities are included as a component of other investments, at fair value. When measured at fair value using an orderly observable market transaction, it will generally be classified as level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Otherwise, it will be classified as level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Restricted Equity Securities : Restricted equity securities are investments in publicly traded companies. However, they are restricted from re-sale until either (a) the share price trades above a certain threshold for a certain period of time or (b) a certain period of time elapses, or both. The Company determines the fair value by utilizing a model that starts with the publicly traded share price but then applies a discount based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The inputs to this model are observable so the Company generally classifies these securities within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. If the restriction is short and deemed immaterial, the Company will determine fair value to be equal to the publicly traded share price without discount and will classify the securities within level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company is not allowed to sell these shares during the restriction period and there is no certainty as to when these hurdles will be met or if they will be met at all. 
 
 Fair value receivables : Fair value receivables represent amounts receivable from third parties in connection with the Company's SFAs and CCM business. See note 9. The Company values these instruments using a model. The main input to these models is the risk-based cash flow discount rates. In the case where the receivable is convertible into counterparty equity, additional inputs include the counterparty s share price, volatility, and the risk-free rate of return. The inputs to this model are observable so the Company classifies these securities within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Foreign Government Bonds : The fair value of foreign government bonds is estimated using valuations provided by third party pricing services and classifies the fair value within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Interests in SPVs : The Company values these instruments using a model. The model first determines the value of the SPV's financial instruments and then determines what portion of that fair value is allocable to the Company s interest in the SPV. If appropriate, the Company determines the fair value of the financial instruments held by the SPV using a model, which may include a Monte Carlo simulation. The main inputs are the counterparty s share price, volatility, risk-free rate of return, and risk-based cash flow discount rates. The inputs to this model are observable so the Company classifies these securities within level 2 of the hierarchy. 
 
 Municipal Bonds : Municipal bonds, which include obligations of U.S. states, municipalities, and political subdivisions, primarily include bonds or notes issued by U.S. municipalities. The Company generally values these securities using third party quotations such as market price quotations from third party pricing services. The Company generally classifies the fair value of these bonds within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The valuations are based on a market approach. In instances where the Company is unable to obtain reliable market price quotations from third party pricing services, the Company will use its own internal valuation models. In these cases, the Company will classify such securities as level 3 within the valuation hierarchy until it is able to obtain third party pricing. 

Residential Mortgage Loans : The Company generally values these loans using a model. The model s main inputs are current market quotations for pooled mortgage loan securities with similar characteristics. The Company considers the inputs to be observable and, therefore, classifies the fair value of these loans within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 RMBS : The Company generally values these securities using third party quotations such as unadjusted broker-dealer quoted prices or market price quotations from third party pricing services. These valuations are based on a market approach. The Company generally classifies the fair value of these securities based on third party quotations within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 SBA Loans : SBA loans include loans and SBA interest only strips. In the case of loans, the Company generally values these securities using third party quotations such as unadjusted broker-dealer quoted prices, internal valuation models using observable inputs, or market price quotations from third party pricing services. The Company generally classifies these investments within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. These valuations are based on a market approach. SBA interest only strips do not trade in an active market with readily available prices. Accordingly, the Company generally uses valuation models to determine fair value and classifies the fair value of the SBA interest only strips within level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy depending on whether the model inputs are observable or not. 
 
 U.S. Government Agency Debt Securities : Callable and non-callable U.S. government agency debt securities are measured primarily based on quoted market prices obtained from third party pricing services. Non-callable U.S. government agency debt securities are generally classified within level 1 and callable U.S. government agency debt securities are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 U.S. Government Agency MBS and CMOs : These are securities that are generally traded over the counter. The Company generally values these securities using third party quotations such as unadjusted broker-dealer quoted prices or market price quotations from third party pricing services. These valuations are based on a market approach. The Company classifies the fair value of these securities within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 U.S. Treasury Securities : U.S. Treasury securities include U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, and the fair values of the U.S. Treasury securities are based on quoted prices or market activity in active markets. Valuation adjustments are not applied. The Company classifies the fair value of these securities within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 TBAs and Other Forward Agency MBS Contracts 
 
 The Company generally values these securities using third party quotations such as unadjusted broker-dealer quoted prices or market price quotations from third party pricing services. TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts are generally classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. If there is limited transaction activity or less transparency to observe market-based inputs to valuation models, TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. government agency MBS and CMOs include TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts. Unrealized gains on TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts are included in investments-trading on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and unrealized losses on TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts are included in trading securities sold, not yet purchased on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. See note 9. 
 
 Other Extended Settlement Trades 
 
 When the Company buys or sells a financial instrument that will not be settled in the regular timeframe, the Company will account for that purchase or sale on the settlement date rather than the trade date. In those cases, the Company accounts for the transaction between trade date and settlement date as a derivative (as either a purchase commitment or sale commitment). The Company will record an unrealized gain or unrealized loss on the derivative for the difference between the fair value of the underlying financial instrument as of the reporting date and the agreed upon transaction price. The Company will determine the fair value of the financial instrument using the methodologies described above. 
 
 Equity Derivatives 
 
 The Company may enter into equity derivatives, which include listed options as well as other derivative transactions with an underlying equity instrument. Listed options are traded on a recognized liquid exchange and the Company classifies the fair value of these securities within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Other equity derivatives (where the underlying equity instrument is publicly traded but the derivative itself is not are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 
 Foreign currency forward contracts are exchange-traded derivatives, which transact on an exchange that is deemed to be active. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on current quoted market prices. Valuation adjustments are not applied. These are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. See note 9. 
 
 Share forward liabilities 
 
 Share forward liabilities are included as a component of other investments sold, not yet purchased in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company considers these derivatives as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. See note 9.

 In addition, the Company may engage in advisory transactions that result in a receivable that can be paid in cash or a variable number of equity instruments. In such instances, the Company would record the receivable as a component of other assets in its consolidated balance sheets and record the equity component as an embedded derivative. All equity derivatives are carried at fair value as a component of other investments, at fair value or other investments sold, not yet purchased in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had equity derivatives included in other investments, at fair value of and , respectively. 
 
 The Company may hedge a portion of the exposure from these equity investments by entering into short trades. These short trades are not treated as derivatives and are carried as a component of other investments sold, not yet purchased in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. See note 7. 
 
 TBAs and Other Forward Agency MBS Contracts 
 
 TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell MBS with collateral that remains to be announced until just prior to the trade settlement date. In addition to TBAs, the Company sometimes enters into forward purchases or sales of agency MBS where the underlying collateral has been identified. These transactions are referred to as other forward agency MBS contracts. TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts are accounted for as derivatives by the Company under ASC 815. The settlement of these transactions is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In addition to TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts as part of the Company s broker-dealer operations, the Company may, from time to time, enter into other securities or loan trades that do not settle within the normal securities settlement period. In those cases, the purchase or sale of the security or loan is not recorded until the settlement date. However, from the trade date until the settlement date, the Company s interest in the security is accounted for as a derivative as either a forward purchase commitment or forward sale commitment. The Company will classify the related derivative either within investments-trading or other investments, at fair value, depending on where it intends to classify the investment once the trade settles. 
 
 The Company enters into TBAs and other forward agency MBS transactions for three main reasons. 
 
 (i) The Company trades U.S. government agency obligations. In connection with these activities, the Company may be required to maintain inventory in order to facilitate customer transactions. In order to mitigate exposure to market risk, the Company may enter into the purchase and sale of TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts. 
 (ii) The Company also enters into TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts in order to assist clients (generally small to mid-size mortgage loan originators) in hedging the interest rate risk associated with the mortgages owned by these clients. 
 (iii) Finally, the Company may enter into TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts on a speculative basis. 

The Company carries TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts at fair value and includes them as a component of investments-trading or trading securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had open TBAs and other forward MBS purchase agreements in the notional amount of and open TBAs and other forward MBS sale agreements in the notional amount of . At December 31, 2023 , the Company had open TBAs and other forward agency MBS purchase agreements in the notional amount of and open TBAs and other forward agency MBS sale agreements in the notional amount of . 

Other Extended Settlement Trades 
 
 When the Company buys or sells a financial instrument that will not be settled in the regular timeframe, the Company will account for that purchase or sale on the settlement date rather than the trade date. In those cases, the Company accounts for the transaction between trade date and settlement date as either a forward purchase commitment or a forward sale commitment, which are both considered derivatives. The Company will record an unrealized gain or unrealized loss on the derivative for the difference between the fair value of the underlying financial instrument as of the reporting date and the agreed upon transaction price. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had open forward purchase or sales commitments. 
 
 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 
 The Company invests in foreign currency denominated investments that expose it to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, and, therefore, the Company may, from time to time, hedge such exposure by using foreign currency forward contracts. The Company carries foreign currency forward contracts at fair value and includes them as a component of other investments, at fair value in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.

SFAs 
 
 The Company has engaged in several transactions known as SFAs. In a typical SFA transaction, the Company acquires an interest in a publicly traded company (referred to as the "SFA Counterparty") through open-market purchases, direct acquisitions from the SFA Counterparty, or a combination thereof. These interests can take the form of unrestricted common shares, restricted common shares, equity derivatives, or fair value receivables. 
 
 Upon acquiring these interests, the Company enters into an SFA derivative arrangement with the SFA Counterparty. In cases where the Company acquires its interests in the SFA Counterparty through open-market purchases, the SFA generally requires an up-front payment to the Company from the SFA Counterparty. The amount of this payment equals the cost paid by the Company for those interests, less a shortfall amount in certain cases. To fund the shortfall portion of the initial investment, the Company will utilize available cash on hand or available financing. 
 
 The SFA stipulates that the Company must make a payment to the SFA Counterparty on a certain maturity date. Depending on the terms of the SFA, this payment may be made in cash, by returning the acquired interests in kind, or through a combination of both. In some cases, the SFA requires the payment to be made exclusively in cash. 
 
 Importantly, the SFA does not obligate the Company to hold the interests that it acquired in the SFA Counterparty. Following the execution of the SFA, the Company is free to sell the interests in the SFA Counterparty (assuming the interests themselves are not restricted from transfer). Additionally, SFAs generally include a feature whereby if the Company holds the interests in the SFA Counterparty that it acquired until maturity or another agreed-upon date, the Company becomes eligible to receive an additional payment from the SFA Counterparty, either in cash or in additional interests in the SFA Counterparty. Such a payment is known as the "Maturity Consideration." 
 
 Furthermore, SFAs usually include a provision allowing the Company to terminate the SFA, either in whole or in part, before its maturity by making an agreed-upon payment based on an amount defined in the SFA (the Reset Price ). The Reset Price may either remain fixed throughout the term of the SFA or fluctuate based on certain calculations within the SFA. 
 
 SFAs also impose various obligations on the SFA Counterparty that may include registering a predetermined number of the interests in the SFA Counterparty (subject to the SFA) with the SEC, maintaining a listing of the SFA Counterparty securities on a national exchange, and/or that the closing price of the SFA Counterparty's shares on the public exchange does not fall below a predetermined price for a specific period of time. If any of these SFA Counterparty obligations are breached or not satisfied, the Company may have the right to terminate the SFA early and accelerate the payment of the Maturity Consideration upon termination. The SFAs provide the right of set off in the case of Maturity Consideration thereby allowing the Company to keep the interests it holds in the SFA Counterparty and offset the Maturity Consideration it is owed following termination of the applicable SFA. 
 
 The Company accounts for SFA transactions as follows: 
 
 The interests in public companies that it owns are carried at fair value. Refer to note 8 for further details on determining the fair value of unrestricted common shares, restricted common shares, equity derivatives, or fair value receivables. 
 The derivative obligation arising from the SFA is also carried at fair value. Fair value represents the amount the Company would need to pay to settle the SFA obligation at any reporting period date. If the SFA allows the Company multiple methods of settling the obligation, the Company will choose the most advantageous one to value the derivative obligation. In performing this calculation, only settlement methods contractually available to the Company at the reporting date will be considered (i.e., ones available at some future date will not be considered). For instance, if the Company may early terminate the SFA by either returning common shares or making a cash payment based on the Reset Price, the liability will be valued at the lower of: (i) the fair value of the common shares and (ii) the cash amount based on the Reset Price. 
 The Company does not recognize any Maturity Consideration as revenue until it is earned under the contract, either by meeting the hold period requirement or due to a breach of obligation by the SFA Counterparty that enables the Company to terminate the SFA early. 
 In cases where the Company earns Maturity Consideration and the amount it is owed exceeds the fair value of the interest it owns that is available to offset, the Company will consider the probability of payment of the remaining Maturity Consideration based on the credit quality of the SFA Counterparty and general market conditions. If the Company determines the collection of the remaining Maturity Consideration owed is not probable, the Company will not record the unpaid portion. 

The following table shows the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of SFA transactions as of the reporting period dates.

. Effective June 30, 2022, FGMC filed for bankruptcy. Subsequent to June 30, 2022, the Company issued a default notice to FGMC under the reverse repo. The Company took possession of the collateral and began liquidating it. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had liquidated all of the collateral with the exception of and , respectively, of residential mortgage loans. These loans were carried at fair value and were included in investments-trading in the consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded a gain of and a loss of ), respectively, which are included as a component of net trading revenue and are related to the change in the fair value of the remaining collateral. 
 
 Other Repo Transactions 
 
 In addition to the Company s gestation repo business, the Company may also enter into reverse repos to acquire securities to cover short positions or as an investment. Additionally, the Company may enter into repos to finance the Company s securities positions held in inventory. These repo and reverse repo agreements are generally cleared on a bilateral or triparty basis; no clearing broker is involved. 
 
 Repo Information 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company held reverse repos of and , respectively, and the fair value of collateral received under reverse repos was and , respectively.

 Concentration 
 
 In the gestation repo business, the demand for borrowed funds is generated by the reverse repo counterparty and the supply of funds is provided by the repo counterparty. 

The gestation repo business has been and continues to be concentrated with respect to reverse repurchase counterparties. The Company conducts this business with a limited number of reverse repo counterparties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company s gestation reverse repos shown in the tables below represented balances from and counterparties, respectively. The Company also has a limited number of repo counterparties in the gestation repo business. However, this is primarily a function of the limited number of reverse repo agreement counterparties with whom the Company conducts this business rather than a reflection of a limited supply of funds. Therefore, the Company considers the gestation repo business to be concentrated on the demand side. 
 
 The total net revenue earned by the Company on its gestation repo business (net interest margin and fee revenue) was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The total net revenue earned by the Company on its gestation repo business was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively.

 Investment in consolidated VIEs 

The maximum potential loss the Company could incur related to the consolidated VIEs is the investment in consolidated VIEs shown in the table above, plus the Company has to fund additional working capital to the equity method investees of certain of the consolidated VIEs. 
 
 The Company s Principal Investing Portfolio 
 
 Included in other investments, at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, are investments in several VIEs. In each case, the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary. The maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if the VIEs were to default on all their obligations would be the loss of the carrying value of these investments as well as any future investments the Company were to make. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were and , respectively, of unfunded commitments to VIEs in which the Company had invested. Other than its investment in these entities, the Company did not provide financial support to these VIEs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and had liabilities, contingent liabilities, or guarantees (implicit or explicit) related to these VIEs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . See the table below. 
 
 For each investment management contract entered into by the Company, the Company assesses whether the entity being managed is a VIE and if the Company is the primary beneficiary. Certain of the Investment Vehicles managed by the Company are VIEs. Under the current guidance of ASU 2015 - 12, the Company has concluded that its asset management contracts are not variable interests. Currently, the Company has no other interests in the entities it manages that are considered variable interests and are considered significant. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs that it manages. 
 
 The Company s Trading Portfolio 
 
 From time to time, the Company may acquire an interest in a VIE through the investments it makes as part of its trading operations, which are included as investments-trading or securities sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to the high volume of trading activity in which the Company engages, the Company does not perform a formal assessment of each individual investment within its trading portfolio to determine if the investee is a VIE and if the Company is a primary beneficiary. Even if the Company were to obtain a variable interest in a VIE through its trading portfolio, the Company would not be deemed to be the primary beneficiary for two main reasons: (a) the Company does not usually obtain the power to direct activities that most significantly impact any investee s financial performance and (b) a scope exception exists within the consolidation guidance for cases where the reporting entity is a broker-dealer and any control (either as the primary beneficiary of a VIE or through a controlling interest in a voting interest entity) was deemed to be temporary. In the unlikely case that the Company obtained the power to direct activities and obtained a significant variable interest in an investee in its trading portfolio that was a VIE, any such control would be deemed to be temporary due to the rapid turnover of the Company s trading portfolio. 
 
 The following table presents the carrying amounts of the assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheets related to the Company s variable interests in identified VIEs with the exception of (i) the two trust VIEs that hold the Company s junior subordinated notes (see note 16 and (ii) any security that represents an interest in a VIE that is included in investments-trading or securities sold, not yet purchased in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The table below shows the Company s maximum exposure to loss associated with these identified nonconsolidated VIEs in which it holds variable interests at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

However, the Company owns the common stock of the trusts in a total par amount of 1,489. The Company pays interest (and at maturity, principal) to the trusts on the entire junior notes outstanding. However, the Company receives back from the trusts the pro rata share of interest and principal on the common stock held by the Company. These trusts are VIEs and the Company does not consolidate them even though the Company holds the common stock. The Company carries the common stock on its balance sheet at a value of 0.

The 2024 Note 
 
 On September 1, 2024, pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, the Operating LLC issued to JKD Investor the 2024 Note, which evidences the Operating LLC s obligation to repay to the JKD Investor the original principal amount of . Pursuant to the 2024 Note, the unpaid principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable as follows: (i) of the principal amount will be due and payable on August 31, 2025, and (ii) will be due and payable on August 31, 2026. 
 
 The 2024 Note accrues interest on the unpaid principal amount from September 1, 2024 until maturity at a rate equal to per year. Interest on the 2024 Note is payable in cash quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, commencing on October 1, 2024. Under the 2024 Note, upon the occurrence or existence of any Event of Default thereunder, the outstanding principal amount is (or in certain instances, at the option of the holder thereof, may be) immediately accelerated. Further, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under the 2024 Note and for so long as such Event of Default continues, all principal, interest and other amounts payable under the 2024 Note will bear interest at a rate equal to per year. 
 
 The 2024 Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to January 31, 2025. The 2024 Note may, with at least 31 days prior written notice from the Operating LLC to the holder thereof, be prepaid in whole or in part at any time following January 31, 2025 without the prior written consent of the holder and without penalty or premium. 
 
 The 2024 Note and the payment of all principal, interest and any other amounts payable thereunder are senior obligations of the Operating LLC and will be senior to any Indebtedness (as defined in the 2024 Note) of the Operating LLC outstanding as of and issued following September 1, 2024. Pursuant to the 2024 Note, following September 1, 2024, the Operating LLC may not incur any Indebtedness that is a senior obligation to the 2024 Note. See notes 4 and 15. 
 
 The 2020 Note 
 
 On January 5, 2024, the Operating LLC and JKD Investor entered into an amendment to the 2020 Note, pursuant to which the 2020 Note was amended to (a) extend (i) the maturity date thereof from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2026, ii) the date following which the 2020 Note may be redeemed by JKD Investor from January 31, 2023 to January 31, 2025, and (iii) the date following which the 2020 Note may be prepaid by the Operating LLC from January 31, 2023 to January 31, 2025; and (b) increase the interest rate payable under the 2020 Note from per annum to per annum effective as of January 31, 2024. 

Junior Subordinated Notes 
 
 The Company assumed aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated notes outstanding at the time of the AFN Merger. The Company recorded the debt at fair value on the acquisition date. Any difference between the fair value of the junior subordinated notes on the AFN Merger date and the principal amount of debt is amortized into earnings over the estimated remaining life of the underlying debt as an adjustment to interest expense. 
 
 The junior subordinated notes are payable to two special purpose trusts:

Sunset Financial Trust simultaneously issued shares of Sunset Financial Trust s common securities to the Company for a purchase price of , which constitutes all of the issued and outstanding common securities of Sunset Financial Trust. 

Alesco Capital Trust I and Sunset Financial Trust (collectively, the Trusts described above are VIEs pursuant to variable interest provisions included in ASC 810 because the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have adequate decision making ability over the Trusts activities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts as it does not have the power to direct the activities of the Trusts. The Trusts are not consolidated by the Company and, therefore, the Company s consolidated financial statements include the junior subordinated notes issued to the Trusts as a liability, and the investment in the Trusts common securities as an asset. The common securities were deemed to have a fair value of as of the AFN Merger date. These are accounted for as cost method investments; therefore, the Company does not adjust the value at each reporting period. Any income generated on the common securities is recorded as interest income, a component of interest expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 The junior subordinated notes have several financial covenants. Since the AFN Merger, Cohen Company Inc. has been in violation of one covenant of Alesco Capital Trust I. As a result of this violation, Cohen Company Inc. is prohibited from issuing additional debt that is either subordinated to or pari passu with the Alesco Capital Trust I debt. This violation does not prohibit Cohen Company Inc. from issuing senior debt or the Operating LLC from issuing debt of any kind. Cohen Company Inc. is in compliance with all other covenants of the junior subordinated notes. The Company does not consider this violation to have a material adverse impact on its operations or on its ability to obtain financing in the future.

 Stockholder Rights Plan 
 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the Rights Agreement between the Company and Computershare Inc., as rights agent (the Rights Agent ). 
 
 The Rights Agreement provides for a distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (each, a Right, and collectively, the Rights for each share of the Company s Common Stock outstanding to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2024 the Record Date ). Each Right entitles the registered holder thereof to purchase from the Company a unit (each, a Unit consisting of one ten -thousandth of a share of the Company s Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series C Preferred Stock ), at a purchase price of per Unit (the Purchase Price ), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement. 
 
 The Company s board of directors adopted the Rights Agreement in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use its carryforward (net operating loss, "NOL," and net capital loss, "NCL") deferred tax assets (the deferred tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations. The Company has experienced substantial operating and capital losses, and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Company may carry forward these losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future earnings and thus reduce the Company s federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the deferred tax assets do not otherwise become limited, the Company believes that it will be able to carry forward a significant amount of deferred tax assets, and therefore these deferred tax assets could be a substantial asset to the Company. However, if the Company experiences an Ownership Change, as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, its ability to use the deferred tax assets will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the deferred tax assets could be substantially limited and/or delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of those assets. 
 
 The Rights attached to all Common Stock certificates representing shares then outstanding and, in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock registered in book entry form Book Entry Shares by notation in book entry (which certificates for Common Stock and Book Entry Shares shall be deemed also to be certificates for Rights), and no separate Rights certificates will be distributed. 
 
 Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the Common Stock and a Distribution Date will occur upon the earlier of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below) (the Stock Acquisition Date and (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, an Acquiring Person means any person or entity who or which, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, is the beneficial owner of or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, but does not include the Company or any Exempted Person (as defined below). Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates, (ii) new Common Stock certificates after the Record Date will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference, and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Stock outstanding will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificate. 

Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, an Exempted Person is any person or entity who, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, is or may become, as of January 2, 2024, the beneficial owner of Common Stock and/or other securities exercisable for shares of Common Stock representing or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of January 2, 2024. However, any such person or entity will no longer be deemed to be an Exempted Person and shall be deemed an Acquiring Person under the Rights Agreement if such person or entity, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, becomes the beneficial owner (and so long as such person continues to be the beneficial owner of 4.95 or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock) of additional shares of Common Stock, except x pursuant to equity compensation awards granted to such person or entity by the Company or options or warrants outstanding and beneficially owned by such person or entity as of January 2, 2024, or as a result of an adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such equity compensation award pursuant to the terms thereof; or (y) as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or the like. In addition, any person or entity who, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, becomes the beneficial owner of Common Stock and/or other securities exercisable for shares of Common Stock representing 4.95 or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding as a result of a purchase by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of shares of Common Stock will also be an Exempted Person. However, any such person will no longer be deemed to be an Exempted Person and will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person if such person, together with all affiliates and associates of such person, becomes the beneficial owner, at any time after the date such person became the beneficial owner of 4.95 or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, of additional shares of Common Stock, except if such additional securities are acquired x pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants to purchase Common Stock outstanding and beneficially owned by such person as of the date such person became the beneficial owner of 4.95 or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or as a result of an adjustment to the number of shares of Common Stock for which such options or warrants are exercisable pursuant to the terms thereof, or (y) as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or the like. 
 
 In addition, the Rights Agreement defined the term Exempted Person to also include any person or entity who, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, is the beneficial owner of Common Stock and/or other securities exercisable for shares of Common Stock representing 4.95 or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding, and whose beneficial ownership would not, as determined by the Company s board of directors, jeopardize or endanger the availability of the Company of its deferred tax assets. However, any such person or entity will cease to be an Exempted Person if x such person or entity ceases to beneficially own 4.95 or more of the shares of the then outstanding Common Stock or (y) the Company s board of directors makes a contrary determination with respect to the effect of such person s or entity s beneficial ownership (together with all affiliates and associates of such person) with respect to the availability to the Company of its deferred tax assets. 
 
 Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, a purchaser, assignee or transferee of the shares of Common Stock (or options or warrants exercisable for Common Stock) from an Exempted Person will not be considered an Exempted Person, except that a transferee from the estate of an Exempted Person who receives Common Stock as a bequest or inheritance from an Exempted Person will be an Exempted Person so long as such transferee continues to be the beneficial owner of 4.95 or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock. 
 
 The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire on the earliest of (i) the close of business on December 31, 2026, ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged pursuant to the Rights Agreement, (iv) the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Company s board of directors determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of certain tax benefits, and (v) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Company s board of directors determines that certain tax benefits may not be carried forward. At no time will the Rights have any voting power. 
 
 Except as otherwise determined by the Company s board of directors, only shares of Common Stock issued prior to the Distribution Date will be issued with Rights. 
 
 Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, in the event that a person or entity becomes an Acquiring Person, each other holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company), having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. The exercise price is the Purchase Price times the number of Units associated with each Right (initially, one ). For example, at an exercise price of 100.00 per Right, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person (or by certain related parties) following an event set forth in the preceding paragraph would entitle its holder to purchase worth of Common Stock (or other consideration, as noted above) for 100.00. If the Common Stock at the time of exercise had a market value per share of , the holder of each valid Right would be entitled to purchase ten 10 shares of Common Stock for . 
 
 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, following the occurrence of a person or entity becoming an Acquiring Person (a Flip-In Event ), all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by such Acquiring Person will be null and void. 
 
 In the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, (i) the Company engages in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is not the surviving corporation; (ii) the Company engages in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the Company is the surviving corporation and the Common Stock is changed or exchanged; or (iii) or more of the Company s assets, cash flow or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right (except Rights which have previously been voided as set forth above) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. 
 
 However, Rights are not exercisable following the occurrence of a Flip-In Event until such time as the Rights are no longer redeemable by the Company as set forth below. 
 
 The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Units of Series C Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) if holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are granted certain rights or warrants to subscribe for Series C Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). 
 
 With certain exceptions, no adjustments in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least of the Purchase Price. fractional Units will be issued and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Series C Preferred Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise. 
 
 At any time after the Stock Acquisition Date, the Company may exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights owned by an Acquiring Person) for Common Stock at an exchange ratio equal to (i) a number of shares of Common Stock per Right with a value equal to the spread between the value of the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Rights may then be exercised and the Purchase Price or (ii) if prior to the acquisition by the Acquiring Person of 50 or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, one share of Common Stock per Right (subject to adjustment). 

At any time until ten days following the Stock Acquisition Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of per Right. Immediately upon the action of the Company s board of directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price. 
 
 Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to shareholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for Common Stock (or other consideration) of the Company as set forth above or in the event the Rights are redeemed. 
 
 Other than those provisions relating to the principal economic terms of the Rights, any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Company s board of directors prior to the Distribution Date. After the Distribution Date, the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Company s board of directors in order to cure any ambiguity, to make changes which do not adversely affect the interests of holders of Rights (excluding the interests of any Acquiring Person), or to shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement; provided, however, that no amendment to adjust the time period governing redemption shall be made at such time as the Rights are not redeemable.

Cohen, the Company s executive chairman, in accordance with the Operating LLC operating agreement, redeemed LLC Units for which the Company paid to Mr. Cohen an aggregate of , or per LLC Unit. The LLC Units were redeemed by Mr. Cohen in order to fund certain tax liabilities incurred by Mr. Cohen in connection with the vesting, on January 31, 2024, of restricted LLC Units that had been previously granted to Mr. Cohen under the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan. On February 1, 2023, Daniel G. Cohen, in accordance with the Operating LLC operating agreement, redeemed LLC Units for which the Company paid to Mr. Cohen an aggregate of , or per LLC Unit.

. The Company's effective tax rate is significantly different than this rate for the following reasons. 
 
 1. Cohen Company Inc. consolidates the Operating LLC but only owns a minority economic interest in the Operating LLC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Cohen Company Inc. owned of the economic interests of the Operating LLC (on average) and was allocated the same percentage of income/(loss) generated by the Operating LLC. To the extent Cohen Company Inc. incurs tax obligations on this, the related tax expense is recognized in these consolidated financial statements. The remaining that is allocated to the non-controlling members of the Operating LLC is subject to taxation on such members' tax returns. 
 
 2. The Operating LLC itself consolidates certain pass-through entities. Therefore, the income/(loss) of these entities is included in the Company's consolidated results but no tax expense/(benefit) related to the unowned portion is included. 
 
 3 There are state, local, and foreign taxes to which the Operating LLC or its subsidiaries are subject to, which are included in the effective tax rate. 
 
 4. The Company also has valuation allowances applied against its carryforward NOL and NCL deferred tax assets as well as its tax over book basis in the Operating LLC. Valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets when management determines that the assets may not be fully realized. This determination requires significant judgement and is primarily based on management's expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income. ASC 740 indicates that all available evidence should be considered when assessing the need for and the appropriate level of a valuation allowance. All available evidence includes historical information supplemented by all currently available information about future periods.

(that is, those held by the non-controlling interest) may be redeemed and exchanged into shares of the Company on a ten -for- one basis. The LLC Units not held by Cohen Company Inc. are redeemable, at the member s option at any time, for (i) cash in an amount equal to the average of the per share closing prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company receives the member s redemption notice, or (ii) at the Company s option, one tenth of a share of the Common Stock, subject, in each case, to appropriate adjustment upon the occurrence of an issuance of additional shares of the Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution on the outstanding Common Stock, or a further subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock. These LLC Units are not included in the computation of basic earnings per share. These LLC Units enter into the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share when the effect is not anti-dilutive using the if-converted method.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Cohen Company Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, we, us, our, or the Company should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including fair value of financial instruments. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 All amounts in this disclosure are in thousands (except share, unit, per share, and per unit data) except where otherwise noted. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a financial services company specializing in an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services. We are organized into three business segments: Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing. 

Capital Markets : Our Capital Markets business segment consists primarily of fixed income sales, trading, gestation repo financing, new issue placements in corporate and securitized products, and advisory services. Our fixed income sales and trading group provides trade execution to corporate investors, institutional investors, mortgage originators, and other smaller broker-dealers. We specialize in a variety of products, including but not limited to: corporate bonds, ABS, MBS, RMBS, CDOs, CLOs, CBOs, CMOs, municipal securities, TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts, SBA loans, U.S. government bonds, U.S. government agency securities, brokered deposits and CDs for small banks, and hybrid capital of financial institutions including TruPS, whole loans, and other structured financial instruments. We carry out our capital markets activities primarily through our subsidiaries: JVB in the United States and CCFESA in Europe. A division of JVB, Cohen Company Capital Markets ("CCM") is our full-service boutique investment bank that provides innovative strategic and financial advice in M A, underwriting, capital markets and SPAC advisory. 

Asset Management : Our Asset Management business segment manages assets within CDOs, managed accounts, joint ventures, and investment funds (collectively, Investment Vehicles ). A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes backed by the assets. In the event of default, the lenders will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. Our Asset Management business segment includes our fee-based asset management operations, which include on-going base and incentive management fees. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.37 billion in assets under management AUM of which 41 was in CDOs. A significant portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, liquidations, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles that were more recently formed. 

Principal Investing : Our Principal Investing business segment is comprised of investments that we hold related to our SPAC franchise and other investments we have made for the purpose of earning an investment return rather than investments made to support our trading and other Capital Markets business segment activities. In addition, we have received financial instruments as consideration for advisory services provided by our Capital Markets business segment that are included in this segment. These investments are included in our other investments, at fair value; other investments sold, not yet purchased; and investments in equity method affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets. 

We generate our revenue by business segment primarily through the following activities. 
 
 Capital Markets: 

Our trading activities, which include execution and brokerage services, riskless trading activities as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities and derivatives classified as trading; 

Revenue earned on our gestation repo financing activities; and 

New issue and advisory revenue comprised primarily of (a) origination fees for newly created financial instruments originated by us; (b) revenue from advisory services; (c) underwriting and (d) new issue revenue associated with origination, arranging, or placing newly created financial instruments. 

Asset Management: 

Asset management fees for our on-going asset management services provided to certain Investment Vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities issued in the Investment Vehicle; and 

Incentive management fees earned based on the performance of Investment Vehicles. 

Principal Investing: 

Gains and losses (unrealized and realized) and income and expense earned on securities classified as other investments, at fair value and other investments sold, not yet purchased; and 

Income and loss earned on equity method investments.

Business Environment 
 
 Our business in general and our Capital Markets and Principal Investing business segments in particular do not produce predictable earnings. Our results can vary dramatically from year to year and quarter to quarter. Our business is materially affected by economic conditions in the financial markets, political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the housing and mortgage markets, changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions, and changes in interest rates, including overnight funding rates, all of which can affect our profitability and are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors and companies, including their level of participation in the financial markets and their willingness to participate in corporate transactions. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and revenues, negatively affect our ability to generate new issue and advisory revenue, and adversely affect our profitability. 
 
 As a general rule, our trading business benefits from increased market volatility. Increased volatility usually results in increased activity from our clients and counterparties. However, periods of extreme volatility may at times result in clients reducing their trading volumes, which would negatively impact our results. Also, periods of extreme volatility may result in large fluctuations in securities valuations and we may incur losses on our holdings. Also, our mortgage group s business benefits when mortgage volumes increase, and may suffer when mortgage volumes decrease. Among other things, mortgage volumes are significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, as a smaller firm, we are exposed to intense competition. Although we provide financing to our customers, larger firms have a much greater capability to provide their clients with financing, giving them a competitive advantage. We are much more reliant upon our employees relationships, networks, and abilities to identify and capitalize on market opportunities. Therefore, our business may be significantly impacted by the addition or loss of key personnel. 
 
 We try to address these challenges by (i) focusing our business on clients and asset classes that are underserved by the large firms, (ii) continuing to monitor our fixed costs to enhance operating leverage and limit our losses during periods of low volumes, and (iii) attempting to hire and retain entrepreneurial and effective traders, investment bankers, and salespeople. Our business environment is rapidly changing. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously and it is not possible for us to predict all the risks we will face. This may negatively impact our operating performance. 
 
 A portion of our revenue is generated from net trading activity. We engage in proprietary trading for our own account, provide securities financing for our customers, and execute riskless trades with a customer order in hand resulting in limited market risk to us. The inventory of securities held for our own account, as well as held to facilitate customer trades, and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements. 
 
 A portion of our revenue is generated from new issue and advisory engagements. The fees charged and volume of these engagements are sensitive to the overall business environment. We provide origination services in Europe through our subsidiary CCFESA, and new issue and advisory services in the U.S. through our subsidiary JVB. A division of JVB, CCM is our full-service boutique investment bank, which focuses on M A, underwriting, capital markets and SPAC advisory. Currently, our primary source of new issue and advisory revenue is from investment banking and advisory services through CCM, as well as from originating assets for our U.S. and European insurance asset management business and CREO JV. 
 
 A portion of our revenue is generated from management fees. Our ability to charge management fees and the amount of those fees is dependent upon the underlying investment performance and stability of the Investment Vehicles. If these types of investments do not provide attractive returns to investors, the demand for such instruments will likely fall, thereby reducing our opportunity to earn new management fees or maintain existing management fees. As of September 30, 2024, 41 of our existing AUM were in CDOs. The creation of CDOs has depended upon a vibrant securitization market. Since 2008, volumes within the securitization market have dropped significantly and have not fully recovered since that time. We have not completed a new securitization since 2008. The remaining portion of our AUM is from a diversified mix of other Investment Vehicles most of which were more recently formed. 
 
 A significant portion of our asset management revenue is earned from the management of CDOs. As a result, our asset management revenue has declined from its historical highs as the assets of the CDOs decline due to maturities, repayments, auction call redemptions, liquidations, and defaults. Our ability to complete securitizations in the future will depend upon, among other things, our asset origination capacity and success, our ability to arrange warehouse financing to originate assets, our willingness and capacity to fund required amounts to obtain warehouse financing and securitized financings, and the demand in the markets for such securitizations. 
 
 A portion of our revenues is generated from our principal investing activities. Therefore, our revenues are impacted by the overall market supply and demand of these investments as well as the individual performance of each investment. Our principal investments are included within other investments, at fair value; other investments sold, not yet purchased; and investments in equity method affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets. More recently, a significant component of our principal investment revenue has come from SPAC related equity investments, primarily in entities that have been the result of sponsored SPAC business combinations, SFA transactions, or related party sponsored SPAC business combinations. In addition, in recent quarters, we have received significant portions of new issue and advisory revenue in the form of financial instruments rather than cash. Typically, these financial instruments are carried at fair value and included as a component of our Principal Investing segment. Performance of the resulting principal investments can be materially impacted by overall performance of the equity markets. See notes 7 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The SPAC Market 
 
 In 2018, we began sponsoring a series of SPACs. Each sponsored SPAC either completed or was seeking to complete a business combination with a company involved in the insurance market. In addition, we invest in other SPACs at various stages of their business life cycle. Beginning in 2019, these SPAC activities have become a significant portion of our Principal Investing business segment. In August 2018, we invested in and became the general partner of a newly formed investment fund (the SPAC Fund ), which was created for the purpose of investing in the equity interests of SPACs and SPAC sponsor entities including SPACs sponsored by us, our affiliates, and third parties. Effective April 1, 2023, all of the investors in the SPAC Fund, other than Vellar GP, redeemed all of their interests in the SPAC Fund. See recent events below for discussion of our consolidation of the SPAC Fund. 
 
 As a complement to the SPAC Fund, we established and became manager of two newly formed umbrella limited liability companies (the SPAC Series Funds that issue a separate series of interest for each investment portfolio, which typically consists of investments in the sponsor entities of individual SPACs. Generally, when a SPAC acquires or merges with a privately held target company, the target company winds up owning a majority of the resulting outstanding equity of the SPAC so the transaction is accounted for as a reverse merger. Private companies utilize reverse mergers with SPACs as a method of going public as an alternative to a traditional IPO. All of our business activity related to SPACs is highly sensitive to the volume of activity in the SPAC market. Volumes could be negatively impacted if target companies no longer see SPACs as an attractive alternative thereby reducing the number of suitable potential business combination targets. Also, investor demand for SPACs would be negatively impacted if the stock of SPACs that successfully complete a business combination underperform the market. If volumes of SPAC activity decline, our results of operations will likely be significantly negatively impacted. 
 
 Equity prices of SPACs and post business combination SPACs declined significantly during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. We are exposed to public equity prices of SPACs and post business combination SPACs both through our other investments, at fair value and investments in equity method affiliates. As a result, we recorded significant principal transaction losses and equity method losses during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 in certain SPAC related investments. Continued declines in the equity prices of these companies will result in further losses for us. 
 
 Margin Pressures in Fixed Income Brokerage Business 
 
 Performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of the economy and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors beyond our control and can be unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors including the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of the various yield curves, and the volume and value of trading in securities. 

Margins and volumes in certain products and markets within the fixed income brokerage business continue to decrease materially as competition has increased and general market activity has declined. Further, we continue to expect that competition will increase over time, resulting in continued margin pressure. 
 
 Our response to this margin compression has included: (i) building a diversified fixed income trading platform, (ii) acquiring or building out new product lines and expanding existing product lines, (iii) building a hedging execution and funding operation to service mortgage originators, (iv) building out CCM, and (v) monitoring our fixed costs. Our cost management initiatives are ongoing. However, there can be no certainty that these efforts will be sufficient. If insufficient, we will likely see a decline in profitability. 
 
 U.S. Housing Market 
 
 In recent years, our mortgage group has grown in significance to our Capital Markets segment and our company overall. The mortgage group primarily earns revenue by providing hedging execution, securities financing, and trade execution services to mortgage originators and other investors in mortgage-backed securities. Therefore, this group s revenue is highly dependent on the volume of mortgage originations in the U.S. Origination activity is highly sensitive to interest rates, the U.S. job market, housing starts, sale activity of existing housing stock, as well as the general health of the U.S. economy. In addition, any new regulation that impacts U.S. government agency mortgage-backed security issuance activity, residential mortgage underwriting standards, or otherwise impacts mortgage originators will impact our business. We have no control over these external factors and there is no effective way for us to hedge against these risks. Our mortgage group s volumes and profitability will be highly impacted by these external factors. 
 
 Interest Rates and Inflation 
 
 During 2022 and 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve began a process of raising the federal funds rate and quantitative tightening to address rising inflation. Recently, the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the first time in several years. It is unclear as to whether or how quickly interest rates will continue to decline. However, for most of the periods presented herein, rates were rising or elevated versus historical lows, which negatively impacted our business in several ways 

1. 
 Rising rates reduce the fair value of the fixed income securities that we hold on our balance sheet. 

2. 
 Rising rates create instability in the equity markets, which has reduced equity financing and business combination volumes and negatively impacted CCM. 

3. 
 Rising rates reduce the volumes of new issue fixed income instruments, which has negatively impacted our CREO JV. 

4. 
 Rising rates significantly reduce mortgage activity. Our mortgage group's profitability is mainly impacted by the volume of mortgage activity in the U.S. (both mortgages for new home purchases as well as refinancing). Furthermore, our mortgage group engages in repo lending to mortgage originators. Reduced mortgage volumes impose financial pressures on mortgage originators and may increase the risk that originators default on their repo obligations to us. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

5. 
 Rising rates may ultimately push the U.S. into recession, which may further reduce overall transaction volumes in the financial markets negatively impacting our business generally.

Therefore, effective April 1, 2023, Vellar GP became the sole owner of the SPAC Fund and began consolidating it. Because we consolidate Vellar GP, we began consolidating the SPAC Fund effective April 1, 2023 as well. The following table represents the assets and liabilities of the SPAC Fund upon consolidation by us:

Our net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not under our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 7, 8, and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The fair value estimates made by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold. We consider our gestation repo business to be subject to significant concentration risk. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Asset Management 
 
 Our AUM equals the sum of the NAV or gross assets of the Investment Vehicles we manage based on whichever measurement serves as the basis for the calculation of our management fees. 
 
 Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations used by other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. This definition of AUM is not necessarily identical to the definitions of AUM that may be used in our management agreements.

(1) Other Investment Vehicles include any Investment Vehicle that is not a Company-sponsored CDO. 
 (2) In some cases, accounts we manage may employ leverage. Further, in some cases, our fees are based on gross assets and in other cases, our fees are based on net assets. Finally, in the case of the SPAC Series Funds there are no management fees earned. AUM included herein is calculated using either gross or net assets of each managed account or CDO based on whichever serves as the basis for our management fees. In the case where no management fees are earned, the net assets are included. 

Asset management fees increased by 1,524, or 28 , to 6,942 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5,418 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as discussed in more detail below. The following table provides a more detailed comparison of the two periods.

Asset management fees from CDOs remained relatively flat. Asset management fees from other increased primarily due to the recognition in 2024 of deferred performance fees related to certain PriDe Funds and due to the portfolio servicing fee on the notional amount of loans owned by the CREO JV.

Our revenue earned from new issue and advisory has been, and we expect will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of new issue and advisory engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of such engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue we recognize. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our new issue and advisory revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our new issue and advisory revenue recognition. In addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue and advisory engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other, and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. 
 
 CCM, a division of JVB, is our full-service boutique investment bank, which focuses on M A, underwriting, capital markets and SPAC advisory services. In addition, we generate new issue revenue by originating new assets for the U.S. Insurance JV, CREO JV, and our PriDe Funds in Europe. 
 
 In some cases, CCM will receive financial instruments in lieu of cash for its advisory transactions. In these cases, we record advisory revenue equal to the fair value of the instruments received. Subsequent to receipt, the instruments are carried at fair value as a component of other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Any change in the fair value of these instruments subsequent to recording the new issue revenue will be recorded as principal transactions gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations. Further, the financial instruments we receive in these cases are often either (i) common stock investments that are restricted for resale for some period of time; (ii) convertible or non-convertible debt investments that are not publicly traded; (iii) equity investments in special purpose entities that are not publicly traded; or (iv) unrestricted common stock investments in public companies with low trading volumes. As a result of the above, it may take us a significant period of time to liquidate these financial instruments. We may suffer significant principal transactions loss prior to final liquidation of these financial instruments, which may impact the results of our Principal Investing segment.

Table of Contents 

Interests in Public Companies 
 
 These investments represent our direct and indirect investments in certain public companies. These investments may be in the form of unrestricted common stock, restricted common stock, equity derivatives, convertible notes, non-convertible notes, fair value receivables, as well as equity interest in SPVs that have investments in these public companies. The name and ticker symbol of each public company in which we have a direct or indirect investment is listed in the table above. The amounts shown represent the change in the fair value of our investment in each time period noted in the table. Many of the interests in the public companies listed above were acquired as non-cash compensation related to new issue and advisory engagements. When we received these investments, we recorded new issue and advisory revenue for the fair value of those instruments at that time. 
 
 Other Principal Investments 
 
 The bridge loan exit fee represents amounts earned upon repayment of a bridge loan made to an early stage growth company. 
 
 We have engaged in several SFAs. In a typical SFA transaction, we acquire an interest in a publicly traded company and enter into an offsetting derivative with the same company. Both the interest in the public company and the offsetting derivative are carried at fair value. The amount shown in the table above represents the net change in fair value recorded during the period. The interests we hold in SFA Counterparties are included as a component of other investments, at fair value. The derivatives are included as a component of other investments sold, not yet purchased, at fair value. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding our SFAs. 
 
 The U.S. Insurance JV invests in insurance company debt. We carry our investment in the U.S. Insurance JV at its reported NAV.

The large deferred income tax expense recorded in 2023 was mainly the result of an increase in the valuation allowance related to our NOL and NCL tax assets. According to ASC 740 Income Taxes, we should record an offsetting valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets in an amount such that the net asset recognized represents amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination, we must estimate the future amounts of taxable income it will generate in each taxing jurisdiction. We then must consider the remaining statutory time period available for each carryforward asset, as well as other statutory limitations on usage such as annual limits and income type limits (capital vs. ordinary). Due to significant losses incurred in 2023 and prior as well as overall market conditions we face generally, we revised downward in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 the amount of carryforward assets we believed will be realizable in the future above a more likely than not standard. We did not record a similar adjustment in 2024. 
 
 Our provision for income taxes fluctuates due to several factors mostly attributable to our legal structure, which are summarized as follows. 
 
 Cohen Company Inc. is treated as a C corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. A U.S. C corporation is subject to a federal tax rate of 21 . The Company's effective tax rate is significantly different than this rate for the following reasons: 
 
 1. Cohen Company Inc. consolidates the Operating LLC but only owns a minority economic interest in the Operating LLC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cohen Company Inc. owned 28.4 of the economic interests of the Operating LLC (on average) and was allocated the same percentage of income/(loss) generated by the Operating LLC. To the extent Cohen Company Inc. incurs tax obligations on this amount, the related tax expense is recognized in these consolidated financial statements. The remaining 71.6 that was allocated to the non-controlling members of the Operating LLC is subject to taxation on such members' tax returns. 
 
 2. The Operating LLC itself consolidates certain pass-through entities. Therefore, the income/(loss) of these entities is included in the Company's consolidated results, but no tax expense/(benefit) related to the unowned portions is included. 
 
 3. There are state, local, and foreign taxes to which the Operating LLC or its subsidiaries are subject to, which are included in the effective tax rate. 
 
 4. We also have valuation allowances applied against our NOL and NCL carryforward deferred tax assets as well as our tax over book basis in the Operating LLC. Valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets when management determines that the assets may not be fully realized. This determination requires significant judgement and is primarily based on management's expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income. ASC 740 indicates that all available evidence should be considered when assessing the need for and the appropriate level of a valuation allowance. All available evidence includes historical information supplemented by all currently available information about future periods.

 Non-controlling interest is recorded on a quarterly basis. Because earnings are recognized unevenly throughout the year and the non-controlling interest percentage may change during the period, the average effective non-controlling interest percentage may not equal the percentage at the end of any period or the simple average of the beginning and ending percentages.

Our net trading revenue includes unrealized gains on our trading investments as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized due to changes in market or other conditions not under our control. This may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from these investments. In addition, our net trading revenue also includes realized gains on certain proprietary trading positions. Our ability to derive trading gains from such trading positions is subject to overall market conditions. Due to volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, the net trading revenue recognized may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, from time to time, some of the assets included in the investments-trading line of our consolidated balance sheets represent level 3 valuations within the FASB valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets are carried at fair value based on estimates derived using internal valuation models and other estimates. See notes 7, 8, and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The fair value estimates made by us may not be indicative of the final sale price at which these assets may be sold. We consider our gestation repo business to be subject to significant concentration risk. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Asset Management 
 
 Our AUM equals the sum of the NAV or gross assets of the Investment Vehicles we manage based on whichever measurement serves as the basis for the calculation of our management fees. 
 
 Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations used by other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. This definition of AUM is not necessarily identical to the definitions of AUM that may be used in our management agreements.

 (2) In some cases, accounts we manage may employ leverage. Further, in some cases, our fees are based on gross assets and in other cases, our fees are based on net assets. Finally, in the case of the SPAC Series Funds there are no management fees earned. AUM included herein is calculated using either gross or net assets of each managed account or CDO based on whichever serves as the basis for our management fees. In the case where no management fees are earned, the net assets are included. 

Asset management fees increased by 359, or 20 , to 2,147 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,788 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as discussed in more detail below. The following table provides a more detailed comparison of the two periods:

Asset management fees from CDOs remained relatively flat. Asset management fees from other increased primarily due to the recognition in 2024 of deferred performance fees related to a certain PriDe Fund and due to the portfolio servicing fee on the notional amount of loans owned by the CREO JV.

Our revenue earned from new issue and advisory has been, and we expect will continue to be, volatile. We earn revenue from a limited number of engagements. Therefore, a small change in the number of engagements can result in large fluctuations in the revenue recognized. Further, even if the number of engagements remains consistent, the average revenue per engagement can fluctuate considerably. Finally, our revenue is generally earned when an underlying transaction closes (rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis). Therefore, the timing of underlying transactions increases the volatility of our revenue recognition. In addition, we often incur certain costs related to new issue engagements. These costs are included as a component of either subscriptions, clearing and execution, or professional fees and other, and will generally be recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. 
 
 CCM, a division of JVB, is our full-service boutique investment bank, which focuses on M A, underwriting, capital markets and SPAC advisory services. In addition, we generate new issue revenue by originating new assets for the U.S. Insurance JV, CREO JV, and our PriDe Funds in Europe. 
 
 In some cases, CCM will receive financial instruments in lieu of cash for its advisory transactions. In these cases, we record advisory revenue equal to the fair value of the instruments received. Subsequent to receipt, the instruments are carried at fair value as a component of other investments, at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Any change in the fair value of these instruments subsequent to recording the new issue revenue will be recorded as principal transactions gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. Further, it should be noted that the financial instruments we receive in these cases are often either (i) common stock investments that are restricted for resale for some period of time; (ii) convertible or non-convertible debt investments that are not publicly traded; (iii) equity investments in special purpose entities that are not publicly traded; or (iv) unrestricted common stock investments in public companies but the companies do not have significant trading volume. Therefore, it may take us a significant period of time to liquidate these investments. We may suffer significant principal transactions loss prior to final liquidation of these financial instruments, which will impact the results of our Principal Investing segment.

Table of Contents 

Interests in Public Companies 
 
 These items represent our direct and indirect investments in certain public companies. These investments may be in the form of unrestricted common stock, restricted common stock, equity derivatives, convertible notes, non-convertible notes, fair value receivables, as well as equity interest in SPVs that have investments in these public companies. The name and ticker symbol of each public company in which we have a direct or indirect investment is listed in the table above. The amounts shown represent the change in the fair value of our investment in each time period noted in the table. Many of the interests in the public companies listed above were acquired as non-cash compensation related to new issue and advisory engagements. When we received these investments, we recorded new issue and advisory revenue for the fair value of those instruments at that time. 
 
 Other Principal Investments 
 
 The bridge loan exit fee represents amounts earned upon repayment of a bridge loan made to an early stage growth company. 
 
 We have engaged in several SFAs. In a typical SFA transaction, we acquire an interest in a publicly traded company and enter into an offsetting derivative with the same company. Both the interest in the public company and the offsetting derivative are carried at fair value. The amount shown in the table above represents the net change in fair value recorded during the period. The interests we hold in SFA Counterparties are included as a component of other investments, at fair value. The derivatives are included as a component of other investments sold, not yet purchased, at fair value. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding our SFAs. 
 
 The U.S. Insurance JV invests in insurance company debt. We carry our investment in the U.S. Insurance JV at its reported NAV. 
 
 Stoa USA Inc. / FlipOS was a private company in which we owned common equity. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, Stoa USA Inc. / FlipOS announced it had ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. We wrote of our investment in 2023. We have no remaining investment in Stoa USA Inc. / FlipOS. 
 
 The CREO JV invests in primarily multi-family commercial real estate mortgage-backed loans. We carry our investment in the CREO JV at its reported NAV. 
 
 Other principal investments consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses from other investments reported at fair value. 
 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 
 Other income / (loss) is comprised of an ongoing revenue share arrangement as well as other miscellaneous operating income items. The revenue share arrangement noted in the table above entitles us to a percentage of revenue earned by IIFC. The IIFC revenue share arrangement expires at the earlier of (i) the dissolution of IIFC or (ii) when we have earned a cumulative 20,000 in revenue share payments. To date, we have earned 8,133 in connection with this revenue share arrangement.

 If a SPAC sponsor entity distributes SPAC shares to us, we account for those SPAC shares as a component of other investments, at fair value. For several of the equity method investments described below, we also had an investment in the same company accounted for at fair value as a component of other investments, at fair value during the periods presented. Changes in fair value of those investments are included as a component of principal transactions and other income. The table below shows the equity method income / (loss) included in SPAC sponsor entities and other above broken out by the ultimate public company investee. See discussion of principal transactions above. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our provision for income taxes fluctuates due to several factors mostly attributable to our legal structure, which are summarized as follows: 
 
 Cohen Company Inc. is treated as a C corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. A U.S. C corporation is subject to a federal tax rate of 21 . The Company's effective tax rate is significantly different than this rate for the following reasons. 
 
 1. Cohen Company Inc. consolidates the Operating LLC but only owns a minority economic interest in the Operating LLC. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Cohen Company Inc. owned 28.4 of the economic interests of the Operating LLC (on average) and was allocated the same percentage of income/(loss) generated by the Operating LLC. To the extent Cohen Company Inc. incurs tax obligations on this amount, the related tax expense is recognized in our consolidated financial statements. The remaining 71.6 of income/(loss) generated by the Operating LLC was allocated to the non-controlling members of the Operating LLC and is subject to taxation on such members' individual tax returns. 
 
 2. The Operating LLC itself consolidates certain pass-through entities. Therefore, the income/(loss) of these entities is included in the Company's consolidated results, but no tax expense/(benefit) related to the unowned portions of these entities is included in the Company's consolidated results. 
 
 3. There are state, local, and foreign taxes to which the Operating LLC or its subsidiaries are subject to, which are included in the Company's effective tax rate. 
 
 4. We also have valuation allowances applied against our NOL and NCL carryforward deferred tax assets as well as our tax over book basis in the Operating LLC. Valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets when management determines that the assets may not be fully realized. This determination requires significant judgement and is primarily based on management's expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income. ASC 740 indicates that all available evidence should be considered when assessing the need for and the appropriate level of a valuation allowance. All available evidence includes historical information supplemented by all currently available information about future periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements including ongoing commitments to repay debt borrowings, make interest payments on outstanding borrowings, fund investments, and support other general business purposes. In addition, our United States and European broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain minimum levels of net capital. Historically, our primary sources of funds have been our operating activities and general corporate borrowings. In addition, our trading operations have generally been financed by the use of collateralized securities financing arrangements as well as margin loans. 
 
 Certain subsidiaries of the Operating LLC have restrictions on the withdrawal of capital and otherwise in making distributions and loans. JVB is subject to net capital restrictions imposed by the SEC and FINRA that require certain minimum levels of net capital to remain in this subsidiary. In addition, these restrictions could potentially impose notice requirements or limit our ability to withdraw capital above the required minimum amounts (excess capital) whether through a distribution or a loan. CCFESA is subject to the regulations of the ACPR, which imposes minimum capital requirements. See note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations below. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2010, our board of directors initiated a dividend of 0.50 per quarter, which was paid regularly through December 31, 2011. Beginning in 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.20 per quarter, which was paid regularly through the first quarter of 2019. Each time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders. 
 
 On July 29, 2021, our board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend declaring a cash dividend of 0.25 per share. We have paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 regularly since that date. In addition to our routine quarterly distribution, on March 8, 2022, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of 0.75 per share. On November 4, 2024, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share on its Common Stock. The dividends are payable on December 5, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 20, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

We repaid redeemable financial instruments of 2,573, 

We paid dividends of 1,465 and distributions to convertible non-controlling interest of 3,837, and 

We made distributions to the non-convertible non-controlling interest of 3,671. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 

We drew and repaid 15,000 on the Byline Credit Facility, 

We paid dividends of 1,369 and distributions to the convertible non-controlling interest of 3,341, and 

We made distributions to the non-convertible non-controlling interest of 2,400. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no other financing transactions in excess of 1,000. This excludes non-cash transactions. See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

Cash Flows 
 
 We have seven primary uses for capital: 

(1) 
 To fund the operations of our Capital Markets business segment . Our Capital Markets business segment utilizes capital (i) to fund securities inventory to facilitate client trading activities; (ii) for risk trading for our own account; (iii) to fund our collateralized securities lending activities; (iv) for temporary capital needs associated with underwriting activities; (v) to fund business expansion into existing or new product lines including additional capital dedicated to our mortgage group as well as our gestation repo business; and (vi) to fund any operating losses incurred. 

(2) 
 To fund the expansion of our Asset Management business segment . We generally grow our AUM by sponsoring new Investment Vehicles. The creation of a new Investment Vehicle often requires us to invest a certain amount of our own capital to attract outside capital to manage. Also, these new Investment Vehicles often require warehouse and other third-party financing to fund the acquisition of investments. Finally, we generally will hire employees to manage new Investment Vehicles and will operate at a loss for a startup period. 

(3) 
 To fund investments . We make principal investments (including sponsor and other investments in SPACs) to generate returns. We may need to raise additional debt or equity financing in order to ensure we have the capital necessary to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. 

(4) 
 To fund mergers or acquisitions . We may opportunistically use capital to acquire other asset managers, individual asset management contracts, or financial services firms. To the extent our liquidity sources are insufficient to fund our future merger or acquisition activities, we may need to raise additional funding through an equity or debt offering. No assurances can be given that additional financing will be available in the future, or that if available, such financing will be on favorable terms. 

(5) 
 To fund potential dividends and distributions . We sometimes pay dividends. Each time a cash dividend was declared by our board of directors, a pro rata distribution was made to the other members of the Operating LLC upon payment of dividends to our stockholders. 

(6) 
 To fund potential repurchases of Common Stock. We have opportunistically repurchased Common Stock in private transactions. 

(7) 
 To pay off debt as it matures. We have indebtedness that must be repaid as it matures. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

If we are unable to raise sufficient capital on economically favorable terms, we may need to reduce the amount of capital invested for the uses described above, which may adversely impact earnings and our ability to pay dividends. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained cash and cash equivalents of 14,290 and 10,650, respectively. We generated cash from or used cash for the activities described below.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
 We have two subsidiaries that are licensed securities dealers: JVB in the United States and CCFESA in France. As a U.S. broker-dealer, JVB is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule in Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. CCFESA is subject to the regulations of the ACPR. The amount of net assets that these subsidiaries may distribute is subject to restrictions under the applicable net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. Our minimum capital requirements at September 30, 2024 were as follows.

We operate with more than the minimum regulatory capital requirement in our licensed broker-dealers and at September 30, 2024, total net capital, or the equivalent as defined by the relevant statutory regulations, in our licensed broker-dealers totaled 52,437. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, our licensed broker-dealers are generally subject to capital withdrawal notification and restrictions. 
 
 Restrictions of Distributions of Capital from JVB 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total equity on a consolidated basis was 100,625 and the total equity of JVB was 85,816. Therefore, only 14,809 of equity existed outside of JVB. However, it should be noted that our non-convertible non-controlling interest represents equity that is included in our consolidated financial statements but is not available to the Operating LLC to fund operations outside of those specific consolidated but not wholly owned subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, our non-convertible non-controlling interest balance was 14,482. Therefore, we have available equity outside of JVB of 327 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 From time to time, we may need to take distributions of income (and potentially returns of capital) from JVB to satisfy the cash needs as a result of the losses incurred outside of JVB or to satisfy other obligations that come due outside of JVB. However, we are subject to significant limitations on our ability to make distributions from JVB. These limitations include limitations imposed by FINRA under Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act (described immediately above) and limitations under our line of credit with Byline Bank (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Furthermore, counterparties to JVB have their own internal counterparty credit requirements. The specific requirements are not generally shared with us. However, if we take too much in capital distributions from JVB (beyond its net income), we may not be able to trade with certain counterparties, which may cause JVB s operations to deteriorate.

Securities Financing 
 
 We maintain repurchase agreements with various third-party institutions. There is no maximum limit as to the amount of securities that may be transferred pursuant to these agreements, and transactions are approved on a case-by-case basis. The repurchase agreements do not include substantive provisions other than those covenants and other customary provisions contained in standard master repurchase agreements. The repurchase agreements generally require us to transfer additional securities to the counterparty in the event the value of the securities then held by the counterparty in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default in cases where we breach our obligations under the agreement. We receive margin calls from our repurchase agreement counterparties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have maintained sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls, and we have always been able to satisfy a margin call, however, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy requests from our counterparties to post additional collateral in the future. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 If there were an event of default under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty would have the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and make any amount due from us to the counterparty payable immediately. Repurchase obligations are full recourse obligations to us. If we were to default under a repurchase obligation, the counterparty would have recourse to our other assets if the collateral was not sufficient to satisfy the obligation in full. Most of our repurchase agreements are entered into as part of our gestation repo business. 
 
 Our clearing brokers provide securities financing arrangements including margin arrangements and securities borrowing and lending arrangements. These arrangements generally require us to transfer additional securities or cash to the clearing broker in the event the value of the securities then held by the clearing broker in the margin account falls below specified levels and contain events of default in cases where we breach our obligations under such agreements. 
 
 An event of default under the clearing agreement would give our counterparty the option to terminate our clearing arrangement. Any amounts owed to the clearing broker would be immediately due and payable. These obligations are recourse to us. Furthermore, a termination of any of our clearing arrangements would result in a significant disruption to our business and would have a significant negative impact on our dealings and relationship with our customers. 
 
 The following table presents our period end balance, average monthly balance, and maximum balance at any month end during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 for receivables under resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Fluctuations in the balance of our repurchase agreements from period to period and intra-period are dependent on business activity in those periods. The fluctuations in the balances of our receivables under resale agreements over the periods presented were impacted by our clients' desires to execute on balance sheet collateralized financing arrangements. 
 
 Average balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and we consider such intra-period fluctuations as typical for the repurchase market. Month-end balances may be higher or lower than average period balances.

 The junior subordinated notes listed represent debt the Company owes to the two trusts noted above. The total par amount owed by the Company to the trusts is 49,614. However, the Company owns the common stock of the trusts in a total par amount of 1,489. The Company pays interest (and at maturity, principal) to the trusts on the entire 49,614 junior notes outstanding. However, the Company receives back from the trusts the pro rata share of interest and principal on the common stock held by the Company. These trusts are VIEs and the Company does not consolidate them even though the Company holds the common stock. The Company carries the common stock on its balance sheet at a value of 0. The junior subordinated notes are recorded at a discount to par. When factoring in the discount, the yield to maturity of the junior subordinated notes as of September 30, 2024 on a combined basis was 21.05 assuming the variable rate in effect on the last day of the reporting period remains in effect until maturity.

We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and other sources of credit. Due to the uncertainties that exist in the economy, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 The following is a list of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe will have a continuing impact on our financial statements going forward. 
 
 In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement. The ASU applies to the formation of entities that meet the definition of a joint venture (or a corporate joint venture) as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Master Glossary. The amendments in the ASU require that a joint venture apply a new basis of accounting upon formation. As a result, a newly formed joint venture, upon formation, would initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for all joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption of ASU No. 2023-05 is permitted in any interim or annual period in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 , Disclosure Improvements Codification Amendments in Response to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative . These amendments clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of topics and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the SEC s regulations. The ASU will be effective on the date the related disclosure requirements are removed from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K by the SEC and will no longer be effective if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure requirement by June 30, 2027. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are designed to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ). The amendments in this ASU address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards . The ASU provides an illustrative example intended to demonstrate how entities that account for profits interest and similar awards would determine whether a profits interest award should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods with those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements. The ASU amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements. In most instances, the references are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. In other instances, the references were used in prior Statements to provide guidance in certain topical areas. The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our industry is subject to a number of highly complex accounting rules and requirements, many of which place heavy burdens on management to make judgments relating to our business. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements are summarized in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to matters discussed under the heading Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 All amounts in this section are in thousands unless otherwise noted. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk of economic loss arising from the adverse impact of market changes to the market value of our trading and investment positions. Market risk is inherent to both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, and, accordingly, the scope of our market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments. For the purpose of analyzing the components of market risk, we have broken out our investment portfolio into three broad categories, plus debt, as described below. 
 
 Fixed Income Securities : We hold, from time to time, the following securities: U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government agency debt securities, CMOs, non-government MBS, corporate bonds, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred stock, municipal bonds, SBA loans, certificates of deposits, residential mortgage loans, whole loans, and unconsolidated investments in the middle and senior tiers of securitization entities and TruPS. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to market risk by entering into economic hedging transactions, which may include TBAs and other forward agency MBS contracts. The fixed income category can be broadly broken down into two subcategories: fixed rate and floating rate. 
 
 Floating rate securities are not in themselves particularly sensitive to interest rate risk. Because they generally accrue income at a variable rate, the movement in interest rates typically does not impact their fair value. Fluctuations in their current income due to variations in interest rates are generally not material to us. Floating rate fixed income securities are subject to other market risks such as default risk of the underlying issuer, changes in issuer s credit spreads, prepayment rates, investor demand and supply of securities within a particular asset class or industry class of the ultimate obligor. The sensitivity to any individual market risk can be difficult to quantify. 
 
 The fair value of fixed rate securities is sensitive to changes in interest rates. However, fixed rate securities that have low credit ratings or represent junior interests in securitizations are not particularly interest rate sensitive. In general, when we acquire interest rate sensitive securities, we enter into an offsetting short position for a similar fixed rate security. Alternatively, we may enter into other interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate swaps or Eurodollar futures. We measure our net interest rate sensitivity by determining how the fair value of our net interest rate sensitive assets would change as a result of a 100 basis point bps adverse shift across the entire yield curve. Based on this analysis, as of September 30, 2024, we would incur a loss of 1,499 if the yield curve rises 100 bps across all maturities and a gain of 1,496 if the yield curve falls 100 bps across all maturities. 
 
 Equity Securities : We hold equity interests in both public and private entities. These investments are subject to equity price risk. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of underlying equity prices, which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that in turn derive their value from a particular stock. We also hold a significant amount of equity in public companies that recently completed a merger with a SPAC we sponsored or invested in. A significant portion of the equity we hold in these types of entities are subject to sale restrictions. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by closely monitoring those security positions or in some cases entering into derivatives trades to hedge this exposure. We also have had equity investments in entities where the investment is denominated in a foreign currency, or where the investment is denominated in U.S. Dollars but the investee primarily makes investments in foreign currencies. The fair values of these investments are subject to change as the spot foreign exchange rate between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar (our functional currency) fluctuates. We may, from time to time, enter into foreign exchange rate derivatives to hedge all or a portion of this risk. We measure our net equity price sensitivity and foreign currency sensitivity by determining how the net fair value of our equity price sensitive and foreign exchange sensitive assets would change as a result of a 10 adverse change in equity prices or foreign exchange rates. Based on this analysis, as of September 30, 2024, our equity price sensitivity was 1,553 and our foreign exchange currency sensitivity was 0. 
 
 Other Securities: These investments are primarily made up of residual interests in securitization entities. The fair value of these investments will fluctuate over time based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, liquidity of the investment type, the credit performance of the individual assets and issuers within the securitization entity, the asset class of the securitization entity and the relative supply of and demand for investments within that asset class, credit spreads in general, the transparency of valuation of the assets and liabilities of the securitization entity, and investors view of the accuracy of ratings prepared by the independent rating agencies. The sensitivity to any individual market risk cannot be quantified. 
 
 Debt : In addition to the risks noted above, we incur interest rate risk related to our debt obligations. We have debt that accrues interest at either variable rates or fixed rates. As of September 30, 2024, a 100 bps change in the appropriate variable base rate would result in a change in our annual cash paid for interest in the amount of 481. A 100 bps adverse change in the market yield to maturity would result in an increase in the fair value of the debt in the amount of 2,710 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Counterparty Risk and Settlement Risk 
 
 We are subject to counterparty risk primarily in two areas: (i) our collateralized securities transactions described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (ii) our TBA and other forward agency MBS activities described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. With respect to the gestation repo financing activities, our risk is that the counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to repurchase the underlying security when it is due. In this case, we would typically liquidate the underlying security, which may result in a loss if the security has declined in value in relation to the balance due from the counterparty under the reverse repurchase agreement. 
 
 With respect to our TBA and other forward agency MBS activities, our risk is that the counterparty does not settle the TBA trade on the scheduled settlement date. In this case, we would have to execute the trade, which may result in a loss based on market movement in the value of the underlying trade between its initial trade date and its settlement date (which in the case of TBAs can be as long as 90 days). If we were to incur a loss under either of these activities, we have recourse to the counterparty pursuant to the underlying agreements. 
 
 Finally, we have general settlement risk in all of our regular way fixed income and equity trading activities. If a counterparty fails to settle a trade, we may incur a loss in closing out the position and would be forced to try to recover this loss from the counterparty. If the counterparty has become insolvent or does not have sufficient liquid assets to reimburse us for the loss, we may not get reimbursed.

Table of Contents 

How we manage these risks 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 We seek to manage our market risk by utilizing our underwriting and credit analysis processes that are performed in advance of acquiring any investment. In addition, we continually monitor our investments on a daily basis. We perform an in-depth monthly analysis on all our investments and our risk committee meets on a weekly basis to review specific issues within our portfolio and to make recommendations for dealing with these issues. In addition, our broker-dealer has an assigned chief risk officer that reviews the firm s positions and trading activities on a daily basis. 
 
 Counterparty Risk and Settlement Risk 
 
 We seek to manage our counterparty risk primarily through two processes. First, we perform a credit assessment of each counterparty to ensure the counterparty has sufficient equity, liquidity, and profitability to support the level of trading or lending we plan to do with them. Second, we may require counterparties to post cash or other liquid collateral margin to support changes in the market value of the underlying securities or trades on an ongoing basis. 
 
 In the case of collateralized securities financing transactions, we will generally lend less than the market value of the underlying security initially. The difference between the amount lent and the value of the security is referred to as the haircut. We will seek to maintain this haircut while the loan is outstanding. If the value of the security declines, we will require the counterparty to post margin to offset this decline. If the counterparty fails to post margin, we will sell the underlying security. The haircut serves as a buffer against market movements to prevent or minimize a loss. 
 
 In the case of TBA and other forward agency MBS activities, we sometimes require counterparties to post margin with us when the market value of the underlying TBA trade declines. If the counterparty fails to post margin, we will close out the underlying trade. In the case of TBA and other forward agency MBS activities, we will sometimes obtain initial margin or a cash deposit from the counterparty, which serves a purpose similar to the haircut as an additional buffer against losses. However, some of our TBA and other forward agency MBS activities are done without initial margin or cash deposits. 
 
 Risks Related to our Gestation Repo Business 
 
 We have entered into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as part of our gestation repo business. In general, we will lend money to a counterparty after obtaining collateral securities from that counterparty pursuant to a reverse repurchase agreement. We will borrow money from another counterparty using those same collateral securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement. We seek to earn net interest income on these matched transactions. 
 
 In our gestation repo business, we will generally ensure that the maturity dates of our reverse repurchase agreements match the maturity dates of the matched repurchase agreements. Because our maturities are matched, we can pass along any changes in funding terms imposed upon us by our repurchase agreement counterparty to our reverse repurchase agreement counterparty. Therefore, we are not exposed to a great deal of interest rate or funding risk. The main risk we are exposed to is credit risk. We manage this risk by obtaining collateral in excess of the contractual repo balance and performing credit reviews of counterparties and updating them on a routine basis. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company (and its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who certify our financial reports, and to other members of senior management and the Company s board of directors. Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 One of our subsidiary investment advisers, Cohen Company Financial Management LLC ("CCFM"), is currently subject to an investigation by the SEC s enforcement division, which is reviewing its disclosure practices around conflicts of interest and other issues. As is our current practice, we are cooperating with the SEC staff and are in the process of responding to their requests for information. We cannot predict the outcome of this investigation. The costs related to responding to and cooperating with the SEC staff may be material and could continue to be material at least through the completion of the SEC investigation. 
 
 Incorporated by reference to the headings titled Commitments and Contingencies in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in our other reports and periodic filings with the SEC, including without limitation the risk factors contained under the caption Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in that Form 10-K do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. There have been no material changes in the significant factors that may affect our business and operations as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of the Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT and, therefore, is not required to make any dividends or other distributions to its stockholders. However, the Company s board of directors has the power to decide to increase, reduce, or eliminate dividends in the future. The Company s board of directors decision will depend on a variety of factors, including business, financial, and regulatory considerations as well as any limitations under Maryland law or imposed by any agreements governing indebtedness of the Company. There can be no assurances that such dividends will be maintained or increased and, if maintained or increased, will not subsequently be discontinued. 
 
 Certain subsidiaries of the Operating LLC have restrictions on the withdrawal of capital and otherwise in making distributions and loans. JVB is subject to net capital restrictions imposed by the SEC and FINRA that require certain minimum levels of net capital to remain in this subsidiary. In addition, these restrictions could potentially impose notice requirements or limit our ability to withdraw capital above the required minimum amounts (excess capital) whether through distribution or loan. CCFESA is regulated by the ACPR in France and must maintain certain minimum levels of capital. See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
