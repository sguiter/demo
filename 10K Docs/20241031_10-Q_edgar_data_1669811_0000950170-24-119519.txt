 Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries DFIN or the Company has made forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the Company. Generally, forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future actions, events, or results of operations of the Company. These statements may include words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, projects, forecasts, intends, plans, continues, believes, may, will, goals and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including those factors discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1A.

These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 the volatility of the global economy and financial markets, and its impact on transactional volume; 

failure to offer high quality customer support and services; 

the retention of existing, and continued attraction of additional clients; 

failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems, software and solutions as a result of a material breach of security or other performance issues; 

the growth of new technologies and changes in client demands, to which the Company may not be able to adequately adapt; 

the Company s inability to maintain client referrals; 

the competitive market for the Company s products, clients budgetary constraints and industry fragmentation affecting prices; 

the ability to gain client acceptance of the Company s new products and technologies; 

failure of disaster recovery and business continuity plans to adequately respond to a material disruptive event; 

undetected errors or failures found in the Company s services and products could tie-up customer support resources or delay market acceptance of the Company s services and products; 

the retention of existing, and continued attraction of key employees, including management; 

failure to properly use and protect client and employee information and data; 

the effect of availability, quality, security or other performance issues of any of the Company s or third-party systems or services; 

factors that affect client demand, including changes in economic conditions and national or international regulations; 

the Company s ability to access debt and the capital markets due to adverse credit market conditions; 

the effect of increasing costs of providing healthcare and other benefits to employees; 

changes in the availability or costs of key materials (such as ink and paper); 

failure to protect the Company s proprietary technology; 

ability to maintain the Company s brands and reputation; 

funding obligations arising from multiemployer pension plans obligations of the Company s former affiliates; 

the effects of operating in international markets, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

the effect of economic and political conditions, including global health crises and geopolitical instability, on a regional, national or international basis. 

Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this document or the date of any document that may be incorporated by reference into this document.

Pension Plan Termination In August 2024, the Company executed an amendment to allow for the termination of the Company s frozen primary defined benefit plan (the Plan ). The Plan s benefit obligation is expected to be settled by offering lump sum distributions to participants, followed by the purchase of annuity contracts to transfer the Plan s remaining obligation to a third party. As settlement of the obligation will be funded with Plan assets, the Company expects to make a cash contribution to fully fund the Plan in 2025. The cash contribution amount will depend upon the nature and timing of participant lump sum settlements and prevailing market conditions. Pension settlement charges related to the Plan termination, which include the recognition of Plan losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are currently expected to occur in the second half of 2025. The Plan termination is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory review, and the Company has the ability to change the effective date of the termination or revoke the decision to terminate the Plan.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 As used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A ), unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, the Company or DFIN refer to Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. MD A should be read together with the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto, as well as the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024 (the Annual Report ). 
 Company Overview 
 DFIN is a leading global provider of innovative software and technology-enabled financial regulatory and compliance solutions. The Company provides regulatory filing and deal solutions via its software, technology-enabled services and print and distribution solutions to public and private companies, mutual funds and other regulated investment firms, to serve its clients regulatory and compliance needs. DFIN helps its clients comply with applicable regulations where and how they want to work in a digital world, providing numerous solutions tailored to each client s precise needs. The prevailing trend is toward clients choosing to utilize the Company s software solutions, in conjunction with its tech-enabled services, to meet their document and filing needs, while at the same time shifting away from physical print and distribution of documents, except for when it is still regulatorily required or requested by investors. 
 The Company serves its clients regulatory and compliance needs throughout their respective life cycles. For its capital markets clients, the Company offers solutions that allow companies to comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations and support their corporate financial transactions and regulatory/financial reporting through the use of digital document creation and online content management tools; filing agent services, where applicable; solutions to facilitate clients communications with their investors; and virtual data rooms and other deal management solutions. For investment companies, including mutual fund, insurance-investment and alternative investment companies, the Company provides solutions for creating, compiling and filing regulatory communications as well as solutions for investors designed to improve the access to and accuracy of their investment information. 
 Technological advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving workflow preferences have led to the Company s clients managing more of the financial disclosure process themselves, changing the marketplace for the Company s services and products. DFIN s strategy in its Software Solutions segments (CM-SS and IC-SS, as defined below) aligns with the changing marketplace by focusing the Company s investments and resources in its advanced software solutions, primarily ActiveDisclosure ActiveDisclosure ), Arc Suite software platform Arc Suite and Venue Virtual Data Room Venue ), while making targeted investments to further enhance product features. In its Compliance Communications Management segments (CM-CCM and IC-CCM, as defined below), the Company s strategy focuses on maintaining its market-leading position by offering a high-touch, service-oriented experience, using its unique combination of tech-enabled services and print and distribution capabilities. 
 Market Volatility/Cyclicality and Seasonality 
 The Company s Capital Markets segments (CM-SS and CM-CCM), in particular, are subject to market volatility, as the demand for the transactional and Venue offerings is largely dependent on the global market for initial public offerings IPOs ), secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions M A ), public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts, special purpose acquisition company SPAC and de-SPAC transactions and other similar transactions. A variety of factors impact the global markets for transactions, including economic activity levels, interest rates, market volatility, the regulatory and political environment, geopolitical and civil unrest and global pandemics, among others. Due to the significant net sales and profitability derived from transactional and Venue offerings, market volatility can lead to uneven financial performance when comparing to previous periods. U.S. IPOs, M A transactions and public debt offerings were also previously disrupted by U.S. federal government shutdowns, and any future government shutdowns could result in additional volatility. The Company s compliance offerings, supporting the quarterly and annual public company reporting processes through its filing services and ActiveDisclosure, as well as its Investment Companies segments (IC-SS and IC-CCM) regulatory and stockholder communications offerings, including Arc Suite, are less impacted by market volatility. The Company's overall risk profile is balanced by offering services in higher demand during a down market, such as document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process and by moving upstream in the filing process with products like Venue. 
 24 

The quarterly/annual public company reporting cycle subjects the Company to filing seasonality which peaks shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter. Additionally, investment companies clients financial and regulatory reporting requirements include filings for mutual funds on a semi-annual basis as well as annual prospectus filings, which peaks during the second fiscal quarter. The seasonality and associated operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff and outsourcing production for a number of services. ActiveDisclosure and Arc Suite provide clients and their financial advisors software solutions which allow them to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies reducing the need for additional service support during peak periods. The Company remains focused on driving annual recurring revenue to mitigate the impact of market volatility on its financial results. 
 Services and Products 
 The Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its software solutions, tech-enabled services and print and distribution offerings. The Company s software solutions consist of ActiveDisclosure, Arc Suite and Venue. The Company s tech-enabled services offerings consist of document composition, compliance-related SEC Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval EDGAR filing services and transactional solutions. The Company s print and distribution offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping. 
 Government Regulations and Regulatory Impact 
 The SEC is adopting new as well as amending existing rules and forms to enhance the security and modernize the reporting and disclosure of information under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). As the scope and complexity of the regulatory environment continues to increase, regulators are also demanding a greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies disclosures, more summary documents and layered website disclosures. These actions are driving significant changes which impact the Company s customers, and have enabled the Company to offer new value-added functionality and services and accelerate its transition from print and distribution to software solutions. 
 Segments 
 The Company s four operating and reportable segments are: Capital Markets Software Solutions CM-SS ), Capital Markets Compliance and Communications Management CM-CCM ), Investment Companies Software Solutions IC-SS and Investment Companies Compliance and Communications Management IC-CCM ).

In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefits plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits plans expense (income) as well as share-based compensation expense, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments.

 The effective income tax rate was 43.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 29.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA ), provide useful information about the Company s operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company s financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company s core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as historic cost and age of assets, restructuring, impairment and other charges, net, non-income tax, net, gain on investments in equity securities as well as other items, as described below, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with GAAP and has important limitations as an analytical tool. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. In addition to the factors listed above, share-based compensation expense is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to certain of the Company s employees, business performance is evaluated excluding share-based compensation expense. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of grants, share-based compensation expense may vary but will recur in future periods. 
 The following table reconciles net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its investors. Cash and cash equivalents on hand, operating cash flows and the Company s Revolving Facility are the primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company s debt obligations, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth, share repurchases and continuous operational improvements. 
 The Company maintains cash pooling structures that enable participating international locations to draw on the pools cash resources to meet local liquidity needs. Foreign cash balances may be loaned from certain cash pools to U.S. operating entities on a temporary basis in order to reduce the Company s short-term borrowing costs or for other purposes. The Company has the ability to repatriate foreign cash, associated with foreign earnings previously subjected to U.S. tax, with minimal additional tax consequences. The Company maintains its assertion of indefinite reinvestment on all foreign earnings and other outside basis differences to indicate that the Company remains indefinitely reinvested in operations outside of the U.S., with the exception of the previously taxed foreign earnings already subject to U.S. tax. The Company repatriated excess cash at its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not repatriate excess cash at its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company is evaluating whether to make any cash repatriations in the future. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s OECD current project, widely known as Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, seeks to address tax challenges arising in the global economy by introducing a global minimum corporate tax of 15 , referred to as Pillar Two, and several mechanisms to ensure tax is paid (the GloBE Model Rules ). Policymakers across jurisdictions have begun adopting the GloBE Model Rules to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . The OECD continues to release administrative guidance and many countries in which the Company operates have adopted or have proposed legislation to adopt Pillar Two. Many aspects of the minimum tax directive became effective beginning in 2024, with certain additional impacts coming into effect beginning in 2025 and beyond. The Company is monitoring enacted legislation and effective dates in its jurisdictions of operations. The Pillar Two framework did not have a material impact on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the Company does not expect enacted legislation to have a material impact in future periods. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 33.6 million at September 30, 2024, which included 3.1 million in the U.S. and 30.5 million at international locations. 
 The following table describes the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 Operating cash inflows and outflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company s services and products as well as recurring expenditures for labor, rent and other operating activities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 114.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 49.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a favorable change to accrued liabilities and other, an increase in net earnings and a favorable change to accounts payable. Accrued liabilities and other increased operating cash flows by 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to decreasing operating cash flows by 22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in estimated commission payments as a result of higher 2024 software solutions net sales, lower consulting costs associated with Company process improvements and higher expected incentive compensation payments. Accounts payable had no impact to operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to decreasing operating cash flows by 13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the timing of supplier payments. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of 50.8 million of capital expenditures, substantially all related to investments in software development, partially offset by 12.4 million of proceeds from the sale of land. The Company currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately 65 million to 70 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 33.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of 43.0 million of capital expenditures, substantially all related to investments in software development, partially offset by 9.9 million of proceeds from the sales of investments in equity securities. 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 65.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 159.5 million of proceeds from the Revolving Facility borrowings, offset by 159.5 million of payments on the Revolving Facility borrowings.

 Net cash used in financing activities was 38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made payments of 221.5 million on the Revolving Facility borrowings, partially offset by 218.0 million of proceeds from the Revolving Facility borrowings.

Credit Agreement On May 27, 2021, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement dated as of September 30, 2016 (as in effect prior to such amendment and restatement, the Credit Agreement, and the Credit Agreement, as so amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, to, among other things, provide for a 200.0 million delayed-draw term loan A facility (the Term Loan A Facility (bearing interest at a rate equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.00 to 2.50 based upon the Company's Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio), extend the maturity of the 300.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility to May 27, 2026 and modify the financial maintenance and negative covenants in the Credit Agreement. 
 36 

On May 11, 2023, the Company entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to change the reference rate from LIBOR, which ceased being published on June 30, 2023, to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for both the Term Loan A Facility and the Revolving Facility. The SOFR interest rate was effective for the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan A on May 30, 2023 and June 12, 2023, respectively. No other significant terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were amended. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants, including a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to 20.0 million in the aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan A Facility is due and payable in full on May 27, 2026. Voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan A Facility are permitted at any time without premium or penalty. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility, however, the Company had 2.5 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, of which 1.0 million of the outstanding letters of credit reduced the availability under the Revolving Facility. Based on the Company s results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and existing debt, the Company would have had the ability to utilize the remaining 299.0 million of the Revolving Facility and not have been in violation of the terms of the agreement. 
 The current availability under the Revolving Facility and net available liquidity as of September 30, 2024 are shown in the table below:

The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expects to remain in compliance based on management s estimates of operating and financial results for fiscal year 2024 and the foreseeable future. However, declines in market and economic conditions or demand for certain of the Company s services and products could impact the Company s ability to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in future periods. 
 The failure of a financial institution supporting the Revolving Facility would reduce the size of the Company s committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Facility is supported by fifteen U.S. and international financial institutions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company met all the conditions required to borrow under the Revolving Facility, and management expects the Company to continue to meet the applicable borrowing conditions.
