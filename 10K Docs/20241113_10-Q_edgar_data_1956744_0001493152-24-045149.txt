SRM Inc and SRM Ltd are collectively referred to as the Company or SRM. 

On
December 9, 2022, we entered into a stock exchange agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Jupiter Wellness, Inc. Jupiter to govern the separation of our business from Jupiter. On May 26, 2023, we amended and restated the Exchange Agreement (the Share
Exchange to include additional information regarding the distribution and the separation of our business from Jupiter. The separation
as set forth in the Share Exchange with Jupiter closed August 14, 2023. Pursuant to the Share Exchange, on May 31, 2023, we issued 
shares of our Common Stock (representing of our outstanding shares of Common Stock) to Jupiter in exchange for ordinary shares
of SRM Ltd (representing all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of SRM Ltd). 

The
Company s principal business is the design, manufacture, and sale of toys to premier theme parks. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Business 

The
Company is a trusted toy and souvenir designer and developer, selling into the world s largest theme parks and entertainment venues. 

Our
business is built on the principle that almost everyone is a fan of something and the evolution of pop culture is leading to increasing
opportunities for fan loyalty. We create whimsical, fun and unique products that enable fans to express their affinity for their favorite
 something whether it is a movie, TV show, favorite celebrity, or favorite restaurant. We infuse our distinct designs
and aesthetic sensibility into a wide variety of product categories, including figures, plush, accessories, apparel, and homewares. With
our unique style, expertise in pop culture, broad product distribution and highly accessible price points, we have developed a passionate
following for our products that has underpinned our growth. We believe we sit at the nexus of pop culture content providers value
us for our broad network of retail customers, retailers value us for our portfolio of pop culture products and pop culture insights,
and consumers value us for our distinct, stylized products and the content they represent. 

Pop
culture pervades modern life and almost everyone is a fan of something. Today, more quality content is available and technology innovation
has made content accessible anytime, anywhere. As a result, the breadth and depth of pop culture fandom resembles, and in many cases
exceeds, the type of fandom previously associated only with sports. Everyday interactions at home, work or with friends are increasingly
influenced by pop culture. 

We
have invested strategically in our relationships with key constituents in pop culture. Content providers value us for our broad network
of retail customers and retailers value us for our pop culture products, pop culture insights and ability to drive consumer traffic.
Consumers, who value us for our distinct, stylized products, remain at the center of everything we do.

1,500,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (valued at 0.762 per share); and (iii)

Content
Providers : We have licensing relationships with many established content providers, and our products appear in venues
such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Universal Studios, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Herschend Family Entertainment and Merlin Entertainment.
We currently have licenses with Smurfs, The ICEE Company and Zoonicorn LLC, from which we can create multiple products based on each
character within. Content providers trust us to design, create and manufacture unique, stylized extensions of their intellectual property
that extend the relevance of their content with consumers through ongoing engagement, helping to maximize the lifetime value of their
content. 

Consumers :
Fans are increasingly looking for ways to express their affinity for and engage with their favorite pop culture content. Over time, many
of our consumers evolve from occasional buyers to more frequent purchasers, whom we categorize as enthusiasts or collectors. We create
innovative products to appeal to a broad array of fans across consumer demographic groups men, women, boys and girls not
a single, narrow demographic. We currently offer an array of products that sell across several categories. Our products are generally
priced between 2.50 and 50.00, which allows our diverse consumer base to express their fandom frequently and impulsively. We continue
to introduce innovative products designed to facilitate fan engagement at different price points and styles. 

We
have developed a nimble and low-fixed cost production model. The strength of our management team and relationships with content providers,
retailers and third-party manufacturers allows us to move from product concept to a new product tactfully. As a result, we can dynamically
manage our business to balance current content releases and pop culture trends with timeless content based on classic movies, such as
Harry Potter or Star Wars. This has allowed us to deliver significant growth while lessening our dependence on individual content releases.

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

The
Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage
of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth
companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Significant
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are
based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.
We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these
policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and equivalents for purposes
of the statement of cash flows. There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Net
Loss per Common Share 

Net
income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments such
as options, warrants, convertible securities and preferred stock, unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share.
As such, options, warrants, convertible securities and preferred stock are not considered in the calculations, as the impact of the potential
common shares would be to decrease the loss per share.

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company generates its revenue from the sale of its products directly to the end user or distributor (collectively the customer ). 

The
Company recognizes revenues by applying the following steps in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods
or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to
be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: 

identify
 the contract with a customer; 

identify
 the performance obligations in the contract; 

determine
 the transaction price; 

allocate
 the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognize
 revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company s performance obligations are satisfied when goods or products are shipped on an FOB shipping point basis as title passes
when shipped. Our product is generally paid in advance of shipment or standard net 30 days and we offer no specific right of return,
refund or warranty related to our products except for cases of defective products of which there have been none to date. 

Inventory 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs
or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold.
Inventory is based upon the average cost method of accounting. 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ASC 740 ). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and
for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation
allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC
740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
period, disclosure and transition. Based on our evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions
requiring recognition in our financial statements. Since we were incorporated on October 24, 2018, the evaluation was performed for 2018
tax year, which would be the only period subject to examination. We believe that our income tax positions and deductions would be sustained
on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position. Our policy for recording
interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. 

The
Company s deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of net operating loss carry forwards calculated
using effective tax rates (20.6 average of China and US rates) equating to approximately 1,177,676 and 497,655 respectively, less
a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately 1,177,676 and 497,655, respectively. Because of the Company s lack of earnings
history, the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Revenues
and Cost of Sales 

The
Company had sales of 876,392 and 1,128,062 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in sales is due to
declines in attendance at our customers theme parks. Gross margins were slightly higher at 22.4 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 versus 20.3 for September 30, 2023.

 2,279, (v) general and administrative expenses of 476,499 and (vi) no stock based compensation. The decrease in expenses is a
result of the initial costs of going public in the third quarter of 2023 which were greater than the increased
investors relation costs of being a public company.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company s desired disclosure control
objectives. In designing periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company s certifying officers have
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching that level of assurance. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified
in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during the three and nine months ended March
31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. The Company s management believes that a control system, no matter how
well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal
control system are met, and no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation
in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuers and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected.
