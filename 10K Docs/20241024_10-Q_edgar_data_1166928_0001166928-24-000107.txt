 If the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the security is written down to fair value through income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also determined that no individual securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. The Company concluded that the unrealized losses were primarily attributable to increases in market interest rates since these securities were purchased and other market conditions. Accrued interest receivable is not included in available-for-sale security balances and is presented in the "Accrued interest receivable" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest receivable on securities was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. There were loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 Based upon its ongoing assessment of credit quality within the loan portfolio, the Company maintains a Watch List, which includes loans classified as Doubtful, Substandard and Watch according to the Company's classification criteria. These loans involve the anticipated potential for payment defaults or collateral inadequacies. A loan on the Watch List is analyzed individually to categorize the loan to the appropriate credit risk category. 
 
 All loans are subject to the assessment of a credit quality indicator. Risk ratings are assigned for each loan at the time of approval, and they change as circumstances dictate during the term of the loan. The Company utilizes a 9-point risk rating scale as shown below, with ratings 1 - 5 included in the Pass column, rating 6 included in the Watch column, ratings 7 - 8 included in the Substandard column and rating 9 included in the Doubtful column. 
 
 Risk rating 1: The loan is secured by cash equivalent collateral. 
 
 Risk rating 2: The loan is secured by properly margined marketable securities, bonds or cash surrender value of life insurance. 
 
 Risk rating 3: The borrower is in strong financial condition and has strong debt service capacity. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends of the borrower exceed industry statistics. 
 
 Risk rating 4: The borrower's financial condition is satisfactory and stable. The borrower has satisfactory debt service capacity, and the loan is well secured. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends fall in line with industry statistics. 
 
 Risk rating 5: The borrower's financial condition is less than satisfactory. The loan is still generally paying as agreed, but strained cash flows may cause some slowness in payments. The collateral values adequately preclude loss on the loan. Financial characteristics and trends lag industry statistics. There may be noncompliance with loan covenants. 
 
 Risk rating 6: The borrower's financial condition is deficient. Payment delinquencies may be more common. Collateral values still protect from loss, but margins are narrow. The loan may be reliant on secondary sources of repayment, including liquidation of collateral and guarantor support. 
 
 Risk rating 7: The loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The Company is inadequately protected by the valuation or paying capacity of the collateral pledged. If deficiencies are not corrected, there is a distinct possibility that a loss will be sustained. 
 
 Risk rating 8: All the characteristics of rating 7 exist with the added condition that the loan is past due more than 90 days or there is reason to believe the Company will not receive its principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement. 
 
 Risk rating 9: All the weaknesses inherent in risk ratings 7 and 8 exist with the added condition that collection or liquidation, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, is highly questionable and improbable. A loan reaching this category would most likely be charged off.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures 
 
 The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company's allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in the "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in the "Credit loss expense" line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. There was a negative provision for credit losses of for off-balance-sheet credit exposures during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of that hedge the interest payments of rolling one-month funding consisting of FHLB advances or brokered deposits. An additional forward starting swap with a total notional amount of has a starting date in November 2024, replacing a maturing swap in the rolling funding program. Also, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of that effectively convert variable-rate long-term debt to fixed-rate debt and swaps with a total notional amount of that hedge the interest payments of certain deposit accounts. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges: To accommodate customer needs, the Company on occasion offers loan level interest rate swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a swap counterparty (back-to-back swap program). The interest rate swaps are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value. The Company enters into a floating-rate loan and a fixed-rate swap with our customer. Simultaneously, the Company enters into an offsetting fixed-rate swap with a swap counterparty. In connection with each swap transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay a swap counterparty the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. These transactions allow the Company s customers to effectively convert variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans. The customer accommodations and any offsetting swaps are treated as non-hedging derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting.

reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to decrease interest expense through the 12 months ending September 30, 2025 related to cash flow hedges. 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by interest rate swap counterparties, which is minimized by collateral-pledging provisions in the agreements. Derivative contracts with swap counterparties are executed with a Credit Support Annex, which is a bilateral ratings-sensitive agreement that requires collateral postings at established credit threshold levels. These agreements protect the interests of the Company and its counterparties should either party suffer a credit rating deterioration. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company pledged and , respectively, of collateral to the counterparties in the form of cash on deposit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's counterparties pledged and , respectively, of collateral to the Company in the form of cash on deposit.

 There were transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Securities available for sale: When available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of securities (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar bonds where a price for the identical bond is not observable (Level 2). The fair values of these securities are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curves, credit spreads, prices from market makers and live trading systems. 
 
 Management obtains the fair value of securities at the end of each reporting period via a third-party pricing service. Management reviewed the valuation process used by the third party and believed the process was valid. On a quarterly basis, management corroborates the fair values of securities by obtaining pricing from an independent financial market data vendor and comparing the two sets of fair values. Any significant variances are reviewed and investigated. For a sample of securities, prices are further validated by management by obtaining details of the inputs used by the pricing service. Those inputs were independently tested, and management concluded the fair values were consistent with GAAP requirements and the securities were properly classified in the fair value hierarchy.

"SAFE HARBOR" CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to the Company s business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words believes, expects, intends, anticipates, projects, future, confident, may, should, will, strategy, plan, opportunity, will be, will likely result, will continue or similar references, or references to estimates, predictions or future events. Such forward-looking statements are based upon certain underlying assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Because of the possibility that the underlying assumptions are incorrect or do not materialize as expected in the future, actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may affect future results include: interest rate risk, including the effects of changes in interest rates; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our investment portfolio, including as a result of rising interest rates; competitive pressures, including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions, "fintech" companies and digital asset service providers; pricing pressures on loans and deposits; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk; changes in credit and other risks posed by the Company s loan portfolio, including declines in commercial or residential real estate values or changes in the allowance for credit losses dictated by new market conditions, accounting standards or regulatory requirements; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits; changes in local, national and international economic conditions, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of recent developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, limitations and costs, including in response to the recent bank failures; changes in customers acceptance of the Company s products and services; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our or our third-party partners' information security controls or cyber-security related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving the Company; the monetary, trade and other regulatory policies of the U.S. government; acts of war or terrorism, including the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events; risks related to climate change and the negative impact it may have on our customers and their business; changes to U.S. tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; talent and labor shortages; and any other risks described in the Risk Factors sections of this and other reports filed by the Company with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such forward-looking statements to reflect current or future events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that management believes involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments and have the greatest effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations are described as critical accounting policies in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2023.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 This report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company s presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, and the presentation of the efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis, excluding certain income and expenses. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company s financial performance. These measures are considered standard measures of comparison within the banking industry. Additionally, management believes providing measures on a FTE basis enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company s GAAP results for the periods indicated. 
 
 The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on a FTE basis and efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis to their most directly comparable measures under GAAP.

 (1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 percent, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the financial results, as it enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources. 
 (2) The efficiency ratio expresses noninterest expense as a percent of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, excluding specific noninterest income and expenses. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the Company's financial performance. It is a standard measure of comparison within the banking industry. A lower ratio is more desirable.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion describes the consolidated operations and financial condition of the Company, West Bank and West Bank's special purpose subsidiaries (which are invested in new markets tax credit activities). Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the results for the same periods in 2023, and the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024 is compared to that as of December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. 
 
 The Company conducts business from its headquarters building in West Des Moines, Iowa and through its branch offices in central Iowa, which is generally the greater Des Moines metropolitan area; eastern Iowa, which is the area including and surrounding Iowa City and Coralville; and southern Minnesota, which includes the cities of Rochester, Owatonna, Mankato and St. Cloud. 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5,952, or 0.35 per diluted common share, compared to 5,906, or 0.35 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.60 percent and 10.41 percent, respectively, compared to 0.64 percent and 10.89 percent, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,326, or 8.0 percent, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in interest income on loans and decrease in interest expense on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on deposits. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 463 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to 431 in loan swap fees earned during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense increased 987 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment, technology and software expense and FDIC insurance, partially offset by a decrease in business development expenses. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16,953, or 1.00 per diluted common share, compared to 19,612, or 1.17 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.59 percent and 10.18 percent, respectively, compared to 0.72 percent and 12.22 percent, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined 730, or 1.4 percent, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in interest expense on deposits, resulting from rising short-term interest rates and changes in deposit mix, partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 1,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to loan swap fees and a nonrecurring gain from bank-owned life insurance in 2023. Noninterest expense increased 1,504 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment, technology and software expense and FDIC insurance, partially offset by a decrease in business development expenses. 
 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of 1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 200 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses recorded in 2024 was due to changes in the forecasted loss rates, driven by increases in the forecasted unemployment rates. The Company also recorded a negative provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for unfunded commitments recorded in 2024 was due to the decrease in balances of unfunded commitments resulting primarily from the funding of construction loans.

 (in thousands, except share and per share data) 

 Total loans outstanding increased 93,686, or 3.2 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong, as evidenced by the Company's ratio of nonperforming loans to total assets of 0.01 percent as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 0.97 percent of total outstanding loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of that date. 
 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company compares three key performance metrics to those of our identified peer group. The peer group for 2024 consists of 21 Midwestern, publicly traded financial institutions, including Bank First Corporation, Bridgewater Bancshares Inc., ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc., Civista Bancshares, Inc., CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., Equity Bancshares, Inc., Farmers National Banc Corp., Farmers Merchants Bancorp., First Business Financial Services, Inc., First Financial Corp., First Mid Bancshares, Inc., German American Bancorp, Inc., HBT Financial Inc., Hills Bancorporation, Isabella Bank Corporation, LCNB Corp., Mercantile Bank Corporation, MidWest One Financial Group, Inc., Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., Peoples Bancorp, Inc., and Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. The Company is in the middle of the group in terms of asset size. The Company's goal is to perform at or near the top of this peer group relative to what we consider to be three key metrics: return on average equity, efficiency ratio and nonperforming assets to total assets. We believe these measures encompass the factors that define the performance of a community bank. Company and peer results for the key financial performance measures are summarized below.

 The Company's largest component of net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans and securities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the average balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates. Interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by competitive factors, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds interest rate by a total of 425 basis points in 2022 and an additional 100 basis points in 2023. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds interest rate by 50 basis points. The timing and extent of additional interest rate reductions is not known at this time. 
 
 Net interest margin on a FTE basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a measure of the net return on interest-earning assets and is computed by dividing annualized tax-equivalent net interest income by total average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 1.91 percent, while the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 17 basis points, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Tax-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,242 when compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased 960 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Tax-equivalent interest income on loans increased 5,702 and 19,585 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in interest income on loans was driven by a combination of an increase in the average balance of loans and an increase in loan yields. The average balance of loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 178,059 and 197,591, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, while loan yields increased 46 and 54 basis points, respectively, during these periods. Higher market interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 have resulted in higher rates on variable-rate loans and loan originations and renewals compared to current portfolio rates. The yield on the Company's loan portfolio is affected by the portfolio's loan mix, the interest rate environment, the effects of competition, the level of nonaccrual loans and reversals of previously accrued interest on charged-off loans. The yield on the loan portfolio is expected to increase in flat and rising rate environments as variable-rate loans reprice at higher rates and renewals and new originations are priced at prevailing market rates, which exceed the roll-off rate of principal repayments on existing loans. In a declining rate environment, the yield on variable-rate loans will decline, however as long as market rates remain higher than the yield on the fixed rate portfolio, renewals and originations will continue to increase the yield on the fixed-rate portfolio. The political and economic environments can also influence the volume of new loan originations and the mix of variable-rate versus fixed-rate loans. 
 
 The average balance of deposits increased 537,065 and 360,488 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The rate paid on deposits increased 70 and 89 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the cost of deposits was primarily due to increases in deposit interest rates in response to increases in the target federal funds rate that occurred in 2023, the inverted yield curve, increased competition for deposit balances, and changes in deposit mix. 
 
 Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased 2,726 and 948 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of borrowed funds decreased 231,834 and 44,483 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings decreased 239,933 and 105,868 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to increases in deposits. The average rate paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings increased 56 and 76 basis points in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in average rates paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings was driven by the higher federal funds rate in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances increased by 65,989 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in average balances was primarily due to an increase in rolling one-month FHLB advances that are hedged with long-term interest rate swap agreements to provide fixed cost wholesale funding.

 Credit Loss Expense and the Related Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The credit loss expense recorded on the income statement represents a charge made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by the Board of Directors. The allowance for credit losses is management's estimate of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company recorded a credit loss expense for loans of 1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a credit loss expense for loans of 200 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The credit loss expense for loans in 2024 was primarily due to the changes in the forecasted loss rates due to increases in forecasted unemployment rates. Additionally, the Company recorded a negative credit loss expense of 1,000 related to unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in the balance of unfunded commitments resulting primarily from the funding of construction loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of that date. 
 
 Factors management considers in establishing an appropriate allowance include: the borrower's financial condition; the value and adequacy of loan collateral; the condition of the local economy and the borrower's specific industry; the levels and trends of loans by segment; and a review of delinquent and classified loans. The quarterly evaluation of the allowance focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews, changes in the components of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions, and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the customer's cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan; delinquency status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the suspension of interest accrual; or other factors, including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted. The Company's concentration risks include geographic concentrations in central and eastern Iowa and southern Minnesota. The local economies in those markets are composed primarily of major financial service companies, healthcare providers, educational institutions, technology and agribusiness companies, and state and local governments. 
 
 West Bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans, commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, and construction and land development loans. West Bank's typical commercial borrower is a small- or medium-sized, privately owned business entity. Compared to residential mortgages or consumer loans, commercial loans typically have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers' successful business operations. Commercial loans generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. When the economy turns downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. 
 
 While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances, changes in the overall economy in the markets we currently serve, or later acquired information. Identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility, which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio. In addition, regulatory agencies, as integral parts of their examination processes, periodically review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require West Bank to recognize additional charge-offs or provisions for credit losses based on such agencies' review of information available to them at the time of their examinations.

 West Bank's policy is to charge off loans when, in management's opinion, a loan or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible. Commercially reasonable efforts are made to maximize subsequent recoveries. The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's allowance for credit losses on loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and related ratios.

 Revenue from trust services was higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in one-time estate fees. The gain from bank-owned life insurance that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of a death benefit claim. Loan swap fees in 2023 consisted of fees earned in the back-to-back swap program.

 Occupancy and equipment expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs related to new bank buildings, including the Company's new headquarters building. Technology and software expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the addition of new technology, product updates and information security solutions. FDIC insurance expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in assessment rate. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 1,475 (19.9 percent of pre-tax income) and 4,037 (19.2 percent of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1,445 (19.7 percent of pre-tax income) and 4,576 (18.9 percent of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's consolidated income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate in each period, primarily due to tax-exempt interest income, the tax-exempt increase in cash value of bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt gain from bank-owned life insurance, disallowed interest expense, and state income taxes. The tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were also impacted by year-to-date federal low income housing tax credits and a new markets tax credit of approximately 1,131 and 1,123, respectively.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 The Company had total assets of 3,988,566 as of September 30, 2024, compared to total assets of 3,825,758 as of December 31, 2023. Changes in the balance sheet included increases in interest-bearing cash deposits, loans, premises and equipment and total deposits and decreases in securities available for sale and federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. 
 
 Securities 
 
 Securities available for sale decreased by 26,174 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to calls and principal paydowns on securities since December 31, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized losses on securities. Management concluded unrealized losses in the portfolio as of September 30, 2024 are the result of increases in risk-free market interest rates since the securities were purchased and are not an indication of declining credit quality. Unrealized losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The Company expects the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets to decrease over time as the proceeds from paydowns and maturities may be used for loan growth or repayment of borrowed funds. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 61 percent of the available for sale securities portfolio consisted of government agency guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Management believes these securities have little to no credit risk and provide cash flows for liquidity and repricing opportunities. 
 
 Loans and Nonperforming Assets 
 
 Loans outstanding increased 93,686 from 2,927,535 as of December 31, 2023 to 3,021,221 as of September 30, 2024. Changes in the loan portfolio during the first nine months of 2024 included an increase of 107,039 in construction, land and land development loans and a decrease of 18,710 in commercial loans. 
 
 In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Company exercises heightened risk management practices when non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending exceeds 300 percent of total risk-based capital or construction, land and land development loans exceed 100 percent of total risk-based capital. Although the commercial real estate portfolio exceeded these regulatory guidelines as of September 30, 2024, they were within the Company's established policy limits and management believes that the Company has appropriate risk management policies and procedures to regularly monitor the commercial real estate portfolio. An analysis of the Company's non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2023 was presented in the Company's Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, and the Company has not experienced any material changes to that portfolio since December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table sets forth the amount of nonperforming assets held by the Company and common ratio measurements of those assets as of the dates shown. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Nonaccrual loans 233 296 (63) Loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest Loan restructurings (1) 
 Total nonperforming loans 233 296 (63) Other real estate owned Total nonperforming assets 233 296 (63) Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.01 0.01 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.01 0.01 
 (1) While loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty (loan restructurings) are commonly reported by the industry as nonperforming, those not classified in the nonaccrual category are accruing interest due to payment performance. Loan restructurings on nonaccrual status are categorized as nonaccrual. There were no loan restructurings categorized as nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 Deposits 
 
 Deposits increased 304,774, or 10.2 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. Brokered deposits increased to 425,870 at September 30, 2024, from 305,411 at December 31, 2023. Excluding brokered deposits, deposits increased 184,315, or 6.9 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. Deposit growth included a mix of public funds and commercial and consumer deposits. Deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions and fluctuations in our business customers' own liquidity needs. In particular, significant competition for deposits driven by high interest rate alternatives for depositors has impacted deposit fluctuations and increased our cost of deposits. 
 
 West Bank participates in the IntraFi ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposit network which enables depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage on deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. As of September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured deposits, which excludes deposits in the IntraFi reciprocal network, brokered deposits and public funds protected by state programs, were approximately 27.8 percent of total deposits. 
 
 Borrowed Funds 
 
 Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings decreased from 150,270 at December 31, 2023 to 0 as of September 30, 2024. Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings were reduced during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of the increase in deposits. 
 
 The Company had 315,000 of FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024, 295,000 of which are one-month rolling advances hedged with long-term interest rate swaps. The interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rates on these FHLB advances have maturity dates ranging from November 2024 through June 2029 and fixed rates ranging from 1.69 percent to 4.42 percent. Additionally, the Company has one forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 20,000 and a starting date in November 2024, which replaces a maturing swap. This strategy of hedging short-term rolling funding effectively provides fixed cost wholesale funding through the maturity dates of the various interest rate swaps. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The objectives of liquidity management are to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for profitable business expansion. The Company's principal source of funds is deposits. Other sources include loan principal repayments, proceeds from the maturity and sale of securities, principal payments on amortizing securities, federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB, other wholesale funding and funds provided by operations. Liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long-term basis. Investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand, projected loan and securities maturities and payments, expected deposit flows and the objectives set by the Company's asset-liability management policy. The Company had liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents) of 157,803 as of September 30, 2024 compared with 65,357 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth. Deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions and fluctuations in our business customers' own liquidity needs. The Company utilizes brokered deposits and other wholesale funding to supplement core deposit fluctuations and loan growth. Brokered deposits are obtained through various programs administered by IntraFi , and through other third party brokers. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 425,870 in brokered deposits, which included fixed-rate deposits with terms through February 2029 and variable-rate deposits with terms through September 2025. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, West Bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the FHLB of approximately 628,000, as well as approximately 125,000 through the Federal Reserve discount window and 75,000 through unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks. Net cash from operating activities contributed 29,056 to liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management believed that the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, unencumbered securities, cash flows from operations, and additional borrowing capacity were sufficient to meet our liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company had remaining commitments to invest in qualified affordable housing projects totaling 1,253 and 1,649 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Capital 
 
 The Company's total stockholders' equity increased to 235,353 at September 30, 2024 from 225,043 at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of retained net income and the increase in the market value of our available for sale investment portfolio. While accumulated other comprehensive losses reduce tangible common equity, they have no impact on regulatory capital. At September 30, 2024, the Company's tangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets was 5.90 percent compared to 5.88 percent as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company and West Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements (as shown in the following table) can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators, which, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and West Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and West Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Management believed the Company and West Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject as of September 30, 2024.

 The Company and West Bank are subject to a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a capital conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At September 30, 2024, the capital ratios for the Company and West Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking. Interest rate risk refers to the exposure arising from changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a significant impact not only upon net income, but also upon the cash flows and market values of assets and liabilities. Our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk. 
 
 The Company s objectives are to manage interest rate risk to foster consistent growth of earnings and capital. It is our policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products. To measure that risk, the Company uses an earnings simulation approach. 
 
 The Company has an Asset Liability Committee which meets quarterly to review the interest rate sensitivity position and to review and develop various strategies for managing interest rate risk. Measuring and maintaining interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs with the objective of maximizing net interest margin while maintaining interest rate risk within acceptable tolerances. This process relies primarily on the simulation of net interest income over multiple interest rate scenarios. The Company engages a third party that utilizes a modeling program to measure the Company s exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income. The simulations allow for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies. The modeled scenarios begin with a base case in which rates are unchanged and include parallel and nonparallel rate shocks. The model includes deposit beta assumptions which are estimates of changes in interest-bearing deposit pricing for a given change in market interest rates. The results of the rate shocks are measured in two forms: first, the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames; and second, the impact on the market value of equity. The results of the simulation are compared against approved policy limits. 
 
 The following table presents the estimated change in net interest income over a one year time horizon under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown. The changes in each interest rate scenario represents the difference between estimated net interest income in the unchanged interest rate scenario, or the base case, and the estimated net interest income in each of the alternative interest rate scenarios. The net interest income in each scenario is based on immediate parallel yield curve changes in the interest rates applied to a static balance sheet. This analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. 
 At September 30, 2024 Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Over One Year Horizon Change in Interest Rates Change Change 300 basis points rising (9,941) (11.65) 200 basis points rising (6,583) (7.71) 100 basis points rising (3,480) (4.08) 100 basis points falling 3,303 3.87 200 basis points falling 5,427 6.36 300 basis points falling 6,536 7.66 
 
 Computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions. The assumptions used in our interest rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from those projections set forth above due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and customer behavior. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates.
