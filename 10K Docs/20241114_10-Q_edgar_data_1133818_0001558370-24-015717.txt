 BIO-PATH HOLDINGS, INC. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Unless the context requires otherwise, references in these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to we, our, us, the Company and Bio-Path refer to Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary. Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bio-Path, Inc., is sometimes referred to herein as Bio-Path Subsidiary. The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The unaudited quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Therefore, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future in connection with its ongoing activities, including conducting clinical trials, manufacturing development and seeking regulatory approval of its drug candidates, prexigebersen, BP1002, BP1003 and BP-1001A. Accordingly, the Company will continue to require substantial additional capital to fund its projected operating requirements. Such additional capital may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to the Company. In addition, the Company may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if it believes it has sufficient funds for its current and future operating plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of securities in the future. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, the Company may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. million as of December 31, 2023 pursuant to drug supply contracts for the manufacture and delivery of prexigebersen for testing in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

Overview We are a clinical and preclinical stage oncology-focused RNAi nanoparticle drug development company utilizing a novel technology that achieves systemic delivery for target-specific protein inhibition for any gene product that is over-expressed in disease. Our drug delivery and antisense technology, called DNAbilize , is a platform that uses P-ethoxy, which is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) backbone modification that is intended to protect the DNA from destruction by the body s enzymes when circulating in vivo, incorporated inside of a lipid bilayer having neutral charge. We believe this combination allows for high efficiency loading of antisense DNA into non-toxic, cell-membrane-like structures for delivery of the antisense drug substance into cells. In vivo, the DNAbilize delivered antisense drug substances are systemically distributed throughout the body to allow for reduction or elimination of target proteins in blood diseases and solid tumors. Through testing in numerous animal studies and dosing in clinical trials, our DNAbilize drug candidates have demonstrated an excellent safety profile. DNAbilize is a registered trademark of the Company. Using DNAbilize as a platform for drug development and manufacturing, we currently have four drug candidates in development to treat at least five different cancer disease indications. Our lead drug candidate, prexigebersen (pronounced prex i je ber sen), which targets growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 Grb2 ), initially started the efficacy portion of a Phase 2 clinical trial for untreated acute myeloid leukemia AML patients in combination with low-dose cytarabine LDAC ). The interim data presented in the 2018 American Society of Hematology ASH Annual Meeting showed that 11 (65 of the 17 evaluable patients had a response, including five (29 who achieved complete remission CR ), inclusive of one CR with incomplete hematologic recovery CRi and one morphologic leukemia-free state, and six (35 stable disease responses, including two patients who had greater than a 50 reduction in bone marrow blasts. However, DNA hypomethylating agents are now the most frequently used agents in the treatment of elderly AML patients in the U.S. and Europe. As a result, Stage 2 of the Phase 2 trial in AML was amended to remove the combination treatment of prexigebersen and LDAC and replace it with the combination treatment of prexigebersen and decitabine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, for treatment of a second cohort of untreated AML patients. Since decitabine is also used as a treatment for relapsed/refractory AML patients, a cohort of relapsed/refractory AML patients was also added to the study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA granted approval of venetoclax in combination with LDAC, decitabine or azacytidine (the latter two drugs are DNA hypomethylating agents) as frontline therapy for newly diagnosed AML in adults who are 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities precluding intensive induction chemotherapy. We believe this approval of the frontline venetoclax and decitabine combination therapy provides an opportunity for combining prexigebersen with the combination therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients. Preclinical efficacy studies for the triple combination treatment of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax in AML have been successfully completed. In the preclinical efficacy studies, four AML cancer cell lines were treated with three different combinations of decitabine, venetoclax and prexigebersen. Decrease in AML cell viability was the primary measure of efficacy. The triple combination of decitabine, venetoclax and prexigebersen showed significant improvement in efficacy in three of the four AML cell lines. Based on these results, we believe that adding prexigebersen to the treatment combination of decitabine and venetoclax could lead to improved efficacy in AML patients. Accordingly, we further amended Stage 2 of this Phase 2 clinical trial to add the triple combination treatment comprised of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. Our approved amended Stage 2 for this Phase 2 clinical trial currently has three cohorts of patients. The first two cohorts will treat patients with the triple combination of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. The first cohort will include newly diagnosed

 AML patients, and the second cohort will include relapsed/refractory AML patients. Finally, the third cohort will treat relapsed/refractory AML patients, who are venetoclax-resistant or -intolerant, with the two-drug combination of prexigebersen and decitabine. The full trial design plans have approximately 98 evaluable patients for the first cohort having newly diagnosed AML patients with a preliminary review performed after 19 evaluable patients and a formal interim analysis after 38 evaluable patients. The full trial design plans have approximately 54 evaluable patients for each of the second cohort, having relapsed/refractory AML patients, and the third cohort, having AML patients who are venetoclax-resistant or -intolerant, in each case with a review performed after 19 evaluable patients. The study is anticipated to be conducted at up to ten clinical sites in the U.S., and Gail J. Roboz, MD, is the national coordinating Principal Investigator for the Phase 2 trial. Dr. Roboz is a professor of medicine and director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University (the Weill Medical College and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. On August 13, 2020, we announced the enrollment and dosing of the first patient in this approved amended Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. The safety run-in of Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical study was successfully completed, and the preliminary data was presented at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting. In the safety run-in of the triple combination, six evaluable patients were treated with the combination of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. These patients included four relapsed/refractory AML patients, and two newly diagnosed AML patients. Five patients (83 responded to treatment, including four (67 achieving CR/CRi/MLFS and one (17 achieving partial remission PR ). Recent publications provide that response (CR + CRi) rates to combination treatment with decitabine and venetoclax (but without prexigebersen) are 12 to 52 for relapsed/refractory AML patients, depending on the length of treatment (12 for patients treated with venetoclax in combination with decitabine for five days and 42 to 52 for patients treated with venetoclax in combination with decitabine for 10 days), and 0 to 39 for relapsed/refractory secondary AML patients. Response rates to frontline treatment with decitabine and venetoclax (but without prexigebersen) are 54 to 74 for newly diagnosed AML patients. These preliminary data showed the treatment was well-tolerated and there were no dose limiting toxicities attributed to prexigebersen. Three patients remained on treatment for more than one cycle. On August 1, 2023, we announced interim data for the first two cohorts of the amended Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. Fourteen newly diagnosed patients were evaluable in the first cohort and treated with at least one cycle of the prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax combination therapy. All patients in the first cohort (median age 75) were adverse risk by 2017 European LeukemiaNet ELN guidelines (n=10) or secondary AML (n=4). Prexigebersen was well-tolerated, and adverse events AEs were generally consistent with decitabine and venetoclax treatment and/or for AML. Twelve of the 14 evaluable patients (86 achieved CR/CRi and two (14 achieved PR. In total, 100 of the evaluable patients had a response to treatment. The CR/CRi rate of 86 for the evaluable patients in the first cohort is significantly higher than the range of CR/CRi rates of 54 to 74 for newly diagnosed patients treated with the frontline combination treatment of decitabine and venetoclax from the publications described above. Fourteen refractory/relapsed evaluable AML patients in the second cohort were treated with at least one cycle of the prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax combination therapy. Substantially all of the patients in the second cohort (median age 56.5) were adverse risk by 2017 ELN guidelines (n=11) or secondary AML (n=2). Prexigebersen was well-tolerated, and AEs were generally consistent with decitabine and venetoclax treatment and/or for AML. Eight of the 14 evaluable refractory/relapsed patients (57 achieved CR/CRi, two (14 achieved PR and two (22 achieved stable disease. In total, 93 of the evaluable patients in the second cohort had a response to treatment. The CR/CRi rate of 57 for the evaluable refractory and relapsed patients in the second cohort is significantly higher than the range of CR/CRi rates of 12 to 52 for refractory/relapsed patients treated with the combination treatment of decitabine and venetoclax from the publications described above. On June 3, 2024, we announced additional interim data for the first two cohorts of the amended Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. In Cohort 1, 31 newly diagnosed patients were enrolled; 20 evaluable patients with a median age of 75 years, treated with at least one cycle of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax, had adverse-risk or secondary AML evolved from myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or treatment-related AML. Fifteen patients (75 achieved complete remission, CR with partial recovery of peripheral blood counts CRh ), or CRi. Two patients achieved PR and two patients achieved stable disease. In Cohort 2, 38 relapsed/refractory patients were enrolled; 23 evaluable patients with a median age of 63 years, treated with at least one cycle of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax, had adverse-risk or secondary AML. Twelve patients (55 achieved CR/CRi/CRh, one patient achieved PR, eight patients achieved stable disease and one patient had treatment failure. Among the evaluable patients of both cohorts, adverse events were consistent with those expected with decitabine and venetoclax and/or AML, including fatigue (72 ), anemia (60 and neutropenia (49 ), while the most frequent severe adverse events were febrile neutropenia (26 and sepsis (5 ). The interim analysis data was selected as an oral presentation in the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO Annual Meeting and as a poster presentation in the 2024 European Hematology Association EHA Annual Meeting. Based on this interim data, we expect to continue enrollment of up to 98 and 54 evaluable patients for Cohorts 1 and

 2, respectively and plan to pursue FDA expedited programs for Fast Track designation. We are evaluating whether to seek to expand Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe. On July 8, 2024, we announced that the study is currently paused for an interim analysis, amendment preparation and FDA review. We expect to complete enrollment in cohorts 1 and 2 in 2026. Our second drug candidate, Liposomal Bcl-2 BP1002 ), targets the protein Bcl-2, which is responsible for driving cell survival in up to 60 of all cancers. A Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the ability of BP1002 to treat refractory/relapsed lymphoma and refractory/relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL patients has been initiated. The Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted at the Georgia Cancer Center, The University of Texas Southwestern and New York Medical College. On January 10, 2024, we announced the successful completion of the first dose cohort in the Phase 1 clinical trial. A total of six evaluable patients are scheduled to be treated over two dose levels with BP1002 monotherapy in a standard 3+3 design, unless there is a dose limiting toxicity which would require an additional three patients to be tested. There were no dose limiting toxicities in the first dose cohort (20 mg/m 2 ). Enrollment has continued for patients in the second BP1002 dose cohort of 40 mg/m 2 . Additionally, preclinical studies suggest that the combination of BP1002 with decitabine is efficacious in venetoclax-resistant leukemia and lymphoma cells. An abstract of the preclinical study was presented at the 2021 American Association for Cancer Research AACR Annual Meeting. A Phase 1/1b clinical trial to investigate the ability of BP1002 to treat refractory/relapsed AML patients, including venetoclax-resistant patients, is being studied. A recent study found that AML patients who had relapsed from frontline venetoclax-based treatment had a very poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than three months. Since venetoclax and BP1002 utilize different mechanisms of action, we believe that BP1002 may be a potential treatment for venetoclax-relapsed AML patients. The Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at several leading cancer centers in the United States, including the Weill Medical College, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center MD Anderson ), Scripps Health and The University of California at Los Angeles Cancer Center. On December 14, 2023, we announced the successful completion of the first dose cohort of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1002; and on April 18, 2024, we announced the successful completion of the second dose cohort. On October 7, 2024, we announced that the FDA had completed its review of PK/PD data from the first two dosing cohorts and that the enrollment for the third dosing cohort (60 mg/m 2 is now complete. We expect to advance to the next planned higher dose of 90 mg/m 2 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The approved treatment cycle is two doses per week over four weeks, resulting in eight doses administered over twenty-eight days. The Phase 1b portion of the study is expected to commence after completion of BP1002 monotherapy cohorts and will assess the safety and efficacy of BP1002 in combination with decitabine in refractory/relapsed AML patients. Our third drug candidate, Liposomal STAT3 BP1003 ), targets the STAT3 protein and is currently in IND enabling studies as a potential treatment of pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC and AML. Preclinical models have shown BP1003 to inhibit cell viability and STAT3 protein expression in NSCLC and AML cell lines. Further, BP1003 successfully penetrated pancreatic tumors ex vivo and significantly enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine, a treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, in a pancreatic cancer patient derived tumor model. An abstract of the preclinical study was presented at the 2019 AACR Annual Meeting. Our lead indication for BP1003 is pancreatic cancer due to the severity of this disease and the lack of effective, life-extending treatments. For example, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is projected to be the second most lethal cancer behind lung cancer by 2030. Typical survival for a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient is about three to six months from diagnosis. Additionally, an abstract of the preclinical study demonstrating that BP1003 enhanced the sensitivity of breast and ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy was presented at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting. On September 16, 2024, we announced a publication in the peer-reviewed journal, Biomedicines, which highlights the therapeutic potential and broad anti-tumor effect of BP1003 in numerous preclinical solid tumor models, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. We have successfully completed several IND enabling studies of BP1003 and have one additional IND enabling study to complete. Once the additional study is successfully completed, our goal is to file an IND application and initiate the first-in-humans Phase 1 study of BP1003 in patients with refractory, metastatic solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer and NSCLC. In addition, a modified product named BP1001-A, our fourth drug candidate, has shown to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in preclinical solid tumor models. Results of the preclinical study were published in the scientific journal Oncotarget in July 2020. BP1001-A incorporates the same drug substance as prexigebersen but has a slightly modified formulation designed to enhance nanoparticle properties. A BP1001-A Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors has been initiated. The Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at several leading cancer centers in the United States, including MD Anderson, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Mary Crowley Cancer Research and Holy Cross Hospital, Maryland. On July 17, 2023, we announced completion of the first cohort of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. A total of nine evaluable patients are

 scheduled to be treated with BP1001-A monotherapy over three dose levels in a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. The first dose cohort consisted of a starting dose of 60 mg/m 2 , and there were no dose limiting toxicities. Enrollment is now open for patients for the second dose cohort of 90 mg/m 2 which we expect to be complete in the first quarter of 2025 in order to advance to dose level 3. The Phase 1b portion of the study is expected to commence after successful completion of BP1001-A monotherapy cohorts and is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of BP1001-A in combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian or endometrial tumors. Phase 1b studies are also expected to be opened in combination with gemcitabine in Stage 4 pancreatic cancer and combination therapy in breast cancer. Grb2 is involved in activating the RAS/ERK pathway for cell growth. By blocking the cell s ability to produce Grb2, BP1001-A treatment may limit cell growth. In obesity, two such growth pathways are related to leptin and insulin. Activation of leptin or insulin receptors can stimulate the RAS/ERK pathway via Grb2. Developing BP1001-A for the treatment of obesity should have a high probability of success as its mechanism of action has the potential to treat insulin resistance, which is the major contributor to obesity, Type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic diseases. We believe development of BP1001-A for the treatment for obesity and related metabolic diseases could be accelerated given the large amount of safety data from BP1001-A treatment of patients with solid tumors and the continued unmet medical need. The Company is preparing for preclinical development evaluating BP1001-A for the treatment of obesity and will continue thereafter to conduct additional IND-enabling studies with an aim to advance BP1001-A into first-in-human studies in this indication. Our DNAbilize technology-based products are available for out-licensing or partnering. We intend to apply our drug technology template to new disease-causing protein targets to develop new liposomal antisense drug candidates for inclusion in our pipeline that meet scientific, preclinical and commercial criteria and file new patents on these targets. We expect that these efforts will include collaboration with key scientific opinion leaders in the field of study and include developing drug candidates for diseases other than cancer. As we expand our drug development programs, we will look at indications where a systemic delivery is needed and antisense RNAi nanoparticles can be used to slow, reverse or cure a disease, either alone or in combination with another drug. We are developing a molecular biomarker package to accompany prexigebersen treatment, the goal of which is to identify patients with a genetic profile more likely to respond to treatment thereby improving probability of success for this program. The emerging role of biomarkers has been enhancing cancer development over the past decade and has become a more common companion to many cancer development programs. We expect to develop molecular biomarker packages to accompany our new programs. We have certain intellectual property as the basis for our current drug products in clinical development, prexigebersen, BP1002, BP1003 and BP1001-A. We are developing RNAi antisense nanoparticle drug candidates based on our own patented technology to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders where targeting a single protein may be advantageous and result in reduced patient adverse effects as compared to small molecule inhibitors with off-target and non-specific effects. We have composition of matter and method of use intellectual property for the design and manufacture of antisense RNAi nanoparticle drug products. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 114.7 million. Our net loss was 2.1 million and 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net loss was 7.1 million and 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses, and we anticipate that our losses may increase substantially as we expand our drug development programs and commercialization efforts. To achieve profitability, we must enter into license or development agreements with third parties or successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our drug candidates and effectively commercialize any drug candidates we develop. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drug candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue and we may never be able to achieve or sustain profitability. We expect to finance our foreseeable cash requirements through cash on hand, cash from operations, debt financings and public or private equity offerings. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, we may seek collaborations and license arrangements for our drug candidates. We currently have no lines of credit or other arranged access to debt financing.

 Company History and Available Information The Company was incorporated in May 2000 as a Utah corporation. In February 2008, Bio-Path Subsidiary completed a reverse merger with the Company, which at the time was traded over the counter and had no current operations. The prior name of the Company was changed to Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. and the directors and officers of Bio-Path Subsidiary became the directors and officers of Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. On March 10, 2014, our common stock ceased trading on the OTCQX and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol BPTH. Effective December 31, 2014, we changed our state of incorporation from Utah to Delaware through a statutory conversion pursuant to the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our principal executive offices are located at 4710 Bellaire Boulevard, Suite 210, Bellaire, Texas 77401, and our telephone number is (832) 742-1357. On February 22, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20, and our common stock began trading on the spilt-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the commencement of trading on February 23, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, approximately 61,000 shares were added to our total shares outstanding due to rounding fractional shares of common stock up to a whole share of common stock. All common stock share and per share amounts in this Quarterly R eport on Form 10-Q have been adjusted to give effect to the 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There are no recent accounting pronouncements that have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Financial Operations Overview Revenue We have not generated significant revenues to date. Our ability to generate revenues from our drug candidates, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our drug candidates. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, third-party grants, service agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate due to the timing and amount of services performed, milestones achieved, license fees earned and payments received upon the eventual sales of our drug candidates, in the event any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue will be adversely affected. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities, including the development of our drug candidates. Our research and development expenses consist of: expenses related to research and development personnel, including salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical investigative sites, laboratories, manufacturing organizations and consultants; and costs of materials used during research and development activities. 
 Costs and expenses that can be clearly identified as research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Advance payments, including nonrefundable amounts, for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts will be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 services are performed. If the goods will not be delivered, or services will not be rendered, then the capitalized advance payment is charged to expense. We expect research and development expenses associated with the completion of the associated clinical trials to be substantial and to increase over time. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of our drug candidates or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from our drug candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: the rate of progress, results and costs of completion of ongoing clinical trials of our drug candidates; the size, scope, rate of progress, results and costs of completion of any potential future clinical trials and preclinical tests of our drug candidates that we may initiate; competing technological and market developments; the performance of third-party manufacturers and suppliers; the ability of our drug candidates, if they receive regulatory approval, to achieve market success; disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our drug candidates; and the impact, risks and uncertainties related to global pandemics and actions taken by governmental authorities or others in connection therewith. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a drug candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel, professional fees for legal, accounting and other services, travel costs and facility-related costs such as rent, utilities and other general office expenses. Results of Operations Comparisons of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue . We had no revenue for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Research and Development Expense . Our research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million, a decrease of 1.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to decreased manufacturing expenses related to drug product releases as well as a decrease in expense related to our clinical trial for BP1001 in AML due to timing of patient enrollment during the quarter. The following table sets forth our research and development expenses (in thousands):

Net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable periods and excludes stock options and warrants because they are antidilutive. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have not generated significant revenues to date. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our capital stock and other securities. We expect to finance our foreseeable cash requirements through cash on hand, cash from operations, debt financings and public or private equity offerings. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, we may seek collaborations and license arrangements for our drug candidates. We currently have no lines of credit or other arranged access to debt financing. We had a cash balance of 0.6 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.5 million compared to December 31, 2023. We do not believe that our available cash at September 30, 2024, together with the net proceeds received from the October 2024 Private Placement (as defined below) will be sufficient to meet obligations and fund our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining funding through one or more sources as described above to meet its planned obligations and pay its liabilities. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million. Excluding non-cash change in fair value of the warrant liability of 2.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of 0.4 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of 0.1 million, net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of the net loss for the period of 7.1 million, an increase other current assets of 0.4 million and a decrease in lease liabilities of 0.1 million. These are partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1.5 million and a decrease in prepaid drug product of 0.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 9.7 million. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 0.6 and depreciation and amortization expenses of 0.1 million, partially offset by a non-cash decrease in fair value of the warrant liability of 0.1 million, included in net loss, net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of the net loss for the period of 12.7 million, a decrease in operating liabilities of 0.4 million and an increase in other current assets of 0.2 million. These are partially offset by a decrease in prepaid drug product of 3.0 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.7 million from the 2023 Public Offering (as defined below). 2022 Shelf Registration Statement On May 27, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on June 14, 2022 (File No. 333-265282) (the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement ), at which time the offering of unsold securities under a previous shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on June 5, 2019 (File No. 333-231537) (the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement ), was deemed terminated pursuant to Rule 415(a)(6) under the Securities Act. The 2022 Shelf Registration Statement was filed to register the offering, issuance and sale of (i) up to 110.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock or any combination thereof, either individually or in units, (ii) up to 9.0 million of our common stock under our At The Market Offering Agreement (the Offering Agreement ), dated as of July 13, 2020, with H. C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), pursuant to which we could offer and sell, from time to time, through or to Wainwright, shares of our common stock, which 9.0 million was subsequently reduced to 3.0 million pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on July 29, 2022, and (iii) up to 11,895 shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants outstanding on May 27, 2022.

As a result of the termination of the Offering Agreement, we will not offer or sell any additional shares of our common stock thereunder, and the entire 3.0 million of shares of our common stock previously available for sale under the Offering Agreement will be available for sale in other offerings pursuant to the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Because our public float is less than 75.0 million, our ability to offer and sell any securities under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement is currently limited pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3. For so long as our public float is less than 75.0 million, the aggregate market value of securities we sell pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 during any 12 consecutive months may not exceed one-third of our public float. The foregoing does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction. 2023 Public Offering On August 3, 2023, we entered into a placement agency agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC relating to a best efforts public offering of an aggregate of 175,000 shares of our common stock, together with warrants to purchase up to 175,000 shares of our common stock, for gross proceeds of approximately 2.1 million (the 2023 Public Offering ).

Under the At The Market Offering Agreement, Wainwright may sell shares by any method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, as amended, or any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions.

Future Capital Requirements We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, including conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of our drug candidates, prexigebersen, BP1002, BP1003 and BP1001-A. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to fund our projected operating requirements. Such additional capital may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plan. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities in the future. Our future capital requirements may change and will depend on numerous factors, which are discussed in detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. For more information, see Note 1 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States has required our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of the year ended December 31, 2023.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Failure to meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.

In addition, the delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital.
