Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

. On , the Company completed its initial public offering IPO of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company contributed the net proceeds of the IPO to City Office REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ), in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership common units ). 
 The Company s interest in the Operating Partnership entitles the Company to share in distributions from, and allocations of profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to the Company s percentage ownership of common units. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the exclusive power under the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to manage and conduct the Operating Partnership s business, subject to limited approval and voting rights of the limited partners. 

The Company has elected to be taxed and will continue to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Subject to qualification as a REIT, the Company will be permitted to deduct dividend distributions paid to its stockholders, eliminating the U.S. federal taxation of income represented by such distributions at the Company level. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and, for years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax.

On May 15, 2023, the Company consented to the appointment of a receiver to assume possession and control of the 190 Office Center property as a result of an event of default as defined in the property s non-recourse
 loan agreement. Given the appointment of the receiver, the Company assessed whether the entity holding the property should be reassessed for consolidation as a VIE in accordance with ASC 810 Consolidation. 
 Based on its analysis, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore deconsolidated the property as of May 15, 2023. The Company deconsolidated the net carrying value of real estate assets of million, the mortgage loan of million, cash and restricted cash of million and net current liabilities of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a loss on deconsolidation of million, which has been included within net loss on disposition of real estate property on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows.

The Company estimates that the fair value approximates carrying value due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 

With the exception of fixed rate mortgage loans payable, the carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments approximate their fair value. The Company determines the fair value of its fixed rate mortgage loan payable based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate that approximates the current borrowing rates for instruments of similar maturities. Based on this, the Company has determined that the fair value of these instruments was million and million (compared to a carrying value of million and million) as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accordingly, the fair value of mortgage loans payable have been classified as Level 3 fair value measurements.

Under the share repurchase program, the shares may be repurchased from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. 
 Repurchased shares of common stock will be classified as authorized and unissued shares. The Company recognizes the cost of shares of common stock it repurchases, including direct costs incurred, as a reduction in stockholders equity. Such reductions of stockholders equity due to the repurchases of shares of common stock will be applied first, to reduce common stock in the amount of the par value associated with the shares of common stock repurchased and second, to reduce additional paid-in
 capital by the amount that the purchase price for the shares of common stock repurchased exceed the par value.

 Overview 

Company 

We were formed as a Maryland corporation on November 26, 2013. On April 21, 2014, we completed our IPO of shares of common stock. We contributed the net proceeds of the IPO to our Operating Partnership in exchange for common units in our Operating Partnership. Both we and our Operating Partnership commenced operations upon completion of the IPO and certain related formation transactions. 

 Revenue Base 

As of September 30, 2024, we owned 23 properties comprised of 56 office buildings with a total of approximately 5.6 million square feet of net rentable area NRA ). As of September 30, 2024, our properties were approximately 83.4 leased. 

18 

Table of Contents 

 Office Leases 

Historically, most leases for our properties have been on a full-service gross or net lease basis, and we expect to continue to use such leases in the future. A full-service gross lease generally has a base year expense stop, whereby we pay a stated amount of expenses as part of the rent payment while future increases (above the base year stop) in property operating expenses are billed to the tenant based on such tenant s proportionate square footage in the property. The property operating expenses are reflected in operating expenses; however, only the increased property operating expenses above the base year stop recovered from tenants are reflected as tenant recoveries within rental and other revenues on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In a triple net lease, the tenant is typically responsible for all property taxes and operating expenses. As such, the base rent payment does not include any operating expenses, but rather all such expenses are billed to or paid by the tenant. The full amount of the expenses for this lease type is reflected in operating expenses, and the reimbursement is reflected as tenant recoveries. We are also a lessor for a fee simple ground lease at the AmberGlen property. 

 Factors That May Influence Our Operating Results and Financial Condition 

Economic Environment and Inflation 

The broader economy in the U.S. has experienced increased levels of inflation, higher interest rates and tightened monetary and fiscal policies. The banking and lending sector in particular has been impacted by the interest rate environment. Recently, interest rates, monetary policy and inflation have begun to shift towards an improved economic environment. Office capital markets activity continues to be suppressed, largely driven by limited debt availability for the sector. However, it remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent events and any future changes in interest rates or inflation, and this evolving economic environment impacts our operating activities as: 

business leaders may generally become more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as entry into a new lease, given the uncertain economic environment; 

our cost of capital has increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing is significantly more challenging to arrange; and 

retaining and attracting new tenants has become increasingly challenging due to potential business layoffs, downsizing and industry slowdowns. 

Despite the current economic environment, there is increasing evidence that many businesses have or will tighten up in-person
 work policies particularly if economic conditions worsen. Many of these companies increased their workforce beginning in 2020 without increasing their available space. We expect these factors will help offset, at least partially, the headwinds to office space demand. 
 Work-From-Home Trends 

Our business has been and will likely continue to be impacted by tenant uncertainty regarding office space needs given the evolving remote and hybrid working trends. Usage of our assets in the near future depends on corporate and individual decisions regarding return to usage of office space, which is impossible to estimate. As of September 30, 2024, 13.0 of net rentable area under our portfolio was vacant, when excluding committed leases, as compared to 13.7 as of September 30, 2023. 

 Leasing activity has been and is expected to be impacted by the evolving work-from-home trend until and unless tenants increase the utilization of their spaces. We have experienced and we expect that we will continue to experience slower new leasing, and there remains uncertainty over existing tenants long-term space requirements. Overall, this could reduce our anticipated rental revenues. In addition, certain tenants in our markets have and may explore opportunities to sublease all or a portion of their leased square footage to other tenants or third parties. While subleasing generally does not impact the ability to collect payment from the original lessee and will not result in any decrease in the rental revenues expected to be received from the primary tenant, this trend could reduce our ability to lease incremental square footage to new tenants, could increase the square footage of our properties that goes dark, could reduce anticipated rental revenue should tenants determine their long-term needs for square footage are lower than originally anticipated and could impact the pricing and competitiveness for leasing office space in our markets.

 We will continue to actively evaluate business operations and strategies to optimally position ourselves given current economic and industry conditions. 

 Business and Strategy 

We focus on owning and acquiring office properties in our footprint of growth markets predominantly in the Sun Belt. Our markets generally possess growing populations with above-average employment growth forecasts, a large number of government offices, large international, national and regional employers across diversified industries, generally lower-cost centers for business operations and a high quality of life. We believe these characteristics have made our markets desirable, as evidenced by domestic net migration generally towards our geographic footprint. A majority of our properties are well located, have good access and functionality to our markets, are new or in new condition, attract high-quality tenants and are professionally managed. We utilize our management s market-specific knowledge and relationships as well as the expertise of local real estate property and leasing managers to identify acquisition opportunities that we believe will offer cash flow stability and long-term value appreciation. 

 Rental Revenue and Tenant Recoveries 

The amount of net rental revenue generated by our properties will depend principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from lease terminations. As of September 30, 2024, the operating properties in our portfolio were 83.4 leased, with 2.3 of our leases scheduled to expire over the remainder of the calendar year, without regard to renewal options. The amount of rental revenue generated also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. Our leases typically include rent escalation provisions designed to provide annual growth in our rental income as well as an ability to pass through cost escalations to our tenants, and in the normal course of business we do not typically waive these rent escalation provisions. Certain leases contain termination provisions which permit the tenant to terminate the arrangement generally upon payment of a termination fee, which we believe acts as a deterrent to cancelling the lease. These early termination provisions applied to approximately 16.7 of the net rentable area in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024. In 2024, no tenant has exercised an early termination provision. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. We continually monitor our tenants ability to meet their lease obligations to pay us rent to determine if any adjustments should be reflected currently. Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our markets or submarkets or downturns in our tenants industries, including as a result of high interest rates and the fluctuating likelihood of a U.S. recession, that impair our ability to renew or re-let
 space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. In addition, growth in rental revenue will also partially depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria. 
 At the beginning of the year the Company, through wholly owned subsidiaries, was the landlord under leases at three of the Company s properties totaling approximately 177,000 square feet with subsidiaries of WeWork, which had announced that it had entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during the previous year. During the first quarter of 2024, WeWork announced that it rejected the lease at our Block 23 property totaling 46,000 square feet. The Company recorded a termination fee of 0.9 million during the period ended March 31, 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into lease amendments with WeWork at our Bloc 83 and The Terraces properties to reduce WeWork s leased space by a total of 53,000 square feet by the end of 2024. WeWork exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings during the second quarter of 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a lease amendment with WeWork at our Bloc 83 property to renew 28,000 square feet through December 2026. The remaining 78,000 square feet are leased by subsidiaries of WeWork under long-term leases.

(1) 
 Annualized Average Effective Rent accounts for the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, including the amortization of rent escalations and base rent concessions (e.g., free rent abatements) contained in the lease. The square foot result per property is calculated by multiplying (i) Average Effective Rent for the month ended September 30, 2024 by (ii) 12, divided by the occupied square footage in that period. 

(2) 
 Annualized gross rent per square foot includes adjustment for estimated expense reimbursements of triple net leases. 

(3) 
 Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying (i) rental payments (defined as cash rents before abatements) for the month ended September 30, 2024 by (ii) 12. 

(4) 
 Averages weighted based on the property s NRA, adjusted for occupancy. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs. Increases in these expenses over tenants base years (until the base year is reset at expiration) are generally passed along to tenants in our full-service gross leased properties and are generally paid in full by tenants in our net leased properties. 

 Conditions in Our Markets 

Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in the markets we operate in, including state budgetary shortfalls, employment rates, natural hazards and other factors, may impact our overall performance. While we generally expect the trend of positive population and economic growth in our Sun Belt cities to continue, there is no way for us to predict whether these trends will continue, especially in light of inflation and elevated interest rates as well as potential changes in tax policy, fiscal policy and monetary policy. In addition, it is uncertain and impossible to estimate the potential impact that the work-from-home trend will have on the short- and long-term demand for office space in our markets. 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements follow the same policies and procedures as outlined in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Results of Operations 

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Rental and Other Revenues.

Rental and other revenues include net rental income, parking, signage and other income, as well as the recovery of operating costs and property taxes from tenants. Rental and other revenues decreased 1.8 million, or 4 , to 42.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue decreased year over year due to the disposition of Cascade Station in June 2024 which reduced revenue by 1.0 million. Revenue also decreased at Intellicenter and 2525 McKinnon by 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively, due to lower occupancy at the properties compared to the prior year. Lastly, revenue also decreased at Block 23 and The Terraces by 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively, largely due to the write-off
 of straight-line rent associated with the WeWork leases at these two properties. Offsetting these decreases, revenue increased year over year at Mission City and Bloc 83 by 0.3 million and 0.3 million, respectively, due to higher occupancy. The remaining properties rental and other revenues were marginally higher in comparison to the prior year period.

 Operating Expenses 

Total Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses consist of property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses increased 0.3 million, or 1 , to 36.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 35.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total operating expenses at Bloc 83 increased by 0.5 million due to higher property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization associated with higher occupancy. The disposition of Cascade Station in June 2024 decreased total operating expenses by 0.6 million. The remaining properties total operating expenses were marginally higher in comparison to the prior year period. 
 Property Operating Expenses.

Property operating expenses are comprised mainly of building common area and maintenance expenses, insurance, property taxes, property management fees, as well as certain expenses that are not recoverable from tenants, the majority of which are related to costs necessary to maintain the appearance and marketability of vacant space. In the normal course of business, property expenses fluctuate and are impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, occupancy levels, weather, utility costs, repairs, maintenance and re-leasing
 costs. Property operating expenses increased 0.2 million, or 1 , to 17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The disposition of Cascade Station in June 2024 decreased property operating expenses by 0.2 million. The remaining properties property operating expenses were marginally higher in comparison to the prior year period. 
 General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses are comprised of public company reporting costs and the compensation of our management team and Board of Directors, as well as non-cash
 stock-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 0.3 million, or 7 , to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.5 million reported in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses increased due to marginally higher professional fees incurred in the current period. 
 Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.1 million, or 1 , to 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 14.7 million reported for the same period in 2023. The disposition of Cascade Station in June 2024 decreased depreciation and amortization expense by 0.3 million. The remaining properties depreciation expenses were marginally higher in comparison to the prior year period. 
 Other Expense (Income) 

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased 0.4 million, or 6 , to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates. 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Rental and Other Revenues.

Rental and other revenues include net rental income, parking, signage and other income, as well as the recovery of operating costs and property taxes from tenants. Rental and other revenues decreased 5.6 million, or 4 , to 129.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 134.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue decreased year over year due to the dispositions and tenant departures at 190 Office Center in May 2023 and Cascade Station in June 2024, which reduced revenue by 2.3 million and 1.9 million, respectively. Revenue also decreased at 2525 McKinnon, Intellicenter and Superior Pointe by 0.8 million, 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively, due to lower occupancy at the properties compared to the prior year. Lastly, revenue also decreased at The Terraces and Block 23 by 0.7 million and 0.3 million, respectively, largely due to the write-off
 of straight-line rent associated with the WeWork leases at these two properties. Offsetting these decreases, revenue increased year over year at Park Tower, Mission City and Bloc 83 by 0.7 million, 0.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, due to higher occupancy. The remaining properties rental and other revenues were relatively unchanged in comparison to the prior year period. 
 Operating Expenses 

Total Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses consist of property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses decreased 0.6 million, or 1 , to 108.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 109.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The dispositions of 190 Office Center in May 2023 and Cascade Station in June 2024 decreased total operating expenses by 1.9 million and 0.8 million, respectively. Offsetting these decreases, total operating expenses at Bloc 83 increased by 0.9 million due to higher property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization associated with higher occupancy. The remaining properties total operating expenses were 1.2 million higher in comparison to the prior year period, primarily due to inflation.

 Property Operating Expenses.

Property operating expenses are comprised mainly of building common area and maintenance expenses, insurance, property taxes, property management fees, as well as certain expenses that are not recoverable from tenants, the majority of which are related to costs necessary to maintain the appearance and marketability of vacant space. In the normal course of business, property expenses fluctuate and are impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, occupancy levels, weather, utility costs, repairs, maintenance and re-leasing
 costs. Property operating expenses increased 0.4 million, or 1 , to 53.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 52.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Property operating expenses at Bloc 83 increased by 0.8 million primarily due to higher electricity costs and property taxes. Offsetting this increase, the disposition of 190 Office Center in May 2023 decreased property operating expenses by 1.2 million. The remaining properties property operating expenses were 0.8 million higher in comparison to the prior year period, primarily due to inflation. 
 General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses are comprised of public company reporting costs and the compensation of our management team and Board of Directors, as well as non-cash
 stock-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 0.3 million, or 3 , to 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.0 million reported for the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses increased due to marginally higher professional fees and stock-based compensation expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization decreased 1.4 million, or 3 , to 44.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 45.8 million reported for the same period in 2023. The dispositions of 190 Office Center in May 2023 and Cascade Station in June 2024 decreased depreciation and amortization expense by 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The remaining properties depreciation expenses were marginally lower in comparison to the prior year period. 
 Other Expense (Income) 

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased 0.7 million, or 3 , to 25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 24.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates. 
 Net Loss on Disposition of Real Estate Property.

During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an assignment in lieu of foreclosure agreement to transfer possession and control of the Cascade Station property to the lender as a result of an event of default as defined in the property s loan agreement. Given the terms of the assignment in lieu of foreclosure agreement, the Company deconsolidated the entity holding the property and related assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss on deconsolidation of 1.5 million. In the prior year, the Company consented to the appointment of a receiver to assume possession and control of the 190 Office Center property as a result of an event of default as defined in the property s loan agreement. Given the appointment of the receiver, the Company deconsolidated the entity holding the property and related assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a loss on deconsolidation of 0.1 million. 
 Cash Flows 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 43.0 million and 52.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

 Cash flow from operating activities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 1.8 million to 50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in working capital.

 Cash flow to investing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased 1.1 million to 29.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower additions to real estate properties in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash used in investing activities attributable to higher deferred leasing costs in the current year. 
 Cash flow to financing activities. 

Net cash used in financing activities increased 11.3 million to 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net proceeds from borrowings partially offset by lower dividend distributions paid to stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had approximately 25.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and 17.1 million of restricted cash as of September 30, 2024. 

 On March 15, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement for the Unsecured Credit Facility that provided for commitments of up to 250 million, which included an accordion feature that allowed the Company to borrow up to 500 million, subject to customary terms and conditions. On September 27, 2019, the Company entered into a five-year 50 million term loan, increasing its authorized borrowings under the Company s Unsecured Credit Facility from 250 million to 300 million. On November 16, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that increased the total authorized borrowings from 300 million to 350 million. On January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for the Unsecured Credit Facility and entered into a three-year 25 million term loan, increasing its total authorized borrowings from 350 million to 375 million. The Unsecured Credit Facility matures in November 2025 and may be extended 12 months at the Company s option upon meeting certain conditions. On September 27, 2024, the 50 million term loan matured and was repaid with proceeds from the Unsecured Credit Facility, reducing total authorized borrowings from 375 million to 325 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 255.0 million outstanding under our Unsecured Credit Facility and a 2.5 million letter of credit to satisfy escrow requirements for a mortgage lender. 

 On May 23, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan agreement for Central Fairwinds, extending the term for an additional five years and amending the interest rate from fixed to floating. The loan bears interest at a rate equal to the daily-simple SOFR rate plus a margin of 325 basis points. The Company also entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixing the SOFR component of the borrowing rate of the loan at 4.43 . 

 On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into a loan modification and extension agreement for FRP Ingenuity Drive, which among other things, included a principal repayment of 1.6 million and extended the term for an additional two years to December 2026 with a one-year
 extension option. 
 On February 26, 2020, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into equity distribution agreements (collectively, the Agreements with each of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Raymond James Associates, Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, B. Riley FBR, Inc., D.A. Davidson Co. and Janney Montgomery Scott LLC (the Sales Agents pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell from time to time up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the Sales Agents, acting as agents or principals (the ATM Program ). On May 7, 2021 the Company delivered to D.A. Davidson Co. a notice of termination of the Agreement, effective May 7, 2021. The Company did not issue any shares of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock under the ATM Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

 Following changes in property-level occupancy rates, it is possible that we could fail certain financial covenants within certain property-level mortgage borrowings. For mortgages with financial covenants, the lenders remedy of a covenant failure would be a requirement to escrow funds for the purpose of meeting our future debt payment obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the lender for our mortgage borrowings at the SanTan property has elected their right to direct property cash flows into lender-controlled restricted cash accounts to fund property operations until certain thresholds are met. Further, under the terms of the loan modification and extension agreement at the FRP Ingenuity Drive property, signed in the second quarter of 2024, property cash flows from this property will be directed into lender-controlled restricted cash accounts through the maturity of the loan. For these two properties, the total restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million.

 Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and distributions to our stockholders required to qualify for REIT status, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and reserves established from existing cash. We have further sources such as proceeds from our public offerings, including under our ATM Program, and borrowings under our mortgage loans and our Unsecured Credit Facility. 

 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions and non-recurring
 capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring
 capital improvements using our Unsecured Credit Facility pending longer term financing. 
 We believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity securities. However, we cannot assure you that this is or will continue to be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, interest rates, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets is dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us. 

 In addition to the incurrence of debt and the offering of equity securities, dispositions of property may serve as additional capital resources and sources of liquidity. We may recycle capital from stabilized assets or from sales of properties. Capital from these types of transactions is intended to be redeployed into property acquisitions, capital improvements, or to pay down existing debt. 

 Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities

 Contracted interest on the floating rate borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility was calculated based on the balance and interest rate at September 30, 2024. Contracted interest on our loans which we have applied interest rate swaps was calculated based on the swap rate fixing the SOFR component of the borrowing rates. 

Inflation 

Substantially all of our office leases include expense reimbursement provisions that provide for property operating expense escalations. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that expense increases due to inflation may be at least partially offset by these contractual rent increases and expense escalations. However, a longer period of inflation could affect our cash flows or earnings, or impact our borrowings, as discussed elsewhere in this Report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to borrowings. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We have entered, and we will only enter into, contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors. See Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding our derivatives. 

 We currently consider our interest rate exposure to be moderate because as of September 30, 2024, approximately 536.0 million, or 82.3 , of our debt had fixed interest rates, or effectively fixed rates when factoring in interest rate swaps, and 115.0 million, or 17.7 , had variable interest rates. The 536.0 million fixed rate debt includes our loans against which we have applied interest rate swaps. The interest rate swaps effectively fix the SOFR component of the borrowing rates until maturity of the debt. A 1 increase in SOFR would result in a 1.2 million increase to our annual interest costs on debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility. A 1 decrease in SOFR would result in a 1.2 million decrease to our annual interest costs on debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and would increase the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as decrease interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility. 

 Interest rate risk amounts are our management s estimates based on our Company s capital structure and were determined by considering the effect of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment. We may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our Company s financial structure. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 Based on the most recent evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determined that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
 and 15d-15(e)
 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We and our subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to litigation arising from the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, management does not believe that any such litigation will have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
 there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except for those included below. Any of those risk factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Properties 

Real estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us. 

We compete with a large number of property owners, operators and developers, some of whom may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are the quality and age of the property, attractiveness of location and the breadth and the quality of the amenities offered. These factors may negatively impact leasing efforts and lead to higher re-leasing
 costs, as we believe our tenants and prospective new tenants across our portfolio sometimes compare the cost and the value of leasing space in our buildings to the value of newer space with more amenities asking higher rent in other buildings in the market. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties, leasing costs, occupancy rates and our results of operations. 
 Our commercial office properties are located primarily in Sun Belt markets, which generally exhibit positive population and economic growth. The number of competitive office properties in these areas, which may be newer, more amenitized or better located than our properties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease office space at our properties and on the effective rents we are able to charge. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1
 trading arrangement or non-Rule
 10b5-1
 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
