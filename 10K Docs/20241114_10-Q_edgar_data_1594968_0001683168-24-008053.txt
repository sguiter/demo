On June 6, 2022, Ms. Keaveney was compensated

The Company has accumulated net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset future taxable income. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax
asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should
a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

Company in the disposed entity. This transaction does not represent a strategic shift in the Company s operations and, therefore,
is not reported as a discontinued operation. 

Results of Operations 

Introduction 

The financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this report have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company was recently formed and has not established
sufficient operations or revenues to sustain the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The following table provides selected balance
sheet data for our Company at September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023:

To date, the Company has relied on debt and equity
raised in private offerings and shareholder loans to finance operations and no other sources of capital has been identified. If we experience
a shortfall in operating capital, we could be faced with having to limit our research and development activities.

The Company has not generated any revenues from
operations, and may be unable to fund on-going activities. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations.
Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible
delays in developing our own hardware and software, and the possibility of new regulations that will make our company difficult or impossible
to operate. 

If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from
either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. 

If we are unable to complete any phase of our
development program or fail to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full
business plan or we may be forced to cease operations.

to advance the necessary capital to pay the expenses of the Company and there are no formal financing agreements in place. The outstanding

any party. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of results of operations
and financial condition are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to provisions for uncollectible
accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The accounting policies that we follow are set
forth in Note 2 to our financial statements as included in the SEC report filed. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, 
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information in this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level.

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over our financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to management regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

Our management, consisting of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors,
and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design
of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions,
or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management's Assessment Regarding Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the
Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for
accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal control of financial reporting as discussed
below. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) and all related
information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

18 

Management conducted an evaluation of the design
and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on the criteria
in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established. This evaluation
included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness
of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 

While the Company does adhere to internal controls
and processes that were designed, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating
and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties
to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the
deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements
may not be prevented or detected. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

Management has evaluated, and continues to evaluate,
avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal control weaknesses have
been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time. Management expects to
continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that have been and continue
to be in use at the Company. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company s most recent financial quarter that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
