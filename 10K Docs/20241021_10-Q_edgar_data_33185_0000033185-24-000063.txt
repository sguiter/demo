 This report contains information that may constitute forward-looking statements. Generally, the words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, project, will, may and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address future operating performance and events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, including statements relating to future operating results, improvements in our information technology and data security infrastructure, including as a part of our cloud data and technology transformation, our strategy, the expected financial and operational benefits, synergies and growth from our acquisitions, changes in U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates and inflation, that materially impact consumer spending, home prices, investment values, consumer debt, unemployment rates and the demand for Equifax's products and services, our culture, our ability to innovate, the market acceptance of new products and services and similar statements about our business plans are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s historical experience and our present expectations or projections, including without limitation our expectations regarding the Company s outlook, long-term organic and inorganic growth, and customer acceptance of our business solutions referenced below under Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Business Overview.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, based on observable inputs was billion and billion compared to its carrying value of billion for both periods. 
 
 complete any acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we completed acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2023. The values of net assets acquired were recorded at fair value using Level 3 inputs. The majority of the related current assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as of the date of acquisition, as their carrying values approximated their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions were estimated primarily based on the income and cost approaches. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of the cash flows that the assets are expected to generate in the future. We developed internal estimates for the expected cash flows and discount rates in the present value calculations. The cost approach estimates fair value based on determining the amount of money required to replace the asset with another asset with equivalent utility or future service capability.

 As of September 30, 2024, these assets were million, with a corresponding balance in other current liabilities. These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements.

The carrying value of the investment was adjusted to million as of the closing date, based on quoted market prices, resulting in a loss of million and a gain of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which was recorded in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in addition to the BVS activity mentioned above, we sold our interest in a separate equity investment. The overall sale proceeds exceeded the total carrying value of the investments, and we recorded a gain of million in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, these funds were million. These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements.

 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived reacquired rights representing the value of rights which we had granted to various affiliate credit reporting agencies that were reacquired in the U.S. and Canada. At the time we acquired these agreements, they were considered perpetual in nature under the accounting guidance in place at that time and, therefore, the useful lives are considered indefinite. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We are required to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value. We perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset annual impairment test as of December 1. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying amounts did not change during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Purchased Intangible Assets. Purchased intangible assets represent the estimated acquisition date fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business. Purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer and commercial data files acquired through our acquisitions of various companies, including a fraud and identity solutions provider and independent credit reporting agencies in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada and Dominican Republic. We expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred. We amortize all of our purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis. For additional information about the useful lives related to our purchased intangible assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Senior Notes. In August 2024, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of five -year Senior Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes") in an underwritten public offering. Interest on the 2029 Notes accrues at a rate of per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the sale of the 2029 Notes were ultimately used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under our delayed draw term loan (the "Term Loan") which was due in August 2026. We must comply with various non-financial covenants, including certain limitations on mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions, as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The 2029 Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
 
 Senior Credit Facility. We have access to a billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ), which matures in August 2027. In March 2023, we amended the Revolver (as well as our then-outstanding Term Loan) to adjust our debt covenant requirements and incorporate the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) into our agreement, among other changes. Borrowings under the Revolver may be used for working capital, for capital expenditures, to refinance existing debt, to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The Revolver includes an option to request a maximum of extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the closing date of the Revolver. In May 2024, we exercised our first option to extend the maturity date by , from August 2026 to August 
 18 

outstanding CP notes, million of letters of credit outstanding, and outstanding borrowings under the Revolver. Availability under the Revolver was million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial Paper Program. Our billion CP program has been established through the private placement of CP notes from time-to-time, in which borrowings may bear interest at either a variable or a fixed rate, plus the applicable margin. Maturities of CP can range from overnight to days. Because the CP is backstopped by our Revolver, the amount of CP which may be issued under the program is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued and by the outstanding borrowings under our Revolver. At September 30, 2024, there were outstanding CP notes. We have disclosed the net short-term borrowing activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were no CP borrowings or payments with a maturity date greater than days and less than days for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

or less. We may issue other guarantees in the ordinary course of business. The maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at September 30, 2024. We have agreed to guarantee the liabilities and performance obligations (some of which have limitations) of a certain debt collections and recovery management subsidiary under its commercial agreements. 
 
 Many of our commercial agreements contain commercially standard indemnification obligations related to tort, material breach or other liabilities that arise during the course of performance under the agreement. These indemnification obligations are typically mutual. 
 
 We are the lessee under many real estate leases. It is common in these commercial lease transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort, environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct. 
 
 Certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations. In certain of these credit agreements, we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. lenders to withholding taxes. 
 
 In conjunction with certain transactions, such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business, or the disposition of certain assets or businesses, we sometimes provide routine indemnifications, the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited. 
 
 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings. The Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations. 
 
 We cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the guarantees and indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 In addition to the matters set forth above, we are involved in legal and regulatory matters, government investigations, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available. We have recorded accruals in our Consolidated Financial Statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. While it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated for certain of these matters, it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible losses that might result from their resolution. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. 
 
 For additional information about these and other commitments and contingencies, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Effective Tax Rate 
 
 Our effective income tax rate was for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the write off in the third quarter of 2023 of a deferred tax liability related to our original investment in BVS which was no longer necessary given the acquisition of BVS in August 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Equifax Inc. MD A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. This section discusses the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented. 
 
 As used herein, the terms Equifax, the Company, we, our and us refer to Equifax Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Equifax Inc. 
 
 All references to earnings per share data in MD A are to diluted earnings per share, or EPS, unless otherwise noted. Diluted EPS is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. 
 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 
 Equifax Inc. is a global data, analytics and technology company. We provide information solutions for businesses, governments and consumers, and we provide human resources business process automation and outsourcing services for employers. We have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, government agencies and individuals. Our services are based on comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments, employment, income, educational history, criminal justice data, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions, demographic and marketing data. We use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making and process automation solutions and processing services for our clients. We are a leading provider of information and solutions used in payroll-related and human resource management business process services in the U.S. as well as e-commerce fraud and charge back protection services in North America. For consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions. Additionally, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. 
 
 We currently operate in four global regions: North America (U.S. and Canada), Asia Pacific (Australia, New Zealand and India), Europe (the U.K., Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). We maintain support operations in Chile, Costa Rica, India and Ireland. We also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. 
 
 Recent Events and Company Outlook 
 As further described in our 2023 Form 10-K, we operate in the U.S., which represented 77 of our revenue in 2023, and internationally in 20 countries. Our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services, mortgage, talent solutions, federal, state and local governments, automotive, telecommunications, e-commerce and many others. 
 Demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit and small business commercial credit decisioning and portfolio review, marketing, identity validation and fraud protection activity, employee hiring and onboarding activity, and activity in provisioning support services in the U.S. by government agencies. Demand is also enhanced by our initiatives to expand our products, capabilities and markets served. 
 
 For 2024, we expect that U.S. economic activity, as measured by GDP, will grow but at a slower rate of growth than experienced in 2023. Our forecast assumes the U.S. mortgage market, as measured by credit inquiries, is expected to decline by about 7 in 2024 versus 2023. The U.S. mortgage market, particularly the mortgage refinance portion of the U.S. mortgage market, can be significantly impacted by U.S. interest rates which impact mortgage rates available to consumers. In Australia, the U.K., Canada, and Brazil, our forecast assumes economic activity, as measured by GDP, to grow in 2024 but at slower rates than in 2023.

Segment and Geographic Information 
 Segments. The Workforce Solutions segment consists of the Verification Services and Employer Services business lines. Verification Services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification, as well as criminal justice data. Employer Services revenue is derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. These services include unemployment claims management, I-9 and onboarding services, Affordable Care Act compliance management, tax credits and incentives and other complementary employment-based transaction services. Workforce Solutions has established operations in Canada, Australia and the U.K. 
 
 The USIS segment consists of three service lines: Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions, and Financial Marketing Services. Online Information Solutions and Mortgage Solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection, modeling services and consumer credit monitoring services. USIS also markets certain decisioning services which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. Online Information Solutions also includes our U.S. consumer credit monitoring solutions business. Financial Marketing Services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross-selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. 
 
 The International segment consists of Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada and Latin America. Canada s services are similar to our USIS offerings. Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America are made up of varying mixes of service lines that are generally consistent with those in our USIS reportable segment. We also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process. 
 
 Geographic Information. We currently have operations in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, the U.K., Uruguay and the U.S. We also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore. Approximately 76 of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Approximately 76 and 77 of our revenue was generated in the U.S. during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Seasonality. We experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. Revenue generated by the online consumer information services component of our USIS operating segment is typically the lowest during the first quarter, when consumer lending activity is at a seasonal low. Revenue generated from the Employer Services business unit within the Workforce Solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of 1095-C services that occur in the first quarter each year. Revenue generated from our financial wealth asset products and data management services in our Financial Marketing Services business is generally higher in the fourth quarter each year due to the significant portion of our annual renewals and deliveries which occur then. Mortgage related revenue is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year due to the increase in consumer home purchasing during the summer in the U.S. Any change in the U.S. mortgage market has a corresponding impact on revenue and operating profit for our business within the Workforce Solutions and USIS operating segments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 Consolidated Financial Results 
 
 Operating Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Consolidated Operating Revenue 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) (In millions) Workforce Solutions 620.0 577.2 42.8 7 1,835.6 1,756.3 79.3 5 U.S. Information Solutions 476.9 426.0 50.9 12 1,420.5 1,292.7 127.8 10 International 344.9 315.9 29.0 9 1,005.6 889.7 115.9 13 Consolidated operating revenue 1,441.8 1,319.1 122.7 9 4,261.7 3,938.7 323.0 8 
 
 Revenue increased by 122.7 million, or 9 , and 323.0 million, or 8 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Total revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates, which decreased revenue by 26.7 million, or 2 , and 79.0 million, or 2 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Revenue in both periods increased due to growth in USIS, International, and Workforce Solutions. USIS revenue growth in both periods is primarily due to growth in mortgage related online services. International revenue growth for both periods is driven by growth in Latin America from the Boa Vista Servi os S.A. ("BVS") acquisition, completed in August 2023, as well as local currency growth in Argentina and growth in Europe. Workforce Solutions revenue growth for both periods is primarily due to growth in Verification Services, partially offset by declines in Employer Services. 
 
 Operating Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Consolidated Operating Expenses 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) (In millions) Consolidated cost of services 645.2 585.2 60.0 10 1,903.7 1,753.5 150.2 9 Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 380.4 333.1 47.3 14 1,105.7 1,042.3 63.4 6 Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 169.1 154.4 14.7 10 498.3 454.4 43.9 10 Consolidated operating expenses 1,194.7 1,072.7 122.0 11 3,507.7 3,250.2 257.5 8 
 
 Cost of services increased 60.0 million and 150.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in both periods is primarily due to higher royalty and revenue share costs. The increase in the first nine months is also due to costs from BVS, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on costs of services led to a decrease of 6.1 million and 21.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 47.3 million and 63.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the third quarter is due to an increase in people costs primarily due to restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by decreased litigation expense from an accrual in the third quarter of 2023 for a penalty associated with resolution of the investigation of the 2017 cybersecurity incident by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("U.K. FCA") that did not recur in the same period of 2024. The increase in the first nine months is primarily due to increased people costs and costs from BVS which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023. The increased people costs for the first nine months, excluding the impact of costs from BVS, is primarily due to higher restructuring charges and incentive plan costs. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates led to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of 8.8 million and 29.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 27 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 14.7 million and 43.9 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for both periods is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs from technology transformation capital spending incurred previously. The increase in the first nine months is also due to higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the BVS acquisition. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 0.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 1.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Operating Income and Operating Margin Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Consolidated Operating Income 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) (In millions) Consolidated operating revenue 1,441.8 1,319.1 122.7 9 4,261.7 3,938.7 323.0 8 Consolidated operating expenses 1,194.7 1,072.7 122.0 11 3,507.7 3,250.2 257.5 8 Consolidated operating income 247.1 246.4 0.7 754.0 688.5 65.5 10 Consolidated operating margin 17.1 18.7 (1.6) pts 17.7 17.5 0.2 pts 
 
 Total company operating margin decreased by 1.6 percentage points and increased by 0.2 percentage points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The margin decrease for the third quarter is due to increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher reported revenue. The margin increase for the first nine months is due to the aforementioned higher reported revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses and amortization expenses during the period. 
 
 Interest Expense and Other Income, net Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Consolidated Interest Expense and Other Income, net

 Interest expense decreased by 6.5 million and 7.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for both periods is due to lower debt balances in 2024 when compared to the same periods of 2023 due to repayments of commercial paper during 2024. The decrease for the third quarter is also due to a lower weighted average cost of debt when compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other income, net, decreased by 4.1 million and 23.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and in the first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the third quarter is primarily due to lower interest income from investments and a loss on foreign currency transactions. The decrease for the first nine months is primarily due to the gain on fair market value adjustment of our investment in BVS due to our acquisition of BVS in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in the same period of 2024, as well as the sale of an investment in 2023 that did not recur in 2024 and a loss on foreign currency transactions.

 Our effective income tax rate was 26.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 25.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the write off in the third quarter of 2023 of a deferred tax liability related to our original investment in BVS which was no longer necessary given the acquisition of BVS in August 2023.

 Consolidated net income decreased by 21.6 million and increased by 16.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the third quarter is primarily due to higher income tax expense. The increase in the first nine months is due to higher levels of operating income, partially offset by higher income tax expense and lower levels of other income, net.

Workforce Solutions revenue increased by 7 and 5 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in revenue for the third quarter is due to an increase in both non-mortgage and mortgage verticals within Verification Services. The increase for the first nine months is due to an increase in non-mortgage verticals within Verification Services, partially offset by declines in mortgage revenue. The increase for both periods is partially offset by declines in Employer Services. 
 
 Verification Services 
 
 Revenue increased by 14 and 9 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in revenue for both periods is primarily due to growth in the government and talent verticals. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 is partially offset by declines in the mortgage vertical. 
 
 Employer Services 
 
 Revenue decreased by 19 and 13 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in revenue for both periods is primarily due to lower Employee Retention Credit ("ERC") revenue and declines in I-9 and onboarding services. The ERC revenue decrease is driven by the wind down of the program, accelerated by the IRS pausing new claims processing during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Workforce Solutions Operating Margin 
 
 Operating margin increased to 43.2 for the third quarter of 2024 from 41.8 for the third quarter of 2023, and increased to 43.3 for the first nine months of 2024 from 41.8 for the first nine months of 2023. The increased margin for both periods is due to the aforementioned increase in revenue.

 USIS revenue increased by 12 and 10 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for both periods is due to growth in mortgage related online services, as well as growth in Mortgage Solutions, consumer solutions revenue, and Financial Marketing Services. Growth in mortgage related online services and Mortgage Solutions is due to both product pricing as well as higher mortgage credit inquiries. 
 
 Online Information Solutions 
 
 Revenue increased by 9 for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for both periods is driven by higher mortgage related online services due to product pricing and higher mortgage credit inquiries, as well as continued growth of consumer solutions revenue. 
 
 Mortgage Solutions 
 
 Revenue increased by 39 and 28 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in both periods is due to both product pricing and higher mortgage credit inquiries.

Financial Marketing Services 
 
 Revenue increased by 14 and 7 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for both periods is driven by growth in credit marketing services and risk and data services. 
 
 USIS Operating Margin 
 
 USIS operating margin decreased to 20.6 for the third quarter of 2024 from 21.1 for the third quarter of 2023 and decreased to 20.4 for the first nine months of 2024 from 21.0 for the first nine months of 2023. The margin decrease for both periods is due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenue. The increase in operating expenses in both periods is primarily due to increased royalty expenses, particularly in the mortgage vertical, higher costs of purchased data, and increased amortization of capitalized internal-use software from technology transformation capital spending incurred previously.

 International revenue increased by 9 and 13 in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 18 and 22 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in both periods is driven by Latin America, primarily due to revenue from the BVS acquisition and local currency growth in Argentina, as well as growth in Europe. The increase in the first nine months of 2024 is also due to growth in Canada, partially offset by a decline in Australia. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by 26.7 million, or 9 , for the third quarter of 2024, and by 79.0 million, or 9 , for the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Latin America 
 
 On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 58 and 90 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . The increase in both periods is primarily due to revenue from the BVS acquisition, which occurred in August of 2023, as well as local currency growth in Argentina. Revenue from the BVS acquisition was 38.1 million and 120.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 23.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by 29.6 million, or 37 , and 80.1 million, or 42 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respective ly, primarily in Argentina and Brazil. Reported revenue increased by 21 and 48 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Europe 
 
 On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 9 and 10 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . The increase for both periods is primarily due to growth in the debt services and credit reporting businesses in the U. K. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar positively impacted revenue by 2.4 million, or 2 , and 5.9 million, or 2 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively.

Reported revenue increased by 11 and 12 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Asia Pacific 
 
 On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 2 and decreased by 3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the third quarter is primarily driven by growth in the Australia commercial and consumer credit reporting businesses. The decrease in the first nine months is primarily driven by Australia due to declines in the commercial, direct to consumer, and consumer credit reporting businesses in the first half of the year. Local currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar positively impacted revenue by 1.6 million, or 2 for the third quarter, and negatively impacted revenue by 2.6 million, or 1 , for the first nine months of 2024, respectively. Reported revenue increased by 4 and decreased by 4 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Canada 
 
 On a local currency basis, revenue increased by 1 and 4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Revenue growth in both periods is driven by growth in the direct to consumer business. Local currency fluctuations agai nst the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by 1.1 million, or 1 , and 2.2 million or 1 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Reported revenue was flat and increased by 3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 International Operating Margin 
 
 Operating margin increased to 13.9 for the third quarter of 2024 from 12.7 for the third quarter of 2023 and was flat at 12.0 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The increased margin for the third quarter is due to the aforementioned increase in revenue. Margin was flat for the first nine months due to the aforementioned increase in revenue, offset by amortization costs, principally due to higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the BVS acquisition. 

General Corporate Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change General Corporate Expense 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) (In millions) General corporate expense 166.7 124.7 42.0 34 451.1 424.4 26.7 6 
 
 Our general corporate expenses are unallocated costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by the overall management and strategic choices of the company, including shared services overhead, technology, security, data and analytics, administrative, legal, restructuring, and the portion of management incentive compensation determined by total company-wide performance. 
 
 General corporate expense increased by 42.0 million and 26.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for both periods is primarily due to an increase in people costs, partially offset by a decrease in consulting services and lower litigation expense as a result of a penalty associated with resolution of the investigation of the 2017 cybersecurity incident by the U.K. FCA that was accrued in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in people costs for both periods is primarily due to restructuring charges and higher incentive plan costs. 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities, remain in a strong financial position and manage our capital structure to meet short- and long-term objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and completing strategic acquisitions. 
 
 Funds generated by operating activities, our 1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolver") and related commercial paper ("CP") program, more fully described below, are our most significant sources of liquidity. At 
 32 

September 30, 2024, we had 468.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as 1,498.6 million available to borrow under our Revolver. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We believe that our existing cash balance, liquidity available from our CP and Revolver, cash generated from ongoing operations and continued access to public or private debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. While there was no significant change in our cash requirements as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, we have utilized cash from operating activities to meet our current obligations. 
 
 Fund Transfer Limitations. The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the U.S. may be limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments. These restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. As of September 30, 2024, we held 180.5 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Net cash provided by (used in): 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 
 (In millions) Operating activities 999.7 794.7 205.0 Investing activities (392.6) (724.7) 332.1 Financing activities (345.0) 63.5 (408.5) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 205.0 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to changes in our working capital position. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Net cash used in: 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (In millions) Capital expenditures (392.6) (455.6) 63.0 
 Amounts above are total cash outflows for capital expenditures. 
 
 Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of certain software applications, investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements, and updating or expanding our office facilities. 
 
 Capital expenditures paid in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 63.0 million from the same period in 2023 due to lower capitalized software costs and lower spending on technology infrastructure as compared to the first nine months of 2023 as we continue to make progress toward completion of our technology transformation.

 During the first nine months of 2024, we did not complete any acquisitions. During the first nine months of 2023, we completed the acquisition of BVS and a Canadian company within our International segment and completed the sale of an equity investment. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Borrowings and Credit Facility Availability Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Net cash (used in) provided by: 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (In millions) Net short-term payments (195.9) (83.6) (112.3) Payments on long-term debt (695.6) (575.0) (120.6) Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt 649.8 872.9 (223.1) 
 
 Credit Facility Availability 
 
 We have access to a 1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolver"), which matures in August 2027. Borrowings under the Revolver may be used for working capital, for capital expenditures, to refinance existing debt, to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. The Revolver includes an option to request a maximum of three one-year extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the closing date of the Revolver. In May 2024, we exercised our first option to extend the maturity date by one year, from August 2026 to August 2027, and amended the Revolver agreement to replace a discontinued reference rate for Canadian Dollar-denominated commitments. Availability of the Revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our CP notes and by any letters of credit issued under the Revolver. 
 
 Our 1.5 billion CP program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of CP with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. We may use the proceeds of CP for general corporate purposes. The CP program is supported by our Revolver and the total amount of CP that may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our Revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding CP notes, 1.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver. Availability under the Revolver was 1,498.6 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt was fixed-rate debt. Our variable-rate debt consists of outstanding amounts under the Revolver and CP program, both of which were undrawn at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Borrowing and Repayment Activity 
 
 We primarily borrow under our CP program and Revolver as needed and as availability allows. 
 
 Net short-term payments primarily represent net borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our CP program. 
 
 Borrowings on long-term debt in 2024 represent the issuance of 650.0 million of 4.8 senior notes in the third quarter of 2024. Borrowings on long-term debt in 2023 represent 175.0 million of borrowings on our Revolver during the first quarter of 2023 and the issuance of 700.0 million of 5.1 senior notes in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 34 

Payments on long-term debt in 2024 represent 695.6 million of payments on the Term Loan during the first nine months of 2024. Payments on long-term debt in 2023 represent 175.0 million of repayments on our Revolver and repayment of our 400.0 million 3.95 senior notes during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Debt Covenants. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our CP program and our Revolver, and could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue CP. Our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on mortgages, liens, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. 
 
 The Revolver requires a maximum leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated EBITDA, of 3.75 to 1.0. We may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 0.5 to 1.0 (subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0) in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements. The Revolver also permits cash in excess of 175 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio, subject to certain restrictions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
 
 We do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, our 2.6 senior notes due 2024, 2.6 senior notes due 2025, 3.25 senior notes due 2026, 5.1 senior notes due 2027, 5.1 senior notes due 2028, 4.8 senior notes due 2029, 3.1 senior notes due 2030, 2.35 senior notes due 2031 and 7.0 senior notes due 2037 (collectively, the Senior Notes contain change in control provisions. If the Company experiences a change of control or publicly announces an intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the Senior Notes is lowered by Standard Poor s S P and Moody s Investors Service Moody s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 For additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Equity Transactions Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Net cash (used in) provided by: 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 (In millions) Dividends paid to Equifax shareholders (144.8) (143.7) (1.1) Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests (4.4) (2.8) (1.6) Proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan 67.5 18.6 48.9 Payment of taxes related to settlement of equity awards (16.4) (16.9) 0.5 
 
 Sources and uses of cash related to equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 - During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock on the open market. 
 
 - We maintained our quarterly dividend of 0.39 per share in the third quarter of 2024. We paid cash dividends to Equifax shareholders of 144.8 million and 143.7 million, or 1.17 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 - We received cash of 67.5 million and 18.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. 
 
 - We paid taxes of 16.4 million and 16.9 million related to the settlement of equity awards during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 520.2 million remaining for stock repurchases under the existing authorization from the board of directors.

Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies 
 
 Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments have not changed materially from those reported in our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information about certain obligations and contingencies, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There have been no material changes with respect to our off-balance sheet arrangements from those presented in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Benefit Plans 
 
 At December 31, 2023, our U.S. Retirement Income Plan met or exceeded ERISA s minimum funding requirements. In the future, we expect to make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and our liquidity needs. We believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our CP program and our Revolver. 
 
 For our non-U.S., tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. For our non-qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 For additional information about our benefit plans, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 
 Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we have accounted for Argentina as a highly inflationary economy which resulted in the recognition of a foreign currency loss of 0.3 million and 0.4 million that was recorded in Other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section in the MD A, and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in our 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in Part II, Item 7A of our 2023 Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our market risk exposure during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. In addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Remaining Matters Related to 2017 Cybersecurity Incident 
 
 Canadian Class Actions . Five putative Canadian class actions, four of which are on behalf of a national class of approximately 19,000 Canadian consumers, are pending against us in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. Each of the proposed Canadian class actions asserts a number of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and other related relief in connection with a material cybersecurity incident in 2017. In addition to seeking class certification on behalf of Canadian consumers whose personal information was allegedly impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident, in some cases, plaintiffs also seek class certification on behalf of a larger group of Canadian consumers who had contracts for subscription products with Equifax around the time of the incident or earlier and were not impacted by the incident. The Ontario class action has been certified in part but is otherwise at a preliminary stage. All other purported class actions are at preliminary stages or stayed. 
 
 CFPB Matters 
 
 In December 2021, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (a CID from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB as part of its investigation into our consumer disputes process at our USIS business unit in order to determine whether we have followed Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA requirements for the proper handling of consumer disputes. The CID requested the production of documents and answers to written questions. In January 2023, the CFPB informed us that its enforcement division would be investigating our previously-disclosed coding issue identified within a legacy server environment in the U.S. that impacted how some credit scores were calculated during a three-week period in 2022. The staff of the CFPB has informed us that the CFPB intends to seek injunctive and civil money penalties against us based on allegations related to the consumer disputes investigation and the coding issue investigation. We are engaging in discussions with the CFPB and we are cooperating with the CFPB in its investigations. 
 
 In July 2023, we received a CID from the CFPB as part of its investigation into data accuracy and dispute handling at our Workforce Solutions business unit in order to determine whether we have followed the FCRA's requirements. We received a second CID from the CFPB in March 2024 and a third CID from the CFPB in August 2024 as part of the same investigation. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to written questions. We are cooperating with the CFPB in its investigation and providing responses and information on an ongoing basis. 
 
 At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of these CFPB investigations, including whether the investigations will result in any actions or proceedings against us. 
 
 Other 
 
 Equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions, including administrative claims, regulatory matters, government investigations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business. Some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We believe we have defenses to and, where appropriate, will contest many of these matters. Given the number of these matters, some are likely to result in adverse judgments, penalties, injunctions, fines or other relief. We may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process. 
 
 For information regarding our accounting for legal contingencies, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

 2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 

EQUIFAX INC. 
 2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
