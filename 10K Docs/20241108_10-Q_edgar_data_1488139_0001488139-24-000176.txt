 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for the full year. The December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our annual report on Form 10-K 2023 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024 as amended on March 11, 2024. 
 Significant Risks and Uncertainties 
 Global factors have continued to result in global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. 
 We have considered the impact of general global economic conditions on the assumptions and estimates used, which may change in response to this evolving situation. Results of future operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by a number of factors including supply chain disruptions, varying levels of inflation, payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, workforce disruptions, and uncertain demand. As of the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, we cannot reasonably estimate the extent to which macroeconomic conditions may impact our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations in the foreseeable future. The ultimate impact of the pandemic and general global economic conditions on our business is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, and such impacts could exist for an extended period of time, even after the pandemic subsides.

The interest and principal are paid quarterly commencing on March 31, 2024. We failed to achieve the final conditions required to convert the term loan on or prior to June 30, 2024, therefore, the outstanding balance was classified as current debt at June 30, 2024. We received a waiver and met the final conditions on August 14, 2024 and the current and non-current debt was classified accordingly at September 30, 2024.

 The effective tax rate benefit was for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the effective tax rate benefit of for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The principal reasons for the higher effective rate for 2024 are primarily due to the effects of foreign earnings, a smaller period discrete benefit and lower current year forecast for Section 179D Energy Efficient Building deductions, offset by higher investment tax credits from solar, and storage plants placed into service or are forecasted to be placed into service during 2024.

 grid scale battery energy storage system BESS at three sites near existing substation parcels throughout SCE s service territory in California with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 megawatt MW ( the SCE Agreement ). As previously disclosed, due to supply chain delays, weather, and other events, we were unable to complete the projects by August 1, 2022 (the Guaranteed Completion Date and made related force majeure claims. In late 2022, SCE also instructed us to adjust the completion of the sites into 2023. Under the SCE Agreement, a failure to reach the Guaranteed Co mpletion Date could, under certain circumstances, result in liquidated damages up to a maximum amount of million being applied. On August 30 2024, we reached an agreement with SCE on the substantial completion of two out of battery energy storage system projects. We received approximately million on September 5, 2024 as milestone payments, reflecting a set-off of liquidated damages for these two projects. The agreement confirmed that the final resolution related to our obligation to pay the liquidated damages withheld and the applicability and scope of any force majeure relief as well as any cost recovery we may be entitled to remain subject to dispute. We are continuing discussions with SCE on these matters and our view continues to be that liquidated damages should not be applied. It is at least reasonably possible we may incur an obligation to pay liquidated damages up to the maximum amount. 
 Commitments as a Result of Acquisitions 
 In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Plug Smart which provided for an earn-out based on future EBITDA targets beginning with EBITDA performance for the month of December 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, over a period through December 31, 2026. The maximum cumulative earn-out is and we evaluated financial forecasts of the acquired business and concluded that the fair value of this earn-out after payments of was approximately at December 31,

 The August 4, 2023 purchase and sale agreement with BCE includes a potential earn-out that could be earned if the projects achieve specified value thresholds in certain phase 2 projects, each of which is very early in development, or if milestones are achieved on other future projects that are not yet started. The total earn-out is limited to over a period beginning on January 12, 2024. We will record a liability for the phase 2 earn-out payments when the amounts are probable and estimable.

Key Factors and Trends 
 The Inflation Reduction Act IRA 
 The IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The bill invests nearly 369 billion in energy and climate policies. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, incentivize domestic clean energy investment, manufacturing, and deployment. The IRA incentivizes the deployment of clean energy technologies by extending and expanding federal incentives such as the ITC and the Production Tax Credit PTC ). We view the enactment of the IRA as favorable for the overall business climate for the renewable energy industry. However, uncertainty related to the applicability of the IRA to our current and planned projects and the scope of the IRA, and its interpretations may change as a result of the change in the U.S. administration or as a result of government agencies authority to interpret federal law being restricted as a result of the Supreme Court s overturning of the Chevron doctrine. We may also continue to experience a delay in our sales cycles and new award activity as our customers consider the applicability of the IRA and as financing projects may take longer as result of this uncertainty. The IRA may increase the competition in our industry and as such increase the demand and cost for labor, equipment and commodities needed for our projects. 
 Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Global Factors 
 We continue to monitor the impact of global conditions on our operations, financial results, and liquidity, such as the impact of supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the Middle East, the volatile U.S. political climate, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the results of the U.S. presidential election and evolving relations between the U.S. and China. The impact to our future operations, results of operations as a result of these global trends, remains uncertain and the challenges we face, such as demand for our products and services, governmental support for clean energy, an increase in costs for logistics and supply chains, intermittent supplier delays, and shortages of certain components needed for our business, such as lithium-ion battery cells, semiconductors, and other components required for our clean energy solutions may continue or become more pronounced. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were impacted by supply chain disruptions and varying levels of inflation, as a result macroeconomic conditions. These conditions caused delays in the timely delivery of material to customer sites, delays and disruptions in the completion of certain projects, increased shipping and transportation costs, and increased component and labor costs. This negatively impacted our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect the trends of supply chain challenges to continue. We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate to address the challenges presented from these conditions. 
 In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a final ruling in the Auxin Solar trade case related to solar tariff imports that will lead to higher tariffs on certain imported solar products from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia beginning in June 2024. Similarly, the imposition of additional tariffs, changes in trade regulations, and the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act could disrupt the solar panel supply chain and increase the cost for components and services required for our clean energy solutions. This could ultimately impact the demand for clean energy solutions and increase our costs. We are closely monitoring the investigation and any related trade and tariff regulations. 
 Climate Change and Effects of Seasonality 
 The global emphasis on climate change and reducing carbon emissions has created opportunities for our industry. Sustainability has been at the forefront of our business since its inception, and we are committed to staying at the leading edge of innovation taking place in the energy sector. We believe the next decade will be marked by dramatic changes in the power infrastructure with resources shifting to more distributed assets, storage, and microgrids to increase overall reliability and resiliency. The sustainability efforts are impacted by regulations, and changes in the regulatory climate may impact the demand for our products and offerings. See Our business depends in part on federal, state, provincial and local government support or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties, or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, for energy efficiency and renewable energy, and a decline in such support could harm our business and Compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our operating results in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Climate change also brings risks, as the impacts have caused us to experience more frequent and severe weather interferences, and this trend is expected to continue. We are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United States and Canada, and climates that experience extreme weather events, such as wildfires, storms or flooding, hurricanes, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. In addition, government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Further, government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive 
 33

demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. As a result, our revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarter are typically higher, and our revenues and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower, than in other quarters of the year, however, this may become harder to predict with the potential effects of climate change. As a result of such fluctuations, we may occasionally experience declines in revenues or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. 
 Our annual and quarterly financial results are also subject to significant fluctuations as a result of other factors, many of which are outside our control. See Our business is affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles, and these trends and cycles could have an adverse effect on our operating results and Extreme weather events and other natural disasters, particularly those exacerbated by climate change, could materially affect our ability to complete our projects and develop our assets in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Southern California Edison SCE Agreement 
 In October 2021, we entered into a contract with SCE to design and build three grid scale battery energy storage system BESS at three sites near existing substation parcels throughout SCE s service territory in California with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 megawatt MW ( the SCE Agreement ). The engineering, procurement and construction price is approximately 892.0 million, in the aggregate, including two years of O M revenues, subject to customary potential adjustments for changes in the work. As previously disclosed, due to supply chain delays, weather and other events, we were unable to complete the projects by August 1, 2022 (the Guaranteed Completion Date and made related force majeure claims. In late 2022, SCE also instructed us to adjust the completion of the sites into 2023. Under the SCE Agreement, a failure to reach the Guaranteed Completion Date could, under certain circumstances, result in liquidated damages up to a maximum amount of 89 million being applied. 
 On August 30 2024, we reached an agreement with SCE on the substantial completion of two out of three battery energy storage system projects. We received approximately 110 million on September 5, 2024 as milestone payments, reflecting both a set-off of liquidated damages which are still in dispute and 3 million that SCE withheld for additional work SCE required. Upon final acceptance of these two projects, we will invoice SCE for the remaining final acceptance milestone payments for these projects. The Agreement also confirmed that the final resolution related to our obligation to pay the liquidated damages withheld and the applicability and scope of any force majeure relief as well as any cost recovery we may be entitled to remain subject to dispute. Ameresco is continuing discussions with SCE on these matters and its view continues to be that liquidated damages should not be applied. If we fail to come to an agreement with SCE about the applicability and scope of force majeure relief and liquidated damages, we may be required to pay liquidated damages up to an aggregate maximum of 89 million and may not be able to recover costs associated with the force majeure events. 
 The third project is expected to reach substantial completion during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 A majority of our revenues under this contract were recognized in 2022 based upon costs incurred in 2022 relative to total expected costs on this project. 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted 626,503 common stock options and 122,366 restricted stock units RSUs to certain employees and directors under our 2020 Plan. Our unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was 29.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 30.1 million at December 31, 2023, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. See Note 16 Stock-based Compensation for additional information. 
 Backlog and Awarded Projects 
 Backlog is an important metric for us because we believe strong order backlogs indicate growing demand and a healthy business over the medium to long term, conversely, a declining backlog could imply lower demand.

Table of Contents 

The following table presents our backlog: As of September 30, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 Project Backlog Fully-contracted backlog 1,852,774 1,188,460 Awarded, not yet signed customer contracts 2,656,082 2,512,880 Total project backlog 4,508,856 3,701,340 12-month project backlog 976,530 765,125 O M Backlog Fully-contracted backlog 1,421,204 1,237,985 12-month O M backlog 91,380 87,475 
 Total project backlog represents energy efficiency projects that are active within our sales cycle. Our sales cycle begins with the initial contact with the customer and ends, when successful, with a signed contract, also referred to as fully-contracted backlog. Our sales cycle averages 18 to 42 months. Awarded backlog is created when a potential customer awards a project to Ameresco following a request for proposal. Once a project is awarded but not yet contracted, we typically conduct a detailed energy audit to determine the scope of the project as well as identify the savings that may be expected to be generated from upgrading the customer s energy infrastructure. At this point, we also determine the subcontractors, what equipment will be used, and assist in arranging for third party financing, as applicable. It takes an average of 12 to 24 months to convert our awarded backlog to fully-contracted backlog. It may take longer, as it depends on the size and complexity of the project. Historically, approximately 90 of our awarded backlog projects have resulted in a signed contract. After the customer and Ameresco agree to the terms of the contract and the contract is executed, the project moves to fully-contracted backlog. The contracts reflected in our fully-contracted backlog typically have a construction period of 12 to 36 months and we typically expect to recognize revenue for such contracts over the same period. 
 Our O M backlog represents expected future revenues under signed, multi-year customer contracts for the delivery of O M services, primarily for energy efficiency and renewable energy construction projects completed by us for our customers. 
 We define our 12-month backlog as the estimated amount of revenues that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months from our fully-contracted backlog. See We may not recognize all revenues from our backlog or receive all payments anticipated under awarded projects and customer contracts and In order to secure contracts for new projects, we typically face a long and variable selling cycle that requires significant resource commitments and requires a long lead time before we realize revenues in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Assets in Development 
 Assets in development, which represents the potential design/build project value of renewable energy plants that have been awarded or for which we have secured development rights, were estimated at 2.3 billion and 1.8 billion, net of amount attributable to a non-controlling interest at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This is another important metric because it helps us gauge our future capital expenditure needs and develop-and-sell opportunities as well as our capacity to generate electricity or deliver renewable gas fuel which contributes to our recurring revenue stream.

Results of Operations 
 All financial result comparisons made below are against the same prior year period unless otherwise noted. 
 The following tables set forth certain financial data from the condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated:

 Our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are due to the following: 
 Revenues: total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased over 2023 primarily due to a 142.7 million, or 59 , increase in our project revenues attributed to the timing of revenue recognized based upon costs incurred to date relative to total expected costs on active projects. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit: the increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increase in project revenues described above and higher depreciation expenses from the continued growth in our operating assets portfolio. Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased due primarily to cost budget revisions on our SCE battery storage projects and a mix of lower-margin projects. 
 Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities: the decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities is due to the sale of one of our equity method investments during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A ): SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased over 2023 primarily due to lower professional fees partially offset by higher occupancy costs, salaries and related benefits and insurance. 
 Other Expenses, Net: Other expenses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased over 2023 primarily due to higher interest expenses, net of 9.2 million related to an increase in the amount of energy asset financings and corporate debt outstanding and higher interest rates and increased losses from derivatives transactions of 6.7 million, partially offset by increased gains from foreign currency transactions of 3.6 million and a decrease in factoring fees of 1.8 million. 
 Income Tax Benefit: the benefit for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal, state, provincial and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements. We expect the effective tax rate will be higher in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the effects of foreign earnings, a smaller period discrete benefit and lower current year forecast for Section 179D Energy Efficient Building deductions, offset by higher investment tax credits from solar, and storage plants placed into service or are forecasted to be placed into service during 2024.

 Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are due to the following: 
 Revenues: total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over 2023 primarily due to a 265.6 million, or 41 , increase in our project revenues attributed to the timing of revenue recognized based upon costs incurred to date relative to total expected costs on active projects. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit: the increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to the increase in project revenues described above and higher depreciation expenses from the continued growth in our operating assets portfolio. Gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased due primarily to cost budget revisions on our SCE battery storage projects and a mix of lower-margin projects. 
 Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities: the decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities is due to the sale of one of our equity method investments to during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A ): SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over 2023 primarily due to higher insurance and occupancy costs, other miscellaneous charges, and charges to credit losses partially offset by lower professional fees and salaries and related benefits as a result of a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and lower project development costs. 
 Other Expenses, Net: Other expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over 2023 primarily due to higher interest expenses, net of 23.8 million related to an increase in the amount of energy asset financings and corporate debt outstanding and higher interest rates, increased losses from derivatives transactions of 3.0 million, partially offset by increased gains from foreign currency transaction of 1.9 million and a decrease in factoring fees of 2.2 million. 
 Income Tax Benefit: the benefit for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal, state, provincial and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements. We expect the effective tax rate will be higher in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the effects of foreign earnings, a smaller period discrete benefit and lower current year forecast for Section 179D Energy Efficient Building deductions, offset by higher investment tax credits from solar, and storage plants placed into service or are forecasted to be placed into service during 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Since inception, we have funded operations primarily through cash flow from operations, advances from Federal ESPC projects, our senior secured credit facility, our second lien term loan and various forms of other debt and equity offerings. See Note 8 Debt and Financing Lease Liabilities for additional information. 
 Working capital requirements can be susceptible to fluctuations during the year due to timing differences between costs incurred, the timing of milestone-based customer invoices and actual cash collections. Working capital may also be affected by seasonality, growth rate of revenue, long lead-time equipment purchase patterns, advances from Federal ESPC projects, and payment terms for payables relative to customer receivables. 
 We expect to incur additional expenditures in connection with the following activities: 
 equity investments, project asset acquisitions and business acquisitions that we may fund from time to time 
 capital investment in current and future energy assets 
 material, equipment, and other expenditures for large projects 
 We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet funding requirements. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, working capital and availability under our revolving senior secured credit facility, combined with our right (subject to lender consent) to increase our revolving credit facility by 100.0 million, plus asset sales, tax equity transfers, ITC sales, and our general access to credit and equity markets, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least November 2025 and thereafter. 
 We continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate and that we can meet our capital and debt service requirements. This may include limiting discretionary spending across the organization and re-prioritizing our capital projects amid times of political unrest, the duration of supply challenges, the rate and duration of the inflationary pressures, and other events affecting our liquidity. For example, recent increases in inflation and interest rates have impacted overall market returns on assets. We have therefore been particularly prudent in our capital commitments over the past few quarters, ensuring that our assets in development continue to align with our hurdle rates. 
 August 2023 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 On August 4, 2023, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire an energy asset project and to acquire 100 of the stock of Bright Canyon Energy Corporation BCE in a two-phased transaction. Phase 1, the purchase of the energy asset project, closed on August 4, 2023 and did not constitute a business in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations. 
 The purchase price for phase 1 was 88.0 million, of which 5.0 million was paid in cash, 46.7 million was financed through a seller s note, and we assumed a construction loan on the energy asset project for 36.3 million. We also acquired 11.2 million cash. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid 18.4 million in principal on the seller s note. In January 2024, the purchase price was increased by 1.1 million, and we paid off the seller s note in the amount of 29.4 million. We agreed to sell 
 39 

Table of Contents 

back to the seller investment tax credits for the project acquired as part of this transaction for the fair market value of these credits in early in 2024 and received 21.0 million in cash during March 2024. 
 In the second phase, which closed on January 12, 2024, we acquired BCE, including its interest in a consolidated joint venture and its interests in project subsidiaries developing or with rights to develop solar, battery, and microgrid assets for an adjusted purchase price of 48.0 million, of which 9.8 million was paid in cash at closing, and 32.5 million was financed through a seller s note. The remaining balance due of 5.7 million was paid during nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also assumed four land leases for the energy asset projects. 
 The seller s note bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.0 per annum and the principal and interest was due in August 2024. The note was amended on August 2, 2024 to provide that it be paid in four installments through December 16, 2024 and bears interest at a rate of 5.0 per annum through August 2, 2024 and a rate of 9.0 per annum thereafter. The note was also amended on September 17, 2024 to provide that it be paid in three installments through November 1, 2024. In September 2024, we paid a portion of the seller s note in the amount of 12.5 million. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 On April 10, 2024, we entered into amendment number five to the fifth amended and restated senior secured credit facility to extend the maturity date of the delayed draw term loan A DDTLA from March 4, 2025 to August 15, 2024. The amendment also included the following modifications: 
 principal installments on the DDTLA of 5 million when we entered into the amendment and 8 million each on or before May 15, 2024, June 15, 2024, and July 15, 2024, with the balance of 7,500 due on August 15, 2024, 
 the date by which we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to raise 100 million in equity or subordinated debt financing was changed from April 15, 2024 to May 15, 2024. 
 On June 28, 2024, we entered into amendment number six to the fifth amended and restated senior secured credit facility to modify certain of the covenants and other terms to permit us to enter into the second lien credit agreement (as defined below) and to incur indebtedness and make certain other conforming changes in connection with our entry into the second lien credit agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the balance on the senior secured term loans was 71.3 million, the balance on the senior secured revolving credit facility was 106.5 million, and we had funds available of 67.1 million. 
 June 2024, Second Lien Term Loan, due June 28, 2029 
 On June 28, 2024, we entered into a second lien credit agreement which provided a term loan in a principal amount of 100.0 million with a maturity date of June 28, 2029. The term loan bears an interest rate of SOFR (5.309 at September 30, 2024), and an applicable margin of 5.875 per annum. Interest is payable quarterly and unpaid interest and principal is due in the aggregate on June 28, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we incurred 5.1 million in lenders fees and debt issuance costs. Proceeds from this term loan in the amount of 82.1 million and 15.0 million were used to pay towards our credit facility and the outstanding portion of the DDTLA, respectively, under our senior secured credit facility at closing. 
 Energy Asset Financing 
 Energy Asset Construction Facilities, Financing Facilities, and Term Loans 
 We have entered into a number of construction and term loan agreements for the purpose of constructing and owning certain renewable energy plants. The physical assets and the operating agreements related to the renewable energy plants are generally owned by wholly owned, single member special purpose subsidiaries of Ameresco. These construction and term loans are structured as project financings made directly to a subsidiary, and upon commercial operation and achieving certain milestones in the credit agreement, the related construction loan converts into a term loan. While we are required under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP to reflect these loans as liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, they are generally non-recourse and not direct obligations of Ameresco, Inc., except to the extent of completion guarantees and EPC contracts and certain equity contribution obligations under our August 2023 Construction Credit Facility as described in more detail below. 
 Our project financing facilities contain various financial and other covenant requirements which include debt service coverage ratios and total funded debt to EBITDA, as defined in the facilities. Any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our project financings would result in inability to distribute funds from the wholly-owned subsidiary to Ameresco, Inc. or

constitute an event of default in which the lenders may have the ability to accelerate the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees. 
 Material energy asset construction and term loan financings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 April 2024, Term Notes, due June 30, 2042 - On April 5, 2024, an omnibus amendment and reaffirmation agreement was executed with reference to the note purchase and private shelf agreement, dated as of July 27, 2021, and two new series B notes (first lien and second lien) were authorized in the amounts of 92.5 million and 12.7 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2042. Gross proceeds from the initial issuance on April 5, 2024 were 83.3 million and 12.3 million with the remainder to be issued upon achieving certain permitting-related and other administrative conditions. Proceeds from these notes in the amount of 86.5 million were used to pay a portion of the August 2023 construction credit facility. 
 October 2022, Financing Facility, 6.70 - we drew down an additional 38.3 million. 
 August 2023, Construction Credit Facility , 9.16 - we drew down an additional 137.0 million. 
 Net proceeds from energy asset construction facilities and term loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 301.4 million. 
 Sale-leasebacks and Financing Leases 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold and leased back three energy assets for 24.3 million in cash proceeds under our master sale-leaseback agreements. 
 On April 18, 2023, in connection with the April 2023, Construction Credit Facility , we entered into lease agreements with two investors and on August 14, 2024 we sold and leased back an energy asset for 234.8 million, of which 50 was allocated to each investor under these agreements. One lease has an expiration date of August 14, 2034 with an option to extend to August 14, 2044 while the other as an expiration date of August 14, 2044. At closing, we incurred 2.8 million in lenders fees and debt issuance costs. In August 2024, we used 140.8 million of the proceeds to pay off the April 2023, Construction Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we have no available funds remaining under this lending commitment. 
 
 Federal ESPC Liabilities 
 We have arrangements with certain third-parties to provide advances to us during the construction or installation of projects for certain customers, typically federal governmental entities, in exchange for our assignment to the lenders of our rights to the long-term receivables arising from the ESPCs related to such projects. These financings totaled 520.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Under the terms of these financing arrangements, we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer, and the liability remains on our condensed consolidated balance sheets until the completed project is accepted by the customer. 
 We are the primary obligor for financing received, but only until final acceptance of the work by the customer. At this point recourse to us ceases and the ESPC receivables are transferred to the investor. The transfers of receivables under these agreements do not qualify for sales accounting until final customer acceptance of the work, so the advances from the investors are not classified as operating cash flows. Cash draws that we received under these ESPC agreements were 129.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and are recorded as financing cash inflows. The use of the cash received under these arrangements is to pay project costs classified as operating cash flows and totaled 110.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to the manner in which the ESPC contracts with the third-party investors are structured, our reported operating cash flows are materially impacted by the fact that operating cash flows only reflect the ESPC contract expenditure outflows and do not reflect any inflows from the corresponding contract revenues. Upon acceptance of the project by the federal customer the ESPC receivable and corresponding ESPC liability are removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheets as a non-cash settlement.

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 Change Cash flows from operating activities 99,222 (40,421) 139,643 Cash flows from investing activities (355,392) (465,193) 109,801 Cash flows from financing activities 305,058 532,401 (227,343) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,827 (980) 2,807 Total net cash flows 50,715 25,807 24,908 
 Our service offering also includes the development, construction, and operation of small-scale renewable energy plants. Small-scale renewable energy projects, or energy assets, can either be developed for the portfolio of assets that we own and operate or designed and built for customers. Expenditures related to projects that we own are recorded as cash outflows from investing activities. Expenditures related to projects that we build for customers are recorded as cash outflows from operating activities as cost of revenues. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the same period last year primarily due to increases in cash flows of 121.4 million in unbilled revenue (costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings) due to the timing of when certain projects are invoiced, including our SCE battery storage project when compared to the prior year period, 26.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, 52.0 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, 32.8 million in Federal ESPC receivable, and 32.1 million in deferred revenue (billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings), partially offset by decreases of 122.2 million in accounts receivable and 14.8 million in net income. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we made capital investments of 341.8 million in new energy assets and 13.6 million in major maintenance of energy assets compared to 445.5 million and 8.0 million, respectively, in 2023. 
 We currently plan to invest approximately 20 million to 75 million in additional capital expenditures during the remainder of 2024, principally for the construction or acquisition of new renewable energy plants, the majority of which we expect to fund with project finance debt. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our primary sources of financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were net proceeds from long-term debt of 653.5 million, net proceeds received from Federal ESPC projects and energy asset receivable financing arrangements of 134.6 million, contributions from a non-controlling interest of 33.8 million, offset by payments on long-term debt of 441.6 million, net, payments on the seller s note for the BCE phase 1 and 2 acquisitions of 41.9 million, and net payments on our senior secured revolving credit facility of 33.4 million. 
 Our primary sources of financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were net proceeds from long-term debt of 720.0 million, net proceeds received from Federal ESPC projects and energy asset receivable financing arrangements of 119.8 million, partially offset by payments on long-term debt of 162.7 million and net payments on our senior secured revolving credit facility of 115.0 million. 
 We currently plan additional project financings of approximately 50 million during the remainder of 2024 to fund the construction or the acquisition of new renewable energy plants as discussed above. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves us making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosures in the accompanying notes at the date of our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, by their nature, 
 42 

Table of Contents 

estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties, and changes in circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have reviewed all tax positions taken as of September 30, 2024 and there were no additional uncertain tax positions taken during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe our current tax reserves are adequate to cover all known tax uncertainties. 
 Other than as noted above, there have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for updates to critical accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in market risk exposures that materially affected the quantitative and qualitative disclosures as described in Item 7A to our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, or the evaluation date. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date, concluded that as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 Director and Officer 
 A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other shares of Class A common stock held by such individuals. Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in a company s securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.
