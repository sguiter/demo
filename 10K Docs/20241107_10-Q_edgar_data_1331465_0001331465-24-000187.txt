 Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk to its derivative transactions due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties and manages this risk through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in its policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, and Finance Agency regulations. 
 
 For uncleared derivatives, the degree of credit risk depends on the extent to which master netting arrangements are included in such contracts to mitigate the risk. The Bank requires collateral agreements with collateral delivery thresholds on all uncleared derivatives. Additionally, collateral related to derivatives with member institutions includes collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.

Executive Summary 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 The material factors impacting the Bank s business outlook remain largely unchanged from the discussion in the Bank s Form 10-K. The Bank considers macroeconomic drivers in its strategic planning process and business models. External factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect either positive or negative on the Bank s financial performance. 
 
 On November 7, 2023, the Finance Agency released its FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future report. In the report, the Finance Agency presented their review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations that it plans to pursue in service of their vision for the future of the FHLBank System, some of which may be enacted by the Finance Agency by way of regulatory guidance or proposed rulemaking, some of which call for further study, and some of which would require legislative action. The Finance Agency issued its 2023 Report to Congress on June 14, 2024 in which legislative recommendations were made for the FHLBank System. The Bank is monitoring Finance Agency actions in order to assess any

impact those may have on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. For a further discussion on the report, see Legislative and Regulatory Developments section below. 

Recent Hurricane Activity 
 
 On August 5, 2024, Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane and caused flooding across the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. 
 
 On September 26, 2024, Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida and moved quickly inland through Georgia. The storm continued inland causing catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding, particularly in western North Carolina, East Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. 
 
 On October 9, 2024, Milton made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on the west coast of Florida. In addition to destructive winds and rain, Milton also produced multiple tornadoes. 
 
 The Bank continues to analyze the potential impact that damage related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton might have on the Bank s advances, letters of credit, mortgage loans held for portfolio, and non-agency MBS. Based on current assessments, the Bank does not expect losses related to the hurricanes, if any, to have a material impact to the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 

Financial Condition 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s total assets, total liabilities, and total capital (dollars in millions). 
 Change As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Amount Percent Total assets 135,793 152,370 (16,577) (10.88) Total liabilities 127,933 144,254 (16,321) (11.31) Total capital 7,860 8,116 (256) (3.15) 
 
 Total assets decreased primarily due to a 10.1 billion, or 10.4 percent, decrease in total advances, and a 6.3 billion, or 11.7 percent, decrease in total investments. 
 
 Total liabilities decreased primarily due to a 17.2 billion, or 12.1 percent, decrease in consolidated obligations as a result of decreased funding and liquidity needs during the period. 
 
 Total capital decreased primarily due to a 438 million, or 7.82 percent, decrease in capital stock, partially offset by a 184 million, or 7.29 percent, increase in retained earnings.

 The decreases in net interest income and net income for the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to a decrease in average advance balances. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was also impacted by 18 million in voluntary housing contributions, compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The increases in net interest income and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to an increase in interest rates which impacted income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in average advance balances. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was also impacted by 33 million in voluntary housing contributions, compared to 7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Average advance balances were 89.8 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 108.5 billion for the same period in 2023, and 99.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 130.1 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in average advance balances was primarily due to market liquidity concerns that occurred during the first quarter of 2023 and continued to impact advance balances through the beginning of the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s significant income ratios. These items are discussed in more detail below.

Advances 
 
 Total advances decreased by 10.4 percent as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. A significant percentage of advances originated during the first nine months of 2024 were short-term advances. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 44.1 percent of the Bank s advances were fixed-rate, compared to 40.5 percent as of December 31, 2023. However, the Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates on them, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, primarily based on SOFR. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 69.7 percent and 64.9 percent, respectively, of the total Bank s fixed-rate advances were swapped. SOFR-indexed and OIS-indexed advances comprised 88.7 percent and 8.85 percent, respectively of the Bank s variable-rate advances as of September 30, 2024. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to other indices, such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, or constant maturity swap rates.

 The Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank s previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it intends to purchase the securities. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement at the time of its MBS purchases. As of September 30, 2024 these investments were 330 percent of the Bank s regulatory capital. The Bank is not required to sell any previously purchased MBS, however, the Bank will be precluded from purchasing additional MBS until its MBS to regulatory capital declines below 300 percent. 
 
 The amount held in other investments varies each day based on the Bank s liquidity needs as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high-quality counterparties in the federal funds market.

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 
 
 The Bank purchased fixed-rate residential mortgage loans directly from member participating financial institutions and through participation in eligible mortgage loans from other FHLBanks. The decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayment of these assets during the period. 
 Members that sold mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore, the Bank s conventional mortgage loan portfolio was concentrated in that region as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Florida 22.12 22.24 South Carolina 20.81 21.12 Virginia 11.16 11.55 Georgia 10.70 10.92 North Carolina 7.92 7.83 All other 27.29 26.34 Total 100.00 100.00 

Consolidated Obligations 
 
 The Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The decrease in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of decreased funding and liquidity needs during the period. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 91.6 percent of the 135.8 billion in total assets as of September 30, 2024, a slight decrease from the financing ratio of 92.9 percent as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Bank often simultaneously enters into derivatives with the issuance of fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, primarily based on SOFR. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 91.7 percent and 92.4 percent, respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank s variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 79.4 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped. 

Deposits 
 
 The Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. All the Bank s deposits are uninsured. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank s deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank. 

Capital 
 The FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank was in compliance with these regulatory capital rules and requirements as shown in Note 8 Capital to the Bank s interim financial statements. 
 Finance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows: 
 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; 
 35 

Table of Contents 

Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; 
 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and 
 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets. 
 
 The Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On November 6, 2024, the Bank received notification from the Finance Agency that, based on September 30, 2024 data, it will recommend to the Director that the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized. 
 
 The Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin providing for each FHLBank to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with this ratio. 
 
 The Bank s financial management policy and capital plan are discussed in more detail in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Capital and in Note 10 - Capital to the Bank s audited financial statements for the year ended on December 31, 2023, respectively, both included in the Bank s Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations 
 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank s results of operations. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 The primary source of the Bank s earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. 
 
 As discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. Fair value gains and losses on derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedging relationships are also recognized in interest income or interest expense. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of 169 million and 211 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a decrease of 554 million and 624 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Below are the primary factors that impacted net interest income and net income for the third quarter and first nine months 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 221 million compared to net interest income of 240 million for the same period in 2023. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 150 million compared to net income of 178 million for the same period in 2023. The decreases in net interest income and net income were primarily due to a decrease in average advance balances. Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was also impacted by 18 million in voluntary housing contributions, compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 was 716 million, compared to net interest income of 648 million for the same period in 2023. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 521 million, compared to net income of 475 million for the same period in 2023. The increases in net interest income and net income were primarily due to an increase in interest rates which impacted income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in average advance balances. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was also impacted by 33 million in voluntary housing contributions, compared to 7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Average advance balances were 89.8 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 108.5 billion for the same period in 2023, and 99.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 130.1 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in average advance balances was primarily due to market liquidity concerns that occurred during the first quarter of 2023 and continued to impact advance balances through the beginning of the third quarter of 2023. 

The following tables present the change in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank s derivatives. For example, as discussed above, when derivatives qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is included in net interest income and in the calculation of interest-rate spread. When derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss). Amortization associated with hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread. 
 
 The net yield on interest-earning assets was 61 basis points and 63 basis points for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to 59 basis points and 47 basis points for the same periods in 2023. The overall change in net interest income during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily volume related, including lower average advance balances. The overall change in net interest income during the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily rate related as increases in interest rates impacted income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities. The rate-related impact to net interest income was partially offset by a decrease in average advance balances.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is necessary to satisfy members borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank is required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and policies established by the Bank s management and board of directors. In addition, the Finance Agency, at times, has issued guidance and expectations to the FHLBanks related to liquidity. 
 Sources of Liquidity. The Bank s principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank s consolidated obligations are not obligations of the U.S. and are not guaranteed by either the U.S. or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government 
 42 

Table of Contents 

bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank s income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period. 
 The Bank s short-term funding is generally driven by member advance demand and is achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of recent SEC money market fund reform, have often sought the Bank s short-term debt as an asset of choice. 
 The Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balance and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 Contingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance and extraordinary market events. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of 4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977. 
 Liquidity Reserves for Deposits. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to hold a total amount of obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits. The Bank has complied with this requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024. 
 Operational Liquidity. In order to ensure adequate operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank s intraday needs) each day, Bank policy establishes a daily liquidity target based upon member deposit levels and current day liability maturities and asset settlements. The Bank has met this liquidity requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024. 
 Additional Liquidity Guidance. The Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank liquidity (Liquidity Guidance AB) that communicates the Finance Agency s expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Bank to provide advances and standby letters of credit for members during a sustained capital market disruption, assuming no access to capital markets and assuming renewal of all maturing advances for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days. The Finance Agency periodically issues supervisory letters that identify thresholds for measures of liquidity within the established ranges set forth in the Liquidity Guidance AB. 
 The Liquidity Guidance AB s measurements of liquidity include a cash flow scenario, on a daily basis, that projects forward the number of days for which the Bank should maintain positive cash balances assuming the renewal of all maturing advances and the maintenance of a liquidity reserve for outstanding letters of credit. The measurements of liquidity also include a funding gap measurement of the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the Bank s total assets to reduce the liquidity risks associated with a mismatch in asset and liability maturities, including an undue reliance on short-term debt funding, which may increase debt rollover risk. The Liquidity Guidance AB permits an FHLBank to temporarily decrease its liquidity position, in a safe and sound manner, below the stated regulatory levels, as necessary for providing unanticipated extensions of advances to members or draws on letters of credit to beneficiaries. The Bank has met this liquidity requirement as directed by the Finance Agency throughout the third quarter of 2024.

Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of net cash provided by (used in) the Bank s operating, investing, and financing activities (dollars in millions): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 14 640 Investing activities 17,499 (11,244) Financing activities (17,621) 10,506 Net change in cash and due from banks (108) (98) 
 
 The primary drivers that can impact net operating cash flows are fluctuations in net income and changes in certain adjustments to net income which may include amortization, accretion, derivative and hedging activities, and other adjustments. 
 
 The Bank recorded net income of 521 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net income of 475 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Bank recorded net accretion of million and of million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily driven by changes in interest rates related to consolidated obligation discount notes. 
 
 The Bank recorded a net negative change of million in derivative and hedging activities for the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net positive change of million in derivative and hedging activities for the same period in 2023. The change in derivative and hedging activities was primarily driven by the change in interest rates. 
 
 The Bank recorded a positive change of million and a negative change of million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, in accrued interest receivable. The change in accrued interest receivable was primarily driven by lower advance balances for the first nine months of 2024 compared the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Bank recorded a negative change of million and a positive change of million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, in accrued interest payable. The change in accrued interest payable was primarily driven by the changes in interest rates related to consolidated obligations. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities fluctuate primarily based on advances and investing activities. 
 
 The Bank originated a total of 233.4 billion of advances and collected 243.8 billion of advances principal for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 390.4 billion and 391.6 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Bank purchased investment securities of 3.1 billion and received proceeds from principal collected of 3.5 billion during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7.5 billion and 3.5 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2023. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the Bank recorded a net change of positive 6.7 billion related to liquidity investments compared to a net change of negative 8.4 billion for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities fluctuate primarily based on the issuance and payments for maturing and retiring consolidated obligations. 
 
 The Bank issued 230.2 billion in consolidated obligations and paid 248.0 billion for maturing and retiring consolidated obligations for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 361.5 billion and 351.8 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2023. 

Anticipated Cash Expenditures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the Bank s anticipated cash expenditures, as reported in the Bank s Form 10-K.

Off-balance Sheet Commitments 
 
 The Bank s primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows: 
 
 the Bank s joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and 
 
 the Bank s outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit. 
 Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, can be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the other FHLBanks had defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of joint and several obligation has been fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks consolidated obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the FHLBanks had 1,172.8 billion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, 125.2 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations. 
 The Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate additional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis. 
 Commitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank s potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management s credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for unfunded standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 Refer to Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank s interim financial statements for more information about the Bank s outstanding standby letters of credit. 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this Report not previously disclosed are summarized below. 
 
 Finance Agency s Review and Analysis of the FHLBank System. On November 7, 2023, the Finance Agency issued a written report titled FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future, (System at 100 Report) presenting its review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations it plans to pursue in service of its vision for the future of the FHLBank System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLBank System; (2) the FHLBank System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLBank System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. The Finance Agency has stated that it expects to continue a multi-year collaborative effort with the FHLBanks, their member institutions, and other stakeholders to address the recommended actions in the System at 100 Report and has stated that it can implement some of the recommendations from the report through ongoing supervision, guidance, or rulemaking, as well as through statutory changes by proposing specific requests for Congressional action. The Finance Agency made legislative recommendations for the FHLBank System in its 2023 Report to Congress issued on June 14, 2024 consistent with proposed plans and actions included in the System at 100 Report. Other significant regulatory actions for the FHLBanks are discussed in this section. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin 2024-03 on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management. On September 27, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of proper escalation policies, processes for coordination with 
 45 

Table of Contents 

members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. The Bank is evaluating this advisory bulletin versus its current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on the Bank, its operations and its members. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin AB 2024- 04 Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management. On September 30, 2024, the Finance Agency issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the Finance Agency s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of this advisory bulletin on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks. On October 3, 2024, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024 to amend the Finance Agency s regulation on capital requirements Capital Regulation to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts IBDAs in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit (more restrictive) on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations, and clarify that certain unsecured non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered towards Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to the Bank s current business processes. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on FHLBank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management. On October 21, 2024, the Finance Agency proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact Bank director compensation by allowing the Director of the Finance Agency to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require the Bank to complete and submit background checks to the Finance Agency on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact Bank public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all Bank independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing Bank directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, Bank conflicts of interest policies, covering all Bank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practices, several of the proposed revisions, if adopted, could result in significant changes to the nomination, election, and retention of the Bank s board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation could hinder the Bank s ability to recruit and retain talent and expertise which are critical to the Bank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 The Bank continues to monitor the Finance Agency s efforts to implement the recommendations from the System at a 100 Report and the Bank is not able to predict what actions will ultimately result, the timing or extent of any actions or changes, or the ultimate effect on the Bank or the FHLBank System in the future. The Bank plans to continue to engage with the Finance Agency and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure that the FHLBank System remains well positioned to serve the Bank s members and their communities. For a further discussion of the System at 100 Report, including proposed plans and actions, and related risks, see, respectively, Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments and Item 1A Risk Factors, each included in the Bank s Form 10-K. 
 
 The Bank continues to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on the Bank.

Risk Management 
 
 The Bank s lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank s strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank s risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank s business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank s desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations; and (2) achieve best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank s strategic and tactical planning, as described in the Bank s Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk 
 
 The Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets. 
 
 Advances 
 
 Secured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank s credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral. 
 The Bank determines credit risk ratings for its members by evaluating each institution s overall financial health, taking into account the quality of assets, earnings, liquidity, and capital position. The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insured depository institution a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 by utilizing an internal model (101 being the least amount of credit risk and 104 the greatest amount of credit risk). The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insurance company a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 by utilizing an external model. The Bank assigns each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or an insurance company (including housing associates, community development financial institutions, and corporate credit unions) a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 based on an internal risk matrix developed for each entity type. 
 In general, borrowers with the greatest amount of credit risk may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank s assessment of a borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. Management and the board also monitor the Bank s concentration in secured credit and standby letters of credit exposure to individual borrowers.

Table of Contents 

The following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions). 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Rating Number of Borrowers Par Value of Outstanding Advances Number of Borrowers Par Value of Outstanding Advances 101 295 66,510 323 84,969 102 45 19,157 51 11,577 103 15 816 14 318 104 2 30 3 84 Unrated 1 Total 358 86,513 391 96,948 
 The Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower s general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower s overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower s total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower s total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more than 30 percent. However, the Bank s board of directors may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral, reporting, and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, however, none of these borrowers exceeded the 30 percent credit usage as of September 30, 2024, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was 14.4 billion and 29 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower s outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. The Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value equal to or greater than its outstanding extension of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank s advances (dollars in millions). 
 Total Par Value of Outstanding Advances LCV of Collateral Pledged by Members First Mortgage Collateral ) Securities Collateral ) Other Real Estate Related Collateral ) As of September 30, 2024 86,513 404,919 57.71 20.14 22.15 As of December 31, 2023 96,948 392,828 60.22 17.89 21.89 
 For purposes of determining each member s LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member s default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to provide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank. 
 
 The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law. Most members provide the Bank with a blanket lien covering substantially all of the member s real estate-related assets and their consent for the Bank to file a financing statement evidencing the blanket lien. The Bank requires delivery of cash and securities pledged to the Bank as collateral. Delivery of loan collateral is also required when pledged by insurance company, community development financial institution, or housing associate members. For most commercial bank and credit union members, delivery of loan collateral is not required. The Bank periodically works 
 48 

Table of Contents 

with commercial bank and credit union members to release collateral from the Bank s lien to permit such members to pledge those assets to support borrowings, or potential borrowings, from the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. 
 In its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank s policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Investments 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk on investments consisting of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. The Finance Agency defines investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing, so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected, and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. 
 In addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties. 
 Finance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities: 
 
 instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; 
 
 instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; 
 
 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; 
 
 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank s mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; 
 
 interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs); 
 
 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; 
 
 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and 
 
 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. 
 
 Finance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on NRSRO ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank s Risk Management Policy (RMP) and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank s counterparties. These reports are reviewed by the Bank s board of directors. In addition to the Bank s RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank s overall investment opportunities.

The Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty s parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank s gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (dollars in millions).

 The Bank s unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties was 10.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Bayerische Landesbank (Germany), SEB AB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) (Sweden), and Svenska Handelsbanken (Sweden) each represented greater than 10 percent and collectively represented 38.7 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, total unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities. 
 
 The Bank s RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. government or any U.S. government agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by U.S. agencies; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which typically have the highest ratings issued by S P or Moody s at the time of purchase. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance, marketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.

 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. 
 
 Available-for-sale Securities 
 
 Available-for-sale securities are evaluated at the individual security level for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the security s fair value to its amortized cost. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the Statements of Condition. Impairment exists when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost (i.e., in an unrealized loss position). In assessing whether a credit loss exists on an impaired security, the Bank considers whether there would be a shortfall in receiving all cash flows contractually due. In the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit U.S. government guarantee and GSE securities are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs. When a shortfall is considered possible, the Bank compares the present value of cash flows to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than amortized cost, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision (reversal) for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount of the unrealized loss. The allowance for credit losses excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately. If management intends to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before expected recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses is written off and the amortized cost basis is written down to the security s fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. If management does not intend to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale and it is not more likely than not that management will be required to sell the debt security, then the credit portion of the difference is recognized as an allowance for credit losses and any remaining difference between the security s fair value and amortized cost is recorded as net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities within other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank has not established an allowance for credit loss on any of its available-for-sale sale securities as of September 30, 2024.

Held-to-maturity Securities 
 
 Held-to-maturity securities are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses on a pool basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. If applicable, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding credit loss expense (or reversal of credit loss expense). The allowance for credit losses excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately. 
 
 The Bank evaluates its held-to-maturity securities for impairment on a collective, or pooled basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. The Bank has not established an allowance for credit loss on any of its held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 because the securities: (1) were all highly-rated and/or had short remaining terms to maturity, (2) had not experienced, nor did the Bank expect, any payment default on the instruments and (3) in the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit U.S. government guarantee, and (4) in the case of GSE securities, they are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs. 

Derivatives 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations. 
 
 The Bank s over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a clearing agent with a Clearinghouse. Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the derivative transaction is novated, and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty. 
 
 For uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank s exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result, the Bank does not expect any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Uncleared derivative transactions executed on or after the dates specified in applicable regulations are subject to two-way initial margin requirements as mandated by the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, if the Bank s aggregate uncleared derivative transactions exposure to a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold. The initial margin is required to be held at a third-party custodian and does not change ownership. Rather, the party in respect of which the initial margin has been posted to the third-party custodian will have a security interest in the amount of initial margin required under the uncleared margin rules and can only take ownership upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding. 
 
 For cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. This does introduce, however, a risk of concentration among the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank s Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank currently utilized two approved Clearinghouses, CME Clearing and LCH Ltd. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilateral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank s daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has two approved clearing agents, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. The Bank does not expect any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the Bank s interim financial statements for more information about cleared derivatives.

Table of Contents 

The contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank s maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions, is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.

Mortgage Loan Programs 
 
 The Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the Mortgage Purchase Program (MPP) and the Mortgage Partnership Finance Program (MPF Program or MPF) by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the participating financial institutions. 
 The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was not material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk that are included in the Bank s Form 10-K. The information provided herein is intended to update the disclosures made in the Bank s Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank s assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of the Bank s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the component of market risk having the greatest effect on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations is interest-rate risk. A description of the Bank s management of interest-rate risk is contained in the Bank s Form 10-K. 
 
 The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk management objectives.

Interest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement 
 
 The Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank s interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration. 
 
 Bank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of plus five years to minus five years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of plus seven years to minus seven years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years). 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Down 200 Basis Points Current Up 200 Basis Points Down 200 Basis Points Current Up 200 Basis Points Assets 0.19 0.20 0.27 0.17 0.17 0.24 Liabilities 0.14 0.12 0.11 0.13 0.12 0.10 Equity 1.03 1.53 3.23 0.92 1.20 2.97 Effective duration gap 0.05 0.08 0.16 0.04 0.05 0.14 
 
 The Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a pricing approach that is more fully described in Note 11 Estimated Fair Values to the Bank s interim financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest-rate changes. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (dollars in millions). 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Down 200 Basis Points Current Up 200 Basis Points Down 200 Basis Points Current Up 200 Basis Points Assets 136,398 135,912 135,282 153,624 153,132 152,509 Liabilities 128,823 128,498 128,211 145,932 145,574 145,253 Equity 7,575 7,414 7,071 7,692 7,558 7,256 
 
 The scenarios above generally include numerous assumptions, including those related to changes in the balance sheet, interest rates, and prepayment trends. Such assumptions may change through time as a result of a host of factors, including changes in the balance sheet as well as the interest-rate environment. The modeling process is performed in a manner consistent with the Bank s policies and procedures with results reviewed on an on-going basis by the Bank. While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest-rate sensitivity of the Bank, market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the Bank s assets, liabilities and equity.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Bank s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Certifying Officers) are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s management, with the participation of the Certifying Officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(a) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (1) is accumulated and communicated to the Certifying Officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (2) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 
 
 In designing and evaluating the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures, the Certifying Officers recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, there were no changes in the Bank s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 The Bank may be subject to various legal proceedings and actions from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of those matters presently known to the Bank will have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Bank s Form 10-K, should be carefully considered as they could materially affect the Bank s business, financial condition, and operating results. The risks described in the Bank s Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Bank. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Bank or that the Bank currently deems to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect the Bank s business, financial condition, and operating results.
