The million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan are both subject to the approval of Kirkland's shareholders at the Company s special meeting of shareholders on December 23, 2024 Special Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules and other customary closing conditions.

million and net cash used in operating activities of million compared to a net loss of million and net cash used in operating activities of million in the prior year period. When conditions and events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management evaluates the mitigating effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within the assessment period and, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions and events to alleviate substantial doubt. The Company s plans are focused on improving its operating results and liquidity through sales growth, cost reductions and additional financing. Throughout fiscal 2024, the Company implemented expense reductions to streamline its cost structure and improve its liquidity profile. The Company believes these actions are necessary as part of improving its profitability and liquidity trajectory, while minimizing any disruption to the Company s focus on its strategic initiatives and the overall customer experience. The cost-savings initiatives included a reduction in corporate overhead, store payroll, marketing and third-party technology expenses. In addition, through the strategic partnership with Beyond, the Company received proceeds of million from the Beyond Credit Agreement, which were used by the Company to repay the outstanding balance on the FILO Term Loan, to pay prepayment fees and transaction expenses, and to reduce borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. If the million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan are both approved at the Special Shareholders Meeting, the Company will receive additional proceeds of million, and the Convertible Term Loan will convert to equity. If these provisions are not approved, the Company will consider additional cost reductions and financing options. The Company believes these plans and arrangements will result in adequate cash flows to support its ongoing operations and to meet its covenant requirements for one year following the date these financial statements are issued. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its plans will be successful, and if the Company encounters unforeseen circumstances that place further constraints on its capital resources, management will be required to take various additional measures to conserve liquidity. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments or charges that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, such as charges related to impairment of the Company s assets, the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or other similar adjustments.

Deferred e-commerce revenue E-commerce revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete, as the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations. Deferred revenue related to e-commerce orders that have been shipped but not estimated to be received by customers included in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets was approximately million, million and million at November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. The related contract assets, reflected in inventories, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, totaled approximately , and at November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. Gift cards Gift card sales are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. While the Company honors all gift cards presented for payment, the Company determines the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain gift card balances due to long periods of inactivity. The Company uses the redemption recognition method to account for breakage for unused gift card amounts where breakage is recognized as gift cards are redeemed for the purchase of goods based upon a historical breakage rate. In these circumstances, to the extent the Company determines there is no requirement for remitting unredeemed card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, such amounts are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of net sales. 

The table below sets forth selected gift card breakage and redemption information (in thousands) for the periods indicated:

Revolving Line of Credit On March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2023 Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and lender. The 2023 Credit Agreement amended the previous Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2019 Credit Agreement from a million senior secured revolving credit facility to a million senior secured revolving credit facility. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains substantially similar terms and conditions as the 2019 Credit Agreement including a swingline availability of million, a million incremental accordion feature and extended its maturity date to . basis points when usage is greater than 50 of the facility amount; otherwise, the fee on the unused portion is basis points per annum. On January 25, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement that increased the advance rate and allowed the Company to enter into the FILO Term Loan (defined below) agreement. Subsequent to January 25, 2024, advances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a margin of basis points with no SOFR floor. Upon the demonstration that the Company s fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to on a trailing twelve-month basis, the interest rate permanently decreases on the 2023 Credit Agreement to SOFR plus a margin of basis points. Prior to January 25, 2024, advances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrued interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus a margin ranging from to basis points with no SOFR floor. On October 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement to permit the Beyond Credit Agreement and the Subscription Agreement and to modify the borrowing base calculation and the minimum excess availability covenant. The interest rate and expiration date provisions of the First Amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement remained unchanged. The Company is subject to a Third Amended and Restated Security Agreement Security Agreement with its lenders. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company pledged and granted to the administrative agent, for the benefit of itself and the secured parties specified therein, a lien on and security interest in all of the rights, title and interest in substantially all of the Company s assets to secure the payment and performance of the obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement. The maximum availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement is limited by a borrowing base formula, which consists of a percentage of eligible inventory and eligible credit card receivables, less reserves and an excess required availability covenant, which limits the borrowing base formula by the greater of of the combined borrowing base formula or million. As of November 2, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants in the 2023 Credit Agreement and there were no letters of credit outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement. As of November 2, 2024 , the Company has approximately million available for borrowing under the 2023 Credit Agreement, after the minimum required excess availability covenant. Availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement fluctuates largely based on eligible inventory levels, and as eligible inventory increases in the second and third fiscal quarters in support of the Company s back-half sales plans, the Company s borrowing capacity increases correspondingly. Subsequent to November 2, 2024 , the Company repaid a net million under the 2023 Credit Agreement. FILO Term Loan On January 25, 2024, the Company entered into a million first-in, last-out asset-based delayed-draw term loan (the FILO Term Loan with Gordon Brothers Group, via an affiliate entity, 1903P Loan Agent, LLC, as administrative agent and lender. The indebtedness under the FILO Term Loan was subordinated in most respects to the 2023 Credit Agreement. The FILO Term Loan had a maturity date of March 2028, coterminous with the 2023 Credit Agreement. The interest rate of the FILO Term Loan was one-month term SOFR, plus a margin of .

 million, which consisted of million of debt principal and million of prepayment penalties. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the FILO Term Loan of million during the 13-weeks ended November 2, 2024, of which million was for the prepayment penalty and the remainder was related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Beyond Credit Agreement On October 21, 2024, the Company entered into the Beyond Credit Agreement with Beyond, as administrative agent and lender. The Beyond Credit Agreement consists of an million Convertible Term Loan that is mandatorily convertible into Kirkland s common stock at a price of per share for a total of shares upon the approval of Kirkland s shareholders and an million Non-Convertible Term Loan that is non-convertible. The maturity date on the Non-Convertible Term Loan is September 30, 2028, and the maturity date on the Convertible Term Loan is days from the closing of the Beyond Credit Agreement, or if shareholder approval is not obtained, the maturity date will be extended to September 30, 2028. Beyond can elect to convert a portion of the Convertible Term Loan into shares of Kirkland s common stock prior to shareholder approval up to a cap of shares. The indebtedness under the Beyond Credit Agreement is subordinated to the 2023 Credit Agreement and is not subject to a borrowing base calculation. The Beyond Credit Agreement accrues interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus a margin of basis points with no SOFR floor. As of November 2, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants in the Beyond Credit Agreement. Collaboration Agreement Fees The Company entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Beyond, which outlines the parties intentions to collaborate on numerous operating arrangements. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Kirkland s will pay Beyond a quarterly collaboration fee equal to of Kirkland s quarterly retail and e-commerce revenue starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and continuing for the remaining seven-year term of the Collaboration Agreement. This fee will extend an additional two years beyond the Collaboration Agreement if the Beyond Credit Agreement is still outstanding as of the expiration or termination of the Collaboration Agreement. Kirkland s will also pay to Beyond an incentive fee equal to of Kirkland s incremental growth in e-commerce revenue during the term of the Collaboration Agreement. As payments are remitted to Beyond from the Company, the balance of the liability related to the sale of a percentage of future revenue will be repaid over the life of the Collaboration Agreement. In order to determine the amortization of the liability, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future payments to Beyond over the life of the Collaboration Agreement. The million initial liability will be accreted to the total of the payments as interest expense over the life of the Collaboration Agreement. At execution, the estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately . This estimate contains significant assumptions that impact both the amount recorded at execution and the interest expense that will be recognized over the Collaboration Agreement period. The Company will periodically assess the estimated payments to Beyond and to the extent the amount or timing of such fees is materially different than the original estimates, an adjustment will be recorded prospectively to increase or decrease interest expense. The main factor that could materially affect the amount of the payments is changes in the Company s estimated retail and e-commerce revenue. General Terms and Conditions Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Beyond Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions and contain customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to make payments, a cross-default to certain other debt, breaches of covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, a change in control, certain monetary judgments and bankruptcy and ERISA events. Upon any such event of default, the principal amount of any unpaid loans and all other obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Beyond Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.

If the million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan are both approved at the Special Shareholders Meeting, the Company will receive additional proceeds of million, and the Convertible Term Loan will convert to equity. After the million equity purchase and the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan, Beyond would own approximately of Kirkland s then outstanding common stock. Pursuant to an investor rights agreement, Beyond is subject to a standstill obligation, that among other things, generally restricts Beyond s ability to acquire more than of the Company s stock.

 Strategic Partnership with Beyond 
 We entered into a strategic partnership with Beyond on October 21, 2024, with the purposes of enabling cohesive collaboration between the companies, leveraging the strengths of each business to drive sustainable profitable growth and value for all stakeholders. As part of this partnership with Beyond, we entered into the Beyond Credit Agreement, Subscription Agreement, Collaboration Agreement and Trademark License Agreement. Proceeds of 17 million from the Beyond Credit Agreement, in the form of an 8.5 Non-Convertible Term Loan and an 8.5 million Convertible Term Loan were used by us to repay our existing FILO Term Loan, including prepayment fees and transaction expenses, and to reduce borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. The 8 million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan are both subject to the approval of our shareholders at our Special Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules and other customary closing conditions. For further discussion on the agreements with Beyond, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation , Note 5 Fair Value Measures , Note 9 Long-Term Debt and Note 10 Subscription Agreement . 
 Challenging Macroeconomic Conditions 
 The macroeconomic environment in which we operate remains uncertain as a result of numerous factors, including inflationary pressures, high interest rates, declines in consumer spending behavior and aggressive promotional activity. These negative macroeconomic factors have impacted our business, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity levels over the last several fiscal quarters. They have also made it difficult to execute our strategic initiatives, including our financial turnaround strategy. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding our plans to mitigate these factors. 
 For additional information regarding risks related to macroeconomics, liquidity and strategy and strategy execution, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report. 
 Key Financial Measures 
 Net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers of our operating performance. Net sales consists of all merchandise sales to customers, net of returns, shipping revenue associated with e-commerce sales, gift card breakage revenue, revenue earned from our private label credit card program and excludes sales taxes. Gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales. Cost of sales has five distinct components: merchandise costs (including product costs, inbound freight expenses, inventory shrink and damages), store occupancy costs, outbound freight costs (including both store and e-commerce shipping expenses), central distribution costs and depreciation of store and distribution center assets. Merchandise and outbound freight costs are variable, while occupancy and central distribution costs are largely fixed. Accordingly, gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance. 
 We use comparable sales to measure sales increases and decreases from stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months, including our online sales. We remove closed stores from our comparable sales calculation the day after the stores close. Relocated stores remain in our comparable sales calculation. E-commerce sales, including shipping revenue, are included in comparable sales. Increases in comparable sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing our profitability. 
 Operating expenses, including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters, are also an important component of our operating performance. Compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses. Operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs, and managing the operating expense ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales) is an important focus of management as we seek to increase our overall profitability. Operating expenses include cash costs as well as non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization associated with omni-channel technology, corporate property and equipment, and impairment of long-lived assets. Because many operating expenses are fixed costs, and because operating costs tend to rise over time, increases in comparable sales typically are necessary to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio. Operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one-time or non-recurring nature. While these costs must be considered to fully understand our operating performance, we typically identify such costs separately where significant in the consolidated statements of operations so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods.

20.1 

Net sales. Net sales decreased 1.7 to 114.4 million for the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to 116.4 million for the prior year period. Comparable sales decreased 3.0 , or 3.5 million, for the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. For the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, e-commerce comparable sales decreased 14.9 compared to the prior year period, and store comparable sales increased 1.6 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in comparable sales was driven by a decrease in consolidated average ticket and a decline in e-commerce conversion, which was partially offset by higher consolidated traffic and store conversion. Comparable sales performance was also negatively impacted by approximately 1.0 related to hurricane disruptions across a significant portion of the store base. Merchandise categories performing below prior period levels include furniture, mirrors, art and ornamental wall d cor, while gift, fragrance and floral performed above prior period levels. 
 Gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points from 26.3 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 28.1 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. The overall increase in gross profit margin was due to favorable distribution center costs,

Table of Contents 

 outbound freight costs, and depreciation, partially offset by unfavorable merchandise margin and store occupancy costs. Distribution center costs decreased 130 basis points to 4.8 of net sales due to improved levels of cost capitalization in inventory in the current year period due to a later inventory increase compared to the prior year quarter. Outbound freight costs, including both store and e-commerce shipping expenses, decreased approximately 120 basis points to 6.8 of net sales due to the decline in shipping expense related to the decrease in e-commerce sales and improved management of store routes and rate reductions. Depreciation of store and distribution center assets decreased approximately 20 basis points to 1.3 of net sales in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Merchandise margin decreased approximately 50 basis points from 54.0 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 53.5 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, mainly due to increased promotional activity and to a lesser extent, higher inbound freight costs. Store occupancy costs increased approximately 40 basis points to 12.5 of net sales due to the sales deleverage on these fixed costs. 
 Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 17.0 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2023 and the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher store bonus and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by reductions in corporate compensation and benefits costs. 
 Other operating expenses . Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 130 basis points from 13.8 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 12.5 in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to reduced advertising costs. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt, related to the payoff of our FILO Term Loan, was 3.3 million in the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, of which 2.6 million was related to a prepayment penalty and the remainder was for the write-off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. 
 Income tax expense (benefit). We recorded an income tax expense of approximately 356,000, or (4.9) of the loss before income taxes, during the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of approximately 1.3 million, or 16.8 of the loss before income taxes, during the prior year period. The change in the tax rate for the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to changes in valuation allowance adjustments and state income taxes. 
 Net loss and loss per share. We reported net loss of 7.7 million, or a loss of 0.59 per diluted share, for the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2024 as compared to net loss of 6.4 million, or a loss of 0.50 per diluted share, for the third 13 weeks of fiscal 2023.

Net sales. Net sales decreased 3.4 to 292.5 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to 302.7 million for the prior year period. Comparable sales decreased 2.7 , or 8.2 million, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. For the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, e-commerce comparable sales decreased 15.0 compared to the prior year period, and store comparable sales increased 2.0 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in comparable sales was driven by a decrease in consolidated average ticket and a decline in online conversion, which was partially offset by higher consolidated traffic and store conversion. Merchandise categories performing below prior period levels include furniture, mirrors, ornamental wall d cor, art, lamps and outdoor textiles, while gift, floral and holiday d cor performed above prior period levels. 
 Gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 190 basis points from 24.4 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 26.3 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024. The overall increase in gross profit margin was due to favorable outbound freight costs, distribution center costs, merchandise margin and depreciation, partially offset by unfavorable store occupancy costs. Outbound freight costs, including both store and e-commerce shipping expenses, decreased approximately 120 basis points to 6.7 of net sales due to the decline in shipping expense related to the decrease in e-commerce sales, improved management of store routes and rate reductions. Distribution center costs decreased approximately 70 basis points to 5.3 of net sales due to increased efficiency and a smooth inventory flow which led to lower compensation and benefits costs and lower fixed costs due to the closure of two e-commerce fulfillment location in the prior year period. Merchandise margin increased approximately 30 basis points from 54.1 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 54.4 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, mainly due to a higher initial product markup and favorable shrink and damages. Depreciation of store and distribution center assets decreased approximately 30 basis points to 1.6 of net sales in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Store occupancy costs increased approximately 60 basis points to 14.5 of net sales due to the sales deleverage on these fixed costs. 
 Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 10 basis points from 19.5 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 19.6 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, primarily due to sales deleverage of higher store payroll costs, partially offset by reductions in corporate compensation costs. 
 Other operating expenses . Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 110 basis points from 14.8 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 to 13.7 in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to reduced advertising costs, partially offset by increased consulting costs for strategic advisory services. In addition, we received a state tax refund due to a recent change in state tax law that offset operating expenses in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt, related to the payoff of our FILO Term Loan, was 3.3 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, of which 2.6 million was related to a prepayment penalty and the remainder was for the write-off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs. 
 Income tax expense. We recorded income tax expense of approximately 549,000, or (1.8) of the loss before income taxes, during the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, compared to an income tax expense of approximately 720,000, or (1.9) of the loss before income taxes, during the prior year period. The change in the tax rate for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to changes in valuation allowance adjustments and state income taxes. 
 Net loss and loss per share. We reported net loss of 31.0 million, or a loss of 2.38 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 as compared to net loss of 37.9 million, or a loss of 2.95 per diluted share, for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating loss, adjusted net loss and adjusted diluted loss per share. These measures are not in accordance with, and are not intended as alternatives to, GAAP financial measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe that they provide useful information to analysts and investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operational performance. 
 We define EBITDA as net loss before interest and the provision for income tax, which is equivalent to operating loss, adjusted for depreciation and asset impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to remove stock-based compensation expense, due to the non-cash nature of this expense, to remove severance, as it fluctuates based on the needs of the business and does not represent a normal recurring operating expense, and to remove any financing related legal or professional fees not subject to capitalization. Adjusted operating loss is defined as adjusted EBITDA including depreciation. We define adjusted net loss as net loss adjusted for stock compensation, severance, any financing related legal or professional fees not subject to capitalization and the loss on extinguishment of 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 debt, due to either the non-recurring or non-cash nature of these expenses and the related tax adjustments. We define adjusted loss per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted share count. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meanings prescribed by GAAP. Use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Each non-GAAP financial measure has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of operating loss to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss and a reconciliation of net loss and diluted loss per share to adjusted net loss and adjusted diluted loss per share (in thousands, except for share data) for the periods indicated:

(3) The costs incurred during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 2, 2024, include consulting and legal fees relating to the Company s transaction with Beyond that, due to their nature, were not capitalized as deferred debt or equity issuance costs. Given the magnitude and scope of this strategic transaction, which is not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, the Company considers the incremental consulting and legal fees incurred not reflective of the ongoing costs to operate its business. 

(4) Severance charges include expenses related to severance agreements and permanent store closure compensation costs. 

(5) Loss on extinguishment of debt includes expenses related to the extinguishment of the FILO Term Loan including a 2.6 million prepayment penalty and the write-off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal capital requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures. Working capital consists mainly of merchandise inventories offset by accounts payable, which typically reach their peak by the early portion of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Capital expenditures primarily relate to existing store maintenance, refreshes and remodels, technology and omni-channel projects, and new or relocated stores. Historically, we have funded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated cash and borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility. 
 In fiscal 2023, we entered into the FILO Term Loan to provide additional liquidity, as internally generated cash and borrowings under our existing asset-based revolving credit facility did not provide enough liquidity to effectively execute our financial turnaround strategy in fiscal 2024. Throughout fiscal 2024, we implemented expense reductions to streamline our cost structure and improve our liquidity profile. The cost-savings initiatives included a reduction in corporate overhead, store payroll, marketing and third-party technology expenses. On October 21, 2024, we entered into the Beyond Credit Agreement and Subscription Agreement. We believe these actions are necessary as part of improving our profitability and liquidity trajectory, while minimizing any disruption to our focus on our strategic initiatives and the overall customer experience. As part of this partnership, Beyond is investing 25 million in us through a combined debt and equity transaction. Proceeds of 17 million from the Beyond Credit Agreement were used by us to repay our FILO Term Loan, including prepayment fees and transaction expenses, and to reduce borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. The 8 million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory conversion of the Beyond Convertible Term Loan are both subject to the approval of Kirkland's shareholders at the Company s Special Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules and other customary closing conditions. 
 We believe that the combination of our cash balances, cash flow from operations, availability under our 2023 Credit Agreement and the aforementioned expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for one year following the date these financial statements are issued. However, we cannot provide any assurance that our plans will be successful, and if we encounter unforeseen circumstances that place further constraints on our capital resources, we will be required to take various additional measures to conserve liquidity. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments or charges that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern, such as charges related to impairment of our assets, the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or other similar adjustments. 
 Cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 39.0 million and 42.7 million during the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 and the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities depend heavily on operating performance and changes in working capital. The decrease in the amount of cash used in operations as compared to the prior year period was mainly due to improved operating results, partially offset by a decline in working capital. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 consisted primarily of 1.7 million in capital expenditures as compared to 3.3 million in capital expenditures for the prior year period. The table below sets forth capital expenditures by category (in thousands) for the periods indicated:

 Cash flows from financing activities. During the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 43.6 million, as we borrowed 17.0 million under our Beyond Credit Agreement and borrowed a net 31.0 million under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by prepayment penalties payments of 2.6 million and 1.7 million of debt and equity issuance cost payments. During the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 46.5 million, as we borrowed a net 47.0 million under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by 0.5 million of debt issuance cost payments.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of borrowings under our long-term debt agreements, as discussed in Note 9 Long-Term Debt, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, which bear interest based on variable rates. 
 We manage cash and cash equivalents in various institutions at levels beyond federally insured limits per institution, and we may purchase investments not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will not recover the full principal of our investments or that their liquidity may be diminished. 
 We were not engaged in any foreign exchange contracts, hedges, interest rate swaps, derivatives or other financial instruments as of November 2, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . Both our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), after the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was performed by management with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of November 2, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Change in internal controls over financial reporting . There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 For a description of the Company s legal proceedings, refer to Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 The risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, our business, and the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in the Annual Report, except for the updates set forth below regarding the transaction with Beyond. The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 We may not be able to consummate all elements of the Beyond transaction or satisfy all of the conditions precedent to consummation of the proposed transaction. 
 We entered into a strategic partnership with Beyond on October 21, 2024, with the purpose of enabling cohesive collaboration between the companies, leveraging the strengths of each business to drive sustainable profitable growth and value for all stakeholders. As part of this partnership, Beyond is investing 25 million in us through a combined debt and equity transaction. Proceeds of 17 million from the Beyond Credit Agreement were used by us to repay our existing FILO Term Loan, including prepayment fees and transaction expenses, and to reduce borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. The 8 million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement and the mandatory debt conversion of the Convertible Term Loan are both subject to the approval of Kirkland's shareholders at the Company s Special Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules and other customary closing conditions. If our shareholders do not approve the mandatory conversion of the Convertible Term Loan under the Beyond Credit Agreement and the 8 million equity purchase under the Subscription Agreement, it would have a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition. 
 We might not be able to obtain various synergies as contemplated in the Collaboration Agreement. 
 Our ability to obtain the various synergies envisioned in the Collaboration Agreement is dependent on successfully identifying, developing and implementing plans and initiatives intended to drive such synergies. If such plans and initiatives are not properly identified, developed and successfully executed, or if execution or realization of positive synergies takes longer than expected, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully open and operate Bed Bath Beyond retail stores under the Trademark License Agreement, which grants us the exclusive license to operate small format, neighborhood brick-and-mortar stores under licensed Beyond-owned trademarks. If we do open and operate the stores, there can be no assurance that they will be profitable. The success of our plans and initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to execution, market conditions, customer acceptance and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially, and adversely, from our plans or expected results. 
 In addition, our ability to successfully market our products to Beyond s customers and to grow our customer base might not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we can realize additional opportunities for growth and innovation through this partnership. Further, we could lose current customers because of this partnership by alienating our current customer base, which could negatively impact our operating performance. 
 There might be unintended and unanticipated negative side effects related to the Beyond transaction. 
 The announcement or pendency of the Beyond transaction could have a negative impact on the Company s business relationships, operating results and business generally. The Special Shareholders Meeting, or any other component of the Beyond transaction, could divert management s attention from ongoing business operations. Also, there could be unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction. Finally, there could be potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction against the Company or the Company s directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto. Any one of these risks could negatively impact our operating performance and liquidity.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
 On January 6, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan providing for the purchase in the aggregate of up to 30.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. Repurchases of shares are made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in the open market or negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases are based on a variety of factors, including stock price, regulator limitations and other market and economic factors. The share repurchase plans do not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the Company may terminate the repurchase plans at any time. For the 39-week period ended November 2, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock under the share repurchase plan. As of November 2, 2024, the Company had approximately 26.3 million remaining under the current share repurchase plan.
