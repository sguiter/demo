CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere herein, with respect to our financial condition, results of operations
and business that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as anticipate , believe , expect , plan ,
 intend , seek , estimate , project , could , may or the
negative thereof or other variations thereon, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. Management wishes to
caution the reader of the forward-looking statements that any such statements that are contained in this report reflect our current beliefs
with respect to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, economic,
competitive, regulatory, technological, key employees, and general business factors affecting our operations, markets, growth, services,
products and other factors, some of which are described in this report and some of which are discussed in our other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements are only estimates or predictions. No assurances can be given regarding
the achievement of future results, as actual results may differ materially as a result of risks facing our company, and actual events
may differ from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made regarding anticipated events. 

Important
factors to consider in evaluating any forward-looking statements include: 

our
 ability to finance and complete the design and construction of our proposed data center operations; 

our
 ability to implement our business plan; 

our
 ability to attract key personnel; 

our
 ability to operate profitably; 

our
 ability to efficiently and effectively finance our operations; 

inability
 to achieve future sales levels or other operating results; 

inability
 to raise additional financing for working capital; 

inability
 to efficiently manage our operations; 

the
 inability of management to effectively implement our strategies and business plans; 

the
 unavailability of funds for capital expenditures and/or general working capital; 

the
 fact that our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations,
 and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain; 

deterioration
 in general or regional economic conditions; 

changes
 in U.S. GAAP or in the legal, regulatory and legislative environments in the markets in which we operate; 

adverse
 state or federal legislation or regulation that increases the costs of compliance, or adverse findings by a regulator with respect
 to existing operations; 

These
risk factors should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting
on our behalf may issue. All written and oral forward looking statements made in connection with this report that are attributable to
our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given these uncertainties,
we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts 
expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 

Notwithstanding
the above, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), expressly state that the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
does not apply to companies that issue penny stock. If, as now, we are considered to be an issuer of penny stock, the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements may not apply to us at certain times. 

Throughout
this report, unless otherwise designated, the terms we, us, our, the Company 
and our company refer to CalEthos, Inc., a Nevada corporation. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise indicated.

CalEthos, Inc. 

 Notes to the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

million
shares of common stock. At the date of incorporation, shares were issued to the Company for Korean Won, or approximately
 , for ownership of AIQ. As of July 2022, AIQ was placed into a dormant state of operations. 

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 as of September 30, 2024 and had recurring revenue from operations. The Company has financed its activities principally
through debt and equity financing and shareholder contributions. Management expects to incur additional losses and cash outflows in the
foreseeable future in connection with its operating activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage companies, including dependence on key individuals; successful
development, marketing and branding of services; the uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues; dependence on outside
sources of financing; risks associated with research and development; dependence on third-party suppliers and collaborators; protection
of intellectual property; and competition with larger, better-capitalized companies. Ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations
is dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fund the Company s operations and generating a level of
revenues adequate to support the Company s cost structure. 

The
Company will need to raise debt or equity financing in the future in order to continue its operations and achieve its growth targets.
However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, when and if needed,
or at all. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number
of factors, including the development of the Company s data center campus, approvals for construction permits, construction times,
delivery of critical equipment, market demand for the Company s wholesale colocation data center services, the timing of customer
commitments for data center space, the management of working capital, and payment terms and conditions for purchase of the Company s
services. The Company believes its cash balances and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to fund its operations and growth
for the next twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. If the Company is unable to raise additional funding
from investors or through other avenues, it may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no assets or liabilities that require fair value measurement. 

per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately nil and , respectively, in excess of the federal
insurance limit. 

Pursuant
to ASC section 850-10-20, the related parties include (a.) affiliates of the Company Affiliate means, with respect to
any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); (b.) entities
for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value
Option of ASC section 825 10 15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c.) trusts for the benefit
of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d.) principal owners
of the Company; (e.) management of the Company; (f.) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from
fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g.) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other
to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. 

The
consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements,
expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:
(a.) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b.) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or
nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary
to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c.) the dollar amounts of transactions for each
of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that
used in the preceding period; and (d.) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if
not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

In
June 2024, the Company initiated a private place offering for its convertible promissory notes (the Debentures ). As of
September 30, 2024, the net proceeds were approximately , due to approximately paid as debt issuance cost in connection
with the issuance of the Debentures. The Debentures bears interest at per annum with a default interest rate of per annum.
The principal amount and all accrued interest are payable on December 31, 2026. The holder of the Debentures has the option to convert
the unpaid principal and interest into shares of the Company s common stock at the conversion rate of per share, subject
to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and the like and for issuances by the Company of common stock at a price per share that
is less than the then-current conversion price, subject to certain exceptions. 

In
accordance with the Debenture, the Company has the right to prepay the Debentures upon providing 45 days of its intention to prepay. 

The
outstanding principal amount of the Debentures and all accrued interest thereon shall automatically be converted into shares of common
stock at the then effective conversion price upon (i) the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) consecutive day on which the VWAP
of the Company s common stock is at least per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,
stock split, stock combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the common stock, or (ii) the execution by the Company
of a long-term lease with a data center client for all or a substantial portion of the Company s planned data center development
project. 

In
December 2023, the Company offered the holders of the Company s outstanding convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal
amount of the option to convert such notes into the Company s common stock at a price ranging from to per
share. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company converted principal and interest of approximately and ,
respectively (a total of ), for shares of the Company s common stock with a fair market value of approximately
 as of the dates of conversion. As the terms of the conversion were not in accordance with the original conversion feature,
the holders of such notes did not provide any concession to the Company, and there was not an inducement to the holders to convert. As
the offer did not have a time limit, the Company has accounted for the conversion in accordance with ASC 470-50-40-4. The difference
between the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately and the liability of was approximately ,
which was accounted for as a loss on liability settlement. The loss on the settlement was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt
on the statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the financial statements and related notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023. 

This
discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain
events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but
not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. 

Plan
of Operations 

We
are in the early stages of implementing our plan for the construction and operation of clean-energy-powered data centers to lease to
large enterprise information technology (IT) customers that are creating or addressing the growing demand for AI, Cloud and High-Performance
Computing (HPC) digital services. In planning for our initial data centers, we are in discussions with several large companies that would
lease all or part of the data center campus, with the intention of cultivating long-term strategic relationships with them once they
become our customers and providing them with solutions for their data center facilities and IT infrastructure requirements. We initially
intend to provide clean-energy-powered wholesale colocation space with flexibility for customers to scale for future growth. As currently
contemplated, our offerings will provide clean energy power, flexibility, reliability and security delivered through a tailored, customer-service-focused
platform that will be designed to foster long-term relationships. 

As
of the filing of this Report, we have completed Phase I and entered into Phase II of our data center development plans. In the initial
phase of our project, we originally signed an option agreement in March 2023 to acquire 80 acres of commercially-zoned land in Imperial
County, California. We believed this site would provide us an opportunity to acquire commercially-zoned land on which we could combine
nearby direct clean geothermal/solar energy with a 24/7 data center operation. However, in July 2024, we identified and entered into
an option agreement to acquire a larger, 315-acre parcel of land that we believe provides us with significant advantages over our prior
data center development site, which include: 

Larger,
 strategically located, industrial-zoned property with acreage for on-site switchyard, substation and additional data center buildings 

Better
 options for connectivity to high-voltage transmission lines 

Closer
 proximity to existing and planned geothermal power plants 

Shorter
 fiber routing distances to internet backbone and communications networks 

Directly
 on the main north/south transportation corridor (Hwy. 111) and gateway entrance (Sinclair Rd.) to the planned 51,000-acre Lithium
 Valley development area 

Lower
 flood risk - outside of the 100- and 500- year flood zones in a FEMA X (Unshaded) area 

In
late July 2024, we terminated our option agreement to acquire the 80-acre parcel in Imperial County, California as we believe the recently-optioned
property is better suited for our immediate needs. 

We
believe 100 clean-energy-powered data centers are an important element in the ability of the U.S. to meet its carbon neutral climate
goals and for hyperscale and enterprise IT companies to meet their shareholder and customer commitments to have an ESG-compliant, clean
digital footprint before 2030. As a result, we believe the availability of nearby clean energy for our Imperial County site will provide
us a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

In
Phase I of our development plan, which we completed in December 2023, we contracted with leading data center advisory firms to complete
site, power and connectivity assessments, feasibility studies, engineering plans and project benchmarking. Phase I of our plan included: 

Engaging
 HDR Engineering, Inc., a global professional services firm specializing in architecture, engineering , environmental and construction
 services HDR Engineering ), to complete a site assessment, project feasibility study, and the initial shovel-ready
 site development plan for our Imperial County site. 

Engaging
 ZGlobal, Inc., a power engineering and energy solutions firm ZGlobal ), to assess all available power and transmission
 routes in the immediate area of the site and to develop a plan to access power from close by geothermal and solar producers via Behind-The-Meter,
 Off-Take and Power Purchase Agreements directly and through agreements with the local grid operator. 

Engaging
 American Dark Fiber, Inc., a provider of dark fiber connectivity to municipalities, carriers, anchor institutions, content developers,
 data-center operators, and other sophisticated private network users, to develop a robust fiber-based infrastructure that will provide
 multiple diverse geographic routes of connectivity to our data center site. 

Engaging
 Linesight, a construction consultancy services firm Linesight ), to provide cost benchmarking of initial design concepts,
 and to assist with desktop pre-qualification of architect-engineering firms and construction managers. 

13 

At
the end of December 2023, we started Phase II of our data center development plan. Phase II includes hiring additional staff and consultants
to complete environmental, health and safety and cyber security procedures and to develop a set of data center operating procedures to
meet customer pre-qualification requirements. During this phase, we will also develop requests for proposals (RFPs) and contract packages
for contracting an engineering/design firm and general contractor. In addition, we will ramp up our operating staff to support the infrastructure
and buildings design processes and the development of building plans and the permit packages. We will also undertake and complete utility
studies, transmission planning, substation design and the next level of geotechnical testing. 

Over
the next few months, we plan to complete a power plan and agreements with local power producers and the local utility to deliver geothermal
and solar power to our Imperial County Data Center Campus. In addition, in November 2024, we completed the customer pre-qualifications
and basic infrastructure plans required to negotiate a letter of intent with a customer that will lease all or a substantial portion
of our planned data center capacity. We are currently in discussions with a number of companies that are interested in leasing our planned
development under a long-term, build-to-suit lease. Based upon the current interest we have received from potential customers; we expect
that we will have a letter of intent completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 

Based
on receiving a letter of intent and considering current design requirements for higher-power rack density by customers, we now contemplate
starting the design process in collaboration with a customer sometime in the first quarter of 2025 and to have plans and permit packages
completed by the end of the second quarter of 2025. If those components of Phase II are completed as planned, we would then start the
initial phase of construction by the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of 2025. 

It
is anticipated that we will incur significant expenses in the implementation of our business plan as described herein, and that we will
require substantial financing to complete the development and construction of the planned data center operation. A failure to obtain
this necessary capital when required on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development
plans, any commercialization efforts and any other operations. We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all,
to meet our future capital needs. In addition, even if we are able to obtain sufficient funding to commence our business operations,
we may need to pursue additional financing in the future to make expenditures and/or investments to support the growth of our business.
In addition, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to new competitive pressures, pay extraordinary
expenses or fund our growth, including through acquisitions. Additional funding, however, may not be available when required on terms
that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when it
is required, our ability to commence and grow our proposed business operations, to support our business and to respond to business challenges
could be significantly limited. 

We
currently have only limited capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses. To fund our business plan going forward, we intend
to raise funds from investors by issuing common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities.

Cash
flows from operations 

Cash
used in operating activities increased to approximately 492,000 in for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 40,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was predominantly related to the increase in our expenditures for filing fees, legal
fees, transfer agent fees and consulting fees paid during the period. 

Cash
flow from investing 

Our
cash used for investing activities increased to approximately 1,085,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from
approximately 854,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary use of cash was for expenditures for the
development of our Data Center Campus. 

Cash
flows from financing 

Our
cash provided by financing activities increased to approximately 1,426,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately
nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1,426,000 was due to the issuance of a promissory note in the principal
amount of 1,000,000 and the issuance of a convertible debenture in the principal amount of 460,000 less 34,000 of cash paid for expense
related to the issuance. 

Liquidity
and Material Cash Requirements 

Even
though we experienced negative cash flows from operations of approximately 492,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,
as a result of our private placement of a promissory note and convertible debentures in the principal amounts of 1,000,000 and 460,000,
respectively, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 156,000 at September 30, 2024. The promissory note we issued in February
2024 originally matured on May 30, 2024. However, the Company and note holder agreed to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2024.
We expect to be able to refinance that note prior to its maturity. However, if we are unable to do so, we believe we will be able to
negotiate an extension of the maturity date of such note as the holder of that note is a director of our company. 

It
is anticipated that we will incur expenses in the implementation of the business plan described above, and such expenses will require
substantial financing to complete the development of the property for a data center operation and to achieve our goals. We currently
have only limited capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses. To fund our business plan going forward, we intend to raise funds
from investors by issuing common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities. We are currently in discussions with several potential
funding sources. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully raise additional funds when required, if at all. 

The
failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate
our development plans, any commercialization efforts or other operations. We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms,
or at all, to meet our future capital needs. In addition, even if we are able to obtain sufficient funding to commence our business operations,
we may need to pursue additional financing in the future to make expenditures and/or investments to support the growth of our business
and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to new competitive pressures, pay extraordinary expenses
or fund our growth, including through acquisitions. Additional funds, however, may not be available when we need them on terms that are
acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it,
our ability to commence our proposed business operations, to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges
could be significantly limited.

Going
Concern 

The
unaudited financial statements included in this Report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will
continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We are presently in the
development stage and, apart from our cash balances, have only limited assets. Our company has not generated revenues in the last two
fiscal years, has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.
The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon: (i) continued financial support from our shareholders; (ii) the
ability of our company to continue raising necessary debt or equity financing to achieve its operating objectives; and (iii) our ability
to acquire assets and establish a business or merge or otherwise acquire business opportunities. 

Our
independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023
regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our financial statements contain further note disclosures
in this regard. The implementation of our business plan is dependent upon our ability to continue raising sufficient new capital from
equity or debt markets in order to fund our on-going operating losses and real estate acquisition activities. The issuance of additional
equity securities could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. 

Application
of Critical Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures of our company. Although these estimates are based on management s
knowledge of current events and actions that our company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from such estimates. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our wholly-owned subsidiary from the formation date. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Foreign
Currency Translation 

The
financial statements of our foreign subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average exchange rate during
the year for revenue, expenses, gains and losses. Translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders 
equity (deficit). Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Debt
and Debt Discounts 

In
accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options , we first allocate the cash proceeds of any notes we sell with
warrants between the notes and any warrants on a relative fair value basis. Proceeds are then allocated to the conversion feature. 

We
account for debt discounts originating in connection with conversion features that remain embedded in the related notes in accordance
with ASC 470-20. These costs are classified on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability. We amortize these costs
over the term of our debt agreements as financing cost in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
account for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value
based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over
the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which
an entity exchanges it equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities
in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of those equity instruments. 

We
use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the BSM model for measuring the fair value of options.
The stock-based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting
periods. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Our
management reviewed all recently-issued accounting standard updates ASU s not yet adopted by our company and does
not believe the future adoptions of any such ASU s may be expected to cause a material impact on our consolidated financial condition
or the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to stockholders.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our Certifying Officers ),
conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls
and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officers,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based
on their evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective. 

The
material weakness related to internal control over financial reporting that was identified at September 30, 2024 was that we did not
have sufficient personnel staffing in our accounting and financial reporting department. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate
segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate review of the financial statements. 

This
control deficiency could result in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. However, our management believes that the material weakness identified does not result in the restatement
of any previously reported financial statements or any other related financial disclosure, and management does not believe that the material
weakness had any effect on the accuracy of our financial statements included as part of this Quarterly Report. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary
and as funds allow. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

Readers
are cautioned that our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our control have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
