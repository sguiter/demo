The Company views gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities as non-credit related and through its assessment of unrealized losses has determined that these securities will recover, allowing the Company to realize the anticipated long-term economic value. The Company currently does not intend to sell, nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost. The Company employs a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair value below amortized cost for fixed maturity securities. In determining impairments, the Company evaluates several factors and circumstances, including the issuer s overall financial condition; the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings; the issuer s financial performance, including earnings trends and asset quality; any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; the general outlook for market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates; and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer s securities is below the Company s amortized cost. The Company also considers any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to make contractual payments as they come due and whether the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

Allowance for credit losses as of the end of the period 

The methodology and significant inputs used to measure the amount of credit losses were as follows: Mortgage loans the Company estimated losses by applying expected loss rates, which are based on historical data. Embedded in expected loss rates are mortgage risk ratings and risk factors associated with property type such as office, retail, lodging, multi-family and industrial. Risk ratings, based on property characteristics and metrics including the geographic market, are predominantly driven by estimates of loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. Ratings may be adjusted to reflect current conditions and to incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts, such as volatility of cash flows and valuation. Fixed maturities, Corporate bonds the Company utilized a financial model that derives expected cash flows based on probability-of-default factors by credit rating and asset duration, and loss-given-default factors based on security type. These factors are based on historical data provided by an independent third-party rating agency. In addition, other qualitative market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows may be considered, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. E.

There were transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a fixed maturity security was transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 because it was valued by a pricing service with observable inputs rather than being valued by the Company s internal matrix model. There were transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company held Level 3 liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

reporting segments: Core Commercial, Specialty, Personal Lines and Other. Core Commercial includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, and other commercial coverages provided to small and mid-sized businesses. Specialty includes four divisions of business: Professional and Executive Lines, Specialty Property and Casualty Specialty P C ), Marine, and Surety and Other. Specialty P C includes coverages such as program business, which provides commercial insurance to markets with specialized coverage or risk management needs related to groups of similar businesses, specialty industrial and commercial property, excess and surplus lines and specialty general liability coverage. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners and other personal coverages. The Other segment includes earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to the Company s former life insurance employees and agents; run-off voluntary assumed property and casualty pools and run-off direct asbestos and environmental, and product liability businesses. Also included in the Other segment during the first half of 2024 and prior were the operations of Opus Investment Management, Inc. Opus ), which provided investment management services to THG, as well as institutions, pension funds, and other organizations. During the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company exited all of Opus business operations serving unaffiliated entities. Investment management services provided by Opus to THG related to its investment-grade fixed maturities portfolio were also transferred to an external manager during the second quarter of 2024. The separate financial information is presented consistent with the way results are regularly evaluated by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company reports interest expense related to debt separately from the earnings of its reporting segments. This consists primarily of interest on the Company s senior and subordinated debentures.

As a result of continuing trends in the Company s business, reserves, including catastrophes, have been re-estimated for all prior accident years and were decreased by million and million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2024 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net favorable loss and LAE development was million, primarily as a result of net favorable development of million in Core Commercial, million in Specialty and million in Personal Lines. The favorable development in Core Commercial was primarily due to favorable catastrophe development of million, primarily due to lower than expected losses related to events from accident years 2020 through 2023, including several convective storms across multiple states, Winter Storm Elliot, Hurricane Ian, and Hurricane Ida. Additionally, and to a lesser extent, Core Commercial favorable development resulted from lower than expected non-catastrophe losses across each of the main product lines: commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation and other commercial lines. Within non-catastrophe losses, l ower than expected property losses of million were partially offset by higher than expected losses of million across several of the liability lines of business. The favorable development in Specialty was primarily due to lower than expected non-catastrophe losses in the Professional and Executive Lines division s liability claims-made coverage of million and, to a lesser extent, in the surety line. In addition, there was lower than expected catastrophe losses in our Marine and Specialty P C divisions. The net favorable development in Personal Lines was primarily due to lower than expected non-catastrophe losses of million in the personal automobile line within physical damage coverage. This favorable development was partially offset by higher than expected losses of million in other personal lines within the standalone umbrella coverage. 2023 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , net favorable loss and LAE development was million, primarily as a result of favorable development of million in Specialty, partially offset by net unfavorable development of million in Personal Lines and, to a lesser extent, net unfavorable development of million in Core Commercial. The favorable development in Specialty was primarily due to lower than expected losses and LAE of million in the Professional and Executive Lines division, primarily in accident years 2019 through 2022 and, to a lesser extent, lower than expected losses and LAE of million in the surety line. The unfavorable development in Personal Lines was primarily due to higher than expected losses of million within the personal automobile line, higher than expected losses of million in the homeowners line, primarily in accident year 2022 due to Winter Storm Elliott and, to a lesser extent, higher than expected losses in the standalone personal umbrella coverage. The higher than expected losses in the personal automobile line were primarily within bodily injury in accident years 2018, 2019 and 2022, and within property damage coverages in accident years 2021 and 2022, partially offset by lower than expected losses within personal injury protection coverages in accident years 2021 through 2022. The net unfavorable development in Core Commercial was primarily due to higher than expected losses of million within the commercial automobile line driven by higher bodily injury and personal injury protection losses in accident years 2014 through 2019 and, to a lesser extent, higher than expected losses in miscellaneous property and commercial umbrella coverages. The unfavorable development in Core Commercial was partially offset by lower than expected losses of million within the workers compensation line, primarily in accident years 2013 through 2021, and within the commercial multiple peril line, primarily in accident year 2022, due to Winter Storm Elliott.

Introdu ction 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the interim consolidated results of operations and financial condition of The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries THG ). Consolidated results of operations and financial condition are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 22, 2024. 
 Results of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company Hanover Insurance and Citizens Insurance Company of America Citizens ), our principal property and casualty companies, and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this discussion and analysis, words such as: believes, anticipates, expects, projections, outlook, should, could, plan, guidance, likely, on track to, potential, continue, targeted, designed, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. We caution readers that accuracy with respect to forward-looking projections is difficult and subject to risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties, in some cases, have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. For important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, see Risk Factors in Part II Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Executive Overview 
 Business operations consist of four reporting segments: Core Commercial, Specialty, Personal Lines and Other. 
 Our strategy, which focuses on the independent agency distribution channel, supports THG s commitment to our select independent agents. It is designed to generate profitable growth by leveraging the strengths of our distribution approach, including expansion of our agency footprint in underpenetrated geographies, as warranted. As part of that strategy, we have increased our capabilities in specialty markets and made investments designed to develop growth solutions for our agency distribution channel that meet the needs of our customers. Our goal is to grow responsibly in all of our businesses, while managing volatility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was 258.1 million, compared to a net loss of 72.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 330.7 million. This favorable change was primarily due to higher after-tax operating income. 
 Operating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP financial measure; see also Results of Operations Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Measures was 395.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss of 52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 448.2 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, improvements in current accident year underwriting results, primarily in our Personal Lines segment, and, to a lesser extent, higher net favorable development on prior years loss reserves and higher net investment income. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were 349.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 632.4 million during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 282.5 million. The catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to several convective storms across multiple states, with wind and hail damage representing the majority of reported losses, primarily in the Midwest, and, to a lesser extent, the impacts of hurricanes Helene and Beryl . The higher catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily due to several convective storms across multiple states, particularly in the Midwest, with hail and wind damage representing the majority of reported losses, primarily impacting our Personal Lines business. The lower Personal Lines current accident year losses were primarily due to the benefit of earned pricing outpacing loss trends in both personal automobile and homeowners lines, and moderated loss trends, particularly in automobile collision coverages. 
 Net favorable development on prior years loss reserves was 41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35.0 million. 
 Core Commercial 
 Core Commercial includes two businesses, small commercial and middle market, both of which focus on account business, including coverage for commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation and other (monoline general liability, ancillary professional, commercial umbrella, and monoline property). Small commercial focuses on small businesses, with annual policy premiums generally up to 50,000. Middle market provides coverage to mid-sized businesses with annual policy premiums generally between 50,000 and 500,000. Middle market offers coverage in distinct industry segments, including technology, manufacturing, human services, retail, and real estate, among others. We believe that our account-focused approach to the small commercial market and distinctiveness in the middle market, including our diversified portfolio of products, delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. We continue to pursue our core strategy of developing strong relationships with retail agents, enhancing franchise value through selective distribution, distinctive products and coverages, and through continued investment in products for additional industry segmentation.

Table of Contents 

Net premiums written increased 3.3 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by renewal price increases, partially offset by lower retention driven by underwriting actions. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net favorable development on prior years loss reserves. The competitive nature of the Core Commercial market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins, and we continue to seek rate increases across many lines of business. 
 Specialty 
 Specialty offers a comprehensive suite of products focused predominately on small to mid-sized businesses. This includes numerous specialized product areas that are organized into four distinct divisions Professional and Executive Lines, Specialty Property and Casualty Specialty P C ), Marine, and Surety and Other. We believe that this diverse set of Specialty products, distributed primarily through retail agents, supplemented by select specialists, helps to enhance our overall agent value and increase growth opportunities by providing agents easier access to placement solutions for Specialty needs, including those that complement Core Commercial accounts. 
 Net premiums written increased 5.4 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to renewal price increases. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower current accident year losses and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher expenses and lower favorable development. The competitive nature of the Specialty market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins, and we continue to seek rate increases across many lines of business. 
 Personal Lines 
 Personal Lines focuses on working with high quality, value-oriented agencies that deliver consultative selling to customers and stress the importance of account rounding, which is the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages, to address customers broader needs and objectives. Approximately 88 of our policies in force PIF have been issued to customers with multiple policies and/or coverages with us. We are focused on seeking profitable growth opportunities, building a distinctive position in the market in order to meet our customers needs, and diversifying geographically. We continue to seek appropriate rate increases that meet or exceed underlying loss cost trends, subject to regulatory and competitive considerations. 
 Net premiums written increased 3.6 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to renewal price increases, partially offset by decreased new business and lower retention. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes improved in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, improvements in current accident year underwriting results, and favorable development on prior years loss reserves. 
 Description of Segments 
 Primary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through four reporting segments: Core Commercial, Specialty, Personal Lines and Other. Core Commercial includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation, and other commercial lines coverages provided to small and mid-sized businesses. Specialty includes four divisions of business: Professional and Executive Lines, Specialty P C, Marine, and Surety and Other. Specialty P C includes coverages such as program business (providing commercial insurance to markets with specialized coverage or risk management needs related to groups of similar businesses), specialty industrial and commercial property, excess and surplus lines and specialty general liability coverage. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners and other personal coverages, such as umbrella. The Other segment includes earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to our former life insurance employees and agents; and our run-off voluntary assumed property and casualty pools, run-off direct asbestos and environmental, and product liability businesses. Also included in the Other segment during the first half of 2024 and prior were the operations of Opus Investment Management, Inc. Opus ), which provided investment management services to THG, as well as institutions, pension funds, and other organizations. During the second and third quarters of 2024, we exited all of Opus business operations serving unaffiliated entities. Investment management services provided by Opus to THG related to its investment-grade fixed maturities portfolio were also transferred to an external manager during the second quarter of 2024. 
 We report interest expense on debt separately from the earnings of our reporting segments. This consists primarily of interest on our senior and subordinated debentures.

Results of Operatio ns Consolidated 
 Consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 102.1 million, compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 93.5 million. This increase was due to after-tax operating income of 104.5 million, partially offset by an increase in after-tax net realized and unrealized investment losses of 10.6 million. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes was 150.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 136.9 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, improvements in current accident year underwriting results in our Personal Lines segment and, to a lesser extent, higher net favorable development on prior years loss reserves. 
 Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 258.1 million, compared to a net loss of 72.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 330.7 million. The favorable change year-over-year reflects higher after-tax operating income, partially offset by an increase in after-tax net realized and unrealized investment losses of 13.8 million. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes was 395.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss of 52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 448.2 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, improvements in current accident year underwriting results in our Personal Lines segment, and, to a lesser extent, higher net favorable development on prior years loss reserves and higher net investment income. 
 The following table reflects operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes for each reporting segment and a reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) from operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP measure).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to consolidated net income (loss), discussed above, we assess our financial performance based upon pre-tax operating income (loss), and we assess the operating performance of each of our four reporting segments based upon the pre-tax operating income (loss) generated by each segment. As reflected in the table above, operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes excludes interest expense on debt and certain other items, which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, gains and losses related to the repayment of debt, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes are important components in understanding and assessing our overall financial performance, we believe a discussion of operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income (loss) attributable to the core operations of the business. However, operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes, which is a non-GAAP measure, should not be construed as a substitute for income (loss) before income taxes or income (loss) from continuing operations and operating income (loss) should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss).

Catastrophe losses and prior years reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior years reserve development separately from the other components of earnings. References to current accident year underwriting results exclude prior accident year reserve development and may also be presented excluding catastrophes. Prior years reserve development and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have an effect on each year s operating income (loss) and net income (loss). Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior years reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. Discussion of catastrophe losses in this Management s Discussion and Analysis includes development on prior years catastrophe reserves and, unless otherwise indicated, such development is excluded from discussions of prior year loss and loss adjustment expenses LAE reserve development. 
 Results of Operat ions Segments 
 The following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by reporting segment. The operating results are presented before interest expense, income taxes and other items, which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses, as well as unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, and the results of discontinued operations.

 Operating income before interest expense and income taxes was 150.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an improvement of 136.9 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses in our Personal Lines and Core Commercial segments, improvements in current accident year underwriting results in our Personal Lines Segment, and favorable development on prior years loss reserves. Catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from Hurricane Helene and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Beryl and several severe wind and hail storms in the Midwest and Southeast. The higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2023 were primarily due to several convective storms across the Midwest, with hail and wind damage representing the majority of reported losses, primarily impacting our Personal Lines business. The lower Personal Lines current accident year losses were primarily due to the benefit of earned pricing outpacing loss trends in both the personal automobile and homeowners lines, and moderated loss trends, particularly in automobile collision coverages. 
 Net premiums written increased 67.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net premiums written was primarily due to renewal price increases.

outpacing loss trends in both personal automobile and homeowners lines, and moderated loss trends, particularly in automobile collision coverages. 
 We have been taking actions to improve financial results and reduce volatility within our Personal Lines segment. These actions include increasing pricing, changing certain policy terms and conditions, and being more selective on new business quoting, where permissible, around certain geographies, driver and vehicle history, and building and roof condition type. We were able to obtain pricing increases of approximately 16 in our homeowners line and approximately 15 in our personal automobile line during the third quarter of 2024 and believe that our ability to obtain pricing increases, while moderating, will continue. Consistent with our expectations, PIF declined in the third quarter of 2024, driven by lower new business, as our new business pricing is at levels at or above our renewal price increases. We expect our sequential PIF counts to continue to shrink in the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, our Personal Lines net premiums written may be affected by price competition and the regulatory environment. These factors, along with the aforementioned actions, may also affect our ability to maintain and improve underwriting results.

Pre-tax catastrophe losses were 349.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 632.4 million during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 282.5 million. The catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to several convective storms across multiple states, with wind and hail damage representing the majority of reported losses, primarily in the Midwest, and, to a lesser extent, the impacts of hurricanes Helene and Beryl . The higher catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2023 were primarily due to several convective storms across multiple states, particularly in the Midwest, with hail and wind damage representing the majority of reported losses, primarily impacting our Personal Lines business.

It is not possible to know whether the factors that affected loss reserves in the first nine months of 2024 will also occur in future periods. We encourage you to read our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our reserving process and the judgments, uncertainties and risks associated therewith. 
 Catastrophe Loss Development 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, favorable catastrophe loss development was 37.0 million, primarily due to lower than expected losses related to events from accident years 2020 through 2023, including several convective storms across multiple states, Winter Storm Elliot, Hurricane Ian, and Hurricane Ida. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total catastrophe loss development was not meaningful. 
 2024 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net favorable loss and LAE development, excluding catastrophes, was 41.8 million. Core Commercial favorable loss and LAE development was 14.9 million, with favorability in each of the main product lines: commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation and other commercial lines. Lower than expected property losses of 25.6 million were partially offset by higher than expected losses of 10.7 million across several of the liability lines. Specialty favorable loss and LAE development of 22.6 million was primarily due to lower than expected losses in our Professional and Executive Lines division s liability claims-made coverage of 14.1 million and, to a lesser extent, lower than expected losses in our surety line. Personal Lines favorable development was primarily due to lower than expected losses of 13.4 million in our personal automobile line within physical damage coverage. This favorable development was partially offset by higher than expected losses of 10.3 million in other personal lines within our standalone umbrella coverage.

2023 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net favorable loss and LAE development, excluding catastrophes, was 6.8 million. Specialty favorable loss and LAE development of 34.8 million was primarily due to lower than expected losses and LAE of 28.9 million in our Professional and Executive Lines division, notably in accident years 2019 through 2022 and, to a lesser extent, lower than expected losses and LAE in our surety line. Personal Lines unfavorable loss and LAE development of 21.1 million was primarily due to higher than expected losses in our personal automobile line of 17.1 million. The higher than expected losses in our personal automobile line were primarily within bodily injury coverages in accident years 2018, 2019 and 2022, and within property damage coverages in accident years in 2021 and 2022, partially offset by lower than expected losses within personal injury protection coverages in accident years 2021 and 2022. Core Commercial unfavorable loss and LAE development of 6.9 million was primarily due to higher than expected losses in our commercial automobile line of 14.0 million, driven by higher bodily injury and personal injury protection losses in accident years 2014 and 2019 and, to a lesser extent, higher than expected losses in general liability and commercial umbrella coverages, partially offset by lower than expected losses in our workers compensation line of 17.7 million, primarily in accident years 2013 through 2021. 
 Reinsurance Recoverables 
 Reinsurance recoverables were 1,960.9 million and 2,056.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 101.1 million and 162.0 million, respectively, represent billable recoverables. A reinsurance recoverable is billable after an eligible reinsured claim is paid by an insurer. Billable reinsurance recoverables related to the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (the MCCA were 48.1 million and 72.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and billable non-MCCA reinsurance recoverables totaled 53.0 million and 89.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there were 0.6 million of billed balances outstanding greater than 90 days. At December 31, 2023, there were no billed balances outstanding greater than 90 days.

The increase in net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates and the continued investment of operational cashflows, partially offset by lower partnership income. Income from partnerships can vary significantly from period to period based on the performance in the underlying portfolios. Also, partnership income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from a real estate property sale in a tax credit partnership.

Cash and Investments 
 Total cash and investments increased 728.6 million, or 7.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to continued investment of cashflows from operations and net market value appreciation, partially offset by the funding of financing activities, including our dividend payments.

Based on ratings by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC ), approximately 95 of the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of investment-grade securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The quality of our fixed maturity portfolio remains strong based on ratings, capital structure position, support through guarantees, underlying security, issuer diversification and yield curve position. Our U.S. Treasury and government agencies fixed maturities are directly or indirectly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Our municipal bonds include revenue bonds and general obligations of state and local issuers. Corporate fixed maturities include publicly traded and privately placed securities in the industrial, financial, and utility sectors. Residential mortgage-backed securities are structured securities that are collateralized by residential real estate loans and are primarily U.S. agency-backed. Our commercial mortgage-backed securities are structured securities that are collateralized by commercial real estate loans and are well-diversified by geography, property type, expected maturity and vintage year. Our other asset-backed securities are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by consumer and corporate borrowings. 
 Our investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed maturity securities whose fair value is susceptible to market risk, including interest rate changes. See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Duration is a measurement used to quantify our inherent interest rate risk and analyze invested assets relative to our reserve liabilities.

Our fixed maturity and equity securities are carried at fair value. Financial instruments, whose value was determined using significant management judgment or estimation, constituted less than 1 of the total assets we measured at fair value. See also Note 4 Fair Value in the Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Limited partnerships and other investments consist primarily of our interest in corporate middle market and real estate limited partnerships. Corporate middle market limited partnerships may invest in senior or subordinated debt, preferred or common equity or a combination thereof, of privately-held middle market businesses. Real estate limited partnerships hold equity ownership positions in real properties and invest in debt secured by real properties. Our limited partnerships are generally accounted for under the equity method, or as a practical expedient using the fund s net asset value, with financial information provided by the partnership on a two- or three-month lag. 
 Mortgage and other loans consist of commercial mortgage loan participations, which represent our interest in commercial mortgage loans originated by a third-party. We share, on a pro-rata basis, in all related cash flows of the underlying mortgage loans, which are primarily investment-grade quality and diversified by geographic area and property type. 
 Equity securities primarily consist of U.S. income-oriented large capitalization common stocks and a broadly diversified U.S. equity index exchange-traded fund. 
 Although we expect to invest new funds primarily in investment-grade fixed maturities, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, a portion of funds in below investment-grade fixed maturities, limited partnerships, common equity securities and other investment assets. 
 Impairments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net impairment losses of 0.6 million, consisting of 0.4 million on mortgage loans and 0.2 million on fixed maturities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net impairment losses of 5.5 million, consisting of 4.0 million on mortgage loans and 1.5 million on fixed maturities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, impairments were not material. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net impairments of 16.5 million, consisting primarily of losses on intent to sell fixed maturities in the banking sector of 10.3 million, and 5.4 million of estimated credit losses on mortgage loans. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was 7.5 million and 10.0 million, respectively, and the allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities was 0.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively. 
 The carrying value of fixed maturity securities on non-accrual status was 14.4 million at September 30, 2024, and 14.8 million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, a mortgage loan with a carrying value of 5.3 million was also on non-accrual status. The effects on income of non-accruals for fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities and mortgage loans, were not material. Any defaults in the fixed maturities or mortgage loan portfolios in future periods may negatively affect investment income. 
 Unrealized Losses 
 Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities at September 30, 2024 were 396.6 million, an improvement of 228.1 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to lower interest rates. At September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of 118.9 million on corporate fixed maturities, 105.1 million on residential mortgage-backed securities, 90.0 million on municipals and 44.0 million on U.S. government securities. See Note 3 Investments in the Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

We view gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities as non-credit related since it is our assessment that these securities will recover, allowing us to realize their anticipated long-term economic value. Further, we do not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell, such debt securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost (See also Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Inherent in our assessment are the risks that market factors may differ from our expectations; we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs or an economic purpose; or changes in the credit assessment from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments. To the extent that there are such adverse changes, an impairment would be recognized as a realized loss. Although unrealized losses on fixed maturities are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized, the fair value of the underlying investment, which does reflect the unrealized loss, is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers.

Our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be significantly impacted by changes in market values of our securities. Market volatility could increase and defaults on fixed income securities could occur. As a result, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. 
 The U.S. economy continued to expand at a solid pace during the third quarter of 2024. Inflation moved closer to the Federal Reserve s (the Fed current two percent long-term target. However, job gains slowed and the unemployment rate, while still low, crept up in the third quarter. In September, the Fed announced its first rate cut in what is expected to be a cutting cycle, reducing the federal funds target range to 4.75 to 5.00 . Despite the easing, financial conditions continue to be tight and remain a challenge to the U.S. economy. This may increase the likelihood of defaults on our fixed income investments, particularly with respect to non-investment grade debt securities. Geopolitical risks also create economic uncertainty, the extent of which is unknown. Although we perform rigorous credit analysis of our fixed income investments, it is difficult to foresee which issuers, industries or markets, if any, will be most affected. As a result, the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate, and we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods.

We manage investment assets for our Core Commercial, Specialty, Personal Lines and Other segments based on the requirements of our combined property and casualty insurance companies. We allocate the investment income, expenses, and net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses to our Core Commercial, Specialty, Personal Lines and Other segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying businesses. 
 Net realized and unrealized investment losses were 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net realized and unrealized investment losses were primarily due to 23.5 million of net realized losses from sales of investments, primarily fixed maturities. These realized losses were partially offset by changes in the fair value of equity securities of 11.7 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net realized and unrealized investment losses were primarily due to the change in fair value of equity securities of 5.2 million and, to a lesser extent, from net realized losses from sales of investments, primarily fixed maturities. 
 Net realized and unrealized investment losses were 41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized and unrealized investment losses were primarily due to 55.2 million of net realized losses from sales of investments, primarily fixed maturities, and, to a lesser extent, from impairment losses on investments, including 3.3 million of credit-related impairments and 2.2 million of losses related to intent to sell securities. These investment losses were partially offset by changes in the fair value of equity securities of 19.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net realized and unrealized investment losses were primarily due to impairment losses on investments, including 10.3 million of losses related to intent to sell securities and 6.2 million of credit-related impairments and, to a lesser extent, from changes in the fair value of equity securities of 13.4 million. 
 Income Taxes 
 We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes our holding company and its domestic subsidiaries (including non-insurance operations). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for income taxes from continuing operations was an expense of 27.6 million compared to a benefit of 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The expense in 2024 resulted in a consolidated effective tax rate of 21.3 on pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The benefit from 2023 resulted in a consolidated effective tax rate that was not meaningful for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for 2024 includes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of 0.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively. Absent these items, the provision for income taxes would have been an expense of 28.6 million, or 22.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The tax benefit of 9.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was the result of applying a higher year-to-date tax rate, due to lower year-to-date underwriting income, to a 0.9 million pre-tax loss. 
 The income tax provision on operating results was an expense of 30.8 million compared to a benefit of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These provisions resulted in effective tax rates on operating income of 21.7 and 30.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 provision reflects the aforementioned excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of 0.4 million. Absent this item, the provision for income taxes would have been an expense of 31.2 million, or 22.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for income taxes from continuing operations was an expense of 68.3 million compared to a benefit of 35.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These provisions resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of 20.9 and 32.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These provisions include excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of 1.6 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, these provisions reflect benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of 1.2 million in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Absent these items, the provision for income taxes would have been an expense of 71.1 million, or 21.8 , and a benefit of 33.1 million, or 30.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower effective federal tax rate in 2024 was due to higher underwriting income in the current period. 
 The income tax provision on operating results was an expense of 78.8 million compared to a benefit of 21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These provisions resulted in an effective tax rate on operating income of 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an effective tax rate on operating losses of 27.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These provisions include excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of 1.6 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Absent this item, the provisions for income taxes would have been an expense of 80.4 million, or 21.7 , and a benefit of 20.2 million, or 25.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Critical Accoun ting Estimates 
 Interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and include certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. While we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, the use of different assumptions could produce materially different accounting estimates. As disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to our operations and require the most subjective and complex judgment: 
 Reserve for losses and loss expenses 

Reinsurance recoverable balances 

Pension benefit obligations 

Investment credit losses 

For a more detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates, see our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Total Statutory Capital and Surplus

The statutory capital and surplus for our insurance subsidiaries increased 250.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. This increase was primarily due to underwriting profits, partially offset by net realized and unrealized investment losses. 
 The NAIC prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk-based capital RBC ). RBC ratios for regulatory purposes are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the Authorized Control Level (the Regulatory Scale however, in the insurance industry, RBC ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the Company Action Level. The following table reflects the Company Action Level, the Authorized Control Level and RBC ratios for Hanover Insurance (which includes Citizens and other insurance subsidiaries), as of September 30, 2024, expressed both on the Industry Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by the Company Action Level) and Regulatory Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by Authorized Control Level):

Liquidity and Cap ital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations. As a holding company, our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries. However, dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by regulators, such as prior notice periods and the requirement that dividends in excess of a specified percentage of statutory surplus or prior years statutory earnings receive prior approval (so called extraordinary dividends ). During the first nine months of 2024, Hanover Insurance did not provide dividends to the holding company. 
 Sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums collected, investment income and maturing investments. Primary cash outflows are payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy and contract acquisition expenses, other underwriting expenses, and investment purchases. Cash outflows related to losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses, either individually or in the aggregate. We periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short-term and long-term cash requirements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 592.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 269.0 million during the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 323.9 million. The increase in cash provided was primarily due to an increase in premiums received and lower loss and LAE payments made during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by higher income tax payments made in 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 390.8 million during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 186.4 million during the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, cash used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of fixed maturities. During the first nine months of 2023, cash used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of fixed maturities, partially offset by net sales of equity securities. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 90.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 93.1 million during the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from three quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders.

Table of Contents 

Dividends to common shareholders are subject to quarterly board approval and declaration. During the first nine months of 2024, as declared by the Board, we paid three quarterly dividends, each for 0.85 per share, to our shareholders totaling 91.7 million. We believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends should the Board of Directors declare them. 
 At September 30, 2024, THG, as a holding company, held approximately 243.2 million of fixed maturities and cash. We believe our holding company assets will be sufficient to meet our short-term obligations, which we expect to consist primarily of quarterly dividends to our shareholders (as and to the extent declared), interest on our senior and subordinated debentures, certain costs associated with benefits due to our former life employees and agents and, to the extent required, payments related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries. As discussed below, we have, and opportunistically may continue to, repurchase our common stock and debt. We do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend additional funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund short-term holding company obligations; however, we may decide to do so. 
 We expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations, including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan. We believe that this plan is fully funded. The ultimate payment amounts for our benefit plan is based on several assumptions, including but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates, inflation and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations. Since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are almost certain, changes, both positive and negative, to our current funding status and ultimately our obligations in future periods are likely. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short-term investments. Uncertainty in the financial markets continued to affect the value of investments currently held by THG and its subsidiaries, many of which remain in unrealized loss positions. We believe that the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize the long-term economic value of our portfolio, including the securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries cash requirements since we expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations. However, unforeseen business needs or other items may occur which could cause us to sell those securities in a loss position before their values fully recover, thereby resulting in the recognition of impairment charges in that time period. 
 The Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for aggregate repurchases of our common stock of up to 1.3 billion. Under the repurchase authorization, we may repurchase, from time to time, common stock in amounts, at prices and at such times as we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs, or other transactions. We are not required to purchase any specific number of shares or to make purchases by any certain date under this program. During the first nine months of 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under this program. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 7.9 million shares under this 1.3 billion program and had approximately 330 million available for additional repurchases. 
 We maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB to provide access to additional liquidity based on our holdings of FHLB stock and pledged collateral. At September 30, 2024, we had borrowing capacity of 133.6 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under this short-term facility at September 30, 2024; however, we have borrowed and may continue to borrow, from time to time, through this facility to provide short-term liquidity. 
 On July 21, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed 150.0 million at any one time outstanding, with the option to increase the facility up to 300.0 million (assuming no default and satisfaction of other specified conditions, including the receipt of additional lender commitments). The agreement also includes an uncommitted subfacility of 50.0 million for standby letters of credit. Borrowings, if any, under this agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, either (i) the greatest of, (a) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent, (b) the NYFRB Rate plus half a percent, or (c) the one month Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus one percent; each subject to a margin that ranges from 0.125 to 0.625 depending on our debt rating, or (ii) Adjusted SOFR Rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin that ranges from 1.125 to 1.625 depending on our debt rating. The agreement also contains certain financial covenants such as maintenance of specified levels of consolidated equity and leverage ratios. At September 30, 2024 and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under this credit agreement. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt and credit agreements.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on our controls evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that there were no such changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The Company has been named a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company is involved, from time to time, in examinations, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. The potential outcome of any such action or regulatory proceedings in which the Company has been named a defendant or the subject of an inquiry, examination or investigation, and its ultimate liability, if any, from such actions or regulatory proceedings, is difficult to predict at this time. The ultimate resolutions of such proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, although they could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period.

ITEM 1A RI SK FACTORS 
 This document contains, and management may make, certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. When used in our Management s Discussion and Analysis, words such as: believes, anticipates, expects, projections, outlook, should, could, plan, guidance, likely, on track to, potential, continue, targeted, designed, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. We caution readers that accuracy with respect to forward-looking projections is difficult and subject to risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties, in some cases, have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results for the remainder of 2024 and beyond to differ materially from historical results and from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. We operate in a business environment that is continually changing, and as such, new risk factors may emerge over time. Additionally, our business is conducted in competitive markets and, therefore, involves a higher degree of risk. We cannot predict these new risk factors, nor can we assess the impact, if any, that they may have on our business in the future. 
 Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 changes in the demand for our products; 

risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to retain profitable policies in force and attract profitable policies, and to increase rates commensurate with, or in excess of, loss trends; 

adverse claims experience or changes in our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, including with respect to catastrophes, which may result in lower current year underwriting results or adverse loss development, and could impact our carried reserves; 

uncertainties with respect to the long-term profitability of our products, including with respect to newer products, or longer-tail products covering casualty losses; 

disruption in our distribution channels, including the loss or disruption of our independent agency channel, and the impact of competition and consolidation in the industry and among agents and brokers; 

changes in frequency and loss severity trends, exacerbated by fluctuations in economic conditions; 

changes in regulation, legislation, economic, market and political conditions, particularly with respect to rates, policy terms and conditions, payment flexibility, and regions where we have geographical concentrations; 

volatile and unpredictable developments, including severe weather and other natural physical events, catastrophes, pandemics, civil unrest, and terrorist actions, and the uncertainty in estimating the resulting losses; 

impacts of changing climate conditions and weather patterns, causing higher levels of losses from weather events to persist and leading to new or enhanced regulations; 

limitations on the physical ability to adjust claims or the availability of sufficient information to accurately estimate a loss at a point in time and the limitations and assumptions used to model property and casualty losses in general; 

risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to collect all amounts due from reinsurers and to maintain current levels of reinsurance in the future at commercially reasonable rates, or at all; 

heightened volatility, fluctuations in interest rates (which have a significant impact on the market value of our investment portfolio and thus our book value), inflationary pressures, default rates, difficult economic, market and political conditions, and other factors that affect investment returns from our investment portfolio; 

recessionary economic periods that may inhibit our ability to increase pricing or renew business, and which may be accompanied by higher claims activity in certain lines; 

risks and uncertainties associated with our participation in shared market mechanisms, mandatory reinsurance programs and mandatory and voluntary pooling arrangements, including the MCCA; 

an increase in mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds; 

actions by our competitors, many of which are larger or have greater financial resources than we do; 

loss, prolonged illness or retirement of key employees; 

operating difficulties and other unintended consequences from the introduction of new products and related technology changes and applications, including the use of pricing models and artificial intelligence, as well as new operating models, particularly as business processes become more digital; 

43 

Table of Contents 

changes in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings; 

negative changes in our level of statutory surplus; 

risks and uncertainties with respect to our growth or operating strategies, or with respect to our expense and strategic initiatives; 

our ability to declare and pay dividends; 

changes in accounting principles and related financial reporting requirements; 

errors or omissions in connection with the administration of any of our products; 

risks and uncertainties with our operations and technology, including our internal and external information systems, such as cloud-based data information storage or network systems, information security, cyber risks, artificial intelligence, remote working capabilities, and/or outsourcing relationships and third-party operations and data security that may negatively impact our ability to conduct business; 

an inability to be compliant with recently implemented regulations or existing regulations, such as those relating to Sarbanes-Oxley, or a failure of internal controls; 

risks, uncertainties or unfavorable developments associated with enacted legislation, litigation matters, social inflation and the possibility of adverse judicial decisions, including those which expand policy coverage beyond its intended scope or award bad faith, or other non-contractual damages, and including those related to the Michigan legislation which was effective July 2, 2020 and reformed the prior requirements that all personal and commercial automobile polices issued in the state include no-fault personal injury protection coverage without a cap on maximum benefits allowed and the resulting increase in litigation challenging or associated with this reform; 

risks and uncertainties associated with pandemics and related economic and socio-economic conditions; and 

other factors described in such forward-looking statements. 

In addition, historical and future reported financial results include estimates with respect to premiums written and earned, reinsurance recoverables, current accident year picks, loss and loss adjustment reserves and development, fair values of certain investments, other assets and liabilities, tax, contingent and other liabilities, and other items. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available. 
 Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake any responsibility to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 
 For a more detailed discussion of our risks and uncertainties, see also Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
