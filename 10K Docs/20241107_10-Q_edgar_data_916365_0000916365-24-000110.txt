 Covenants and Default Provisions of the Debt Agreements 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the 2022 Senior Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Facility (collectively, the Debt Agreements required quarterly compliance with respect to material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.

The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, and rent expense consolidated EBITDAR to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments). The fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be greater than or equal to to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The leverage ratio compares total funded debt to consolidated EBITDAR. The leverage ratio was required to be less than or equal to to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The Debt Agreements also contain certain other restrictions regarding additional subsidiary indebtedness, business operations, subsidiary guarantees, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.

 The Debt Agreements contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, certain ERISA events, and invalidity of loan documents. Upon certain changes of control, amounts outstanding under the Debt Agreements could become due and payable. In addition, under the Note Purchase Facility, upon an event of default or change of control, a whole payment may become due and payable. 
 
 The Note Purchase Facility also requires that, in the event the Company amends its 2022 Senior Credit Facility, or any subsequent credit facility of or greater, such that it contains covenant or default provisions that are not provided in the Note Purchase Facility or that are similar to those contained in the Note Purchase Facility but which contain percentages, amounts, formulas, or grace periods that are more restrictive than those set forth in the Note Purchase Facility or are otherwise more beneficial to the lenders thereunder, the Note Purchase Facility shall be automatically amended to include such additional or amended covenants and/or default provisions.

However, litigation and other legal matters involve an element of uncertainty. Future developments in such matters, including adverse decisions or settlements or resulting required changes to the Company's business operations, could affect our consolidated operating results when resolved in future periods or could result in liability or other amounts material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, which address activities, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including sales and earnings growth, new store growth, estimated results of operations in future periods (including, but not limited to, sales, comparable store sales, operating margins, net income, and earnings per diluted share), the declaration and payment of dividends, the timing and amount of share repurchases, future capital expenditures (including their timing, amount and nature), sale-leasebacks, acquisitions, business strategy, strategic initiatives, expansion and growth of our business operations, and other such matters are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with such words as will, plan, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, optimistic, forecasted and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements may be affected by certain risks and uncertainties, any one, or a combination of which, could materially affect the results of our operations. To take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the PSLRA, we have identified certain factors, in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These Risk Factors may be updated from time to time in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or other subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 
 Forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are based on our knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors listed above or other factors, actual results could differ materially from those reflected by any forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made are qualified by these cautionary statements and those contained in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). There can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on the Company or our business and operations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. 
 
 Seasonality and Weather 
 
 Our business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. We usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold weather selling season. We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
 
 Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain, and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions. Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute this strategy. For more information regarding the risks we face in this regard, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Weather and Climate Risks in our 2023 Form 10-K .

 Performance Metrics 
 
 Comparable Store Metrics 
 
 Comparable store metrics are a key performance indicator used in the retail industry and by the Company to measure the performance of the underlying business. Our comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales. Stores closed during either of the years being compared are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. Stores relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics calculations became material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations. An Orscheln store is considered a comparable store one year after its point-of-sale system conversion. Fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 each include 52 weeks. Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Transaction Count and Transaction Value 
 
 Transaction count and transaction value metrics are used by the Company to measure sales performance. Transaction count represents the number of customer transactions during a given period. Transaction value represents the average amount paid per transaction and is calculated as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions during a given period. 

Results of Operations 
 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.

 Fiscal Three Months (Third Quarter) Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 1.6 to 3.47 billion from 3.41 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales was driven by new store openings. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 0.2 , driven by a comparable average transaction count increase of 0.3 , offset by a comparable average ticket decrease of 0.5 . Comparable store sales results reflect continued strength in big ticket categories, partially offset by declines in year-round discretionary categories. As expected, consumable, usable and edible products were modestly negative with positive unit growth offset by average unit price pressure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales increased 4.3 and comparable store sales decreased 0.4 . 
 
 Sales from new stores were 70.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which represented 2.0 percentage points of the 1.6 net sales increase over third quarter fiscal 2023 net sales. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, sales from stores open less

 Gross profit increased 3.2 to 1.29 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 1.25 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percent of net sales, gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 56 basis points to 37.2 from 36.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy. These improvements in gross margin rate were partially offset by growth in big ticket categories, which have below chain-average margins. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 6.2 to 965.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 909.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percent of net sales, SG A expenses increased 119 basis points to 27.8 from 26.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in SG A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center, lapping a one-time depreciation expense benefit in the prior year of 11.3 million or approximately 35 basis points, as well as modest deleverage of the Company s fixed costs given the slight decline in comparable store sales. These factors were partially offset by a disciplined focus on productivity, cost control and modest benefits from the Company s sale-leaseback strategy. 
 
 Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 4.8 to 324.6 million from 340.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The effective income tax rate was 22.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by a decrease in state income taxes and an increase in federal tax credits. 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 5.3 to 241.5 million, or 2.24 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 255.0 million, or 2.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of 149.8 million, excluding the 1 excise tax, as part of our share repurchase program and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling 117.8 million, returning 267.6 million to our stockholders. 
 
 Fiscal Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 2.0 to 11.11 billion from 10.90 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales was driven by growth in new store sales which increased 2.0 . Comparable store sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were flat. The comparable store sales results for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included an increase in comparable average transaction count of 0.3 , partially offset by a decrease in comparable average transaction value of 0.2 . In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6.8 and comparable store sales increased 1.5 . 
 
 Sales from new stores were 219.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which represented 2.0 percentage points of the 2.0 net sales increase over the first nine months of fiscal 2023 net sales. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, sales from stores open less than one year were 498.2 million, which represented 4.9 percentage points of the 6.8 increase over the first nine months of fiscal 2022 net sales.

 Gross profit increased 3.3 to 4.07 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 3.94 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a percent of net sales, gross margin in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 49 basis points to 36.6 from 36.1 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs and disciplined product cost management. Additionally, gross margin continued to benefit from the Company s ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 4.6 to 2.92 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 2.79 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a percent of net sales, SG A expenses increased 65 basis points to 26.3 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 25.6 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in SG A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to the Company s planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization. A modest deleverage of fixed costs given the level of comparable sales growth and start-up costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center also contributed to the increase in SG A as a percent of net sales. These factors were partially offset by a disciplined focus on productivity, cost control and modest benefits from the Company s sale-leaseback strategy. 
 
 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 0.4 to 1.15 billion compared to 1.14 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 22.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 22.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by a decrease in state income taxes.

Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 0.6 to 864.8 million, or 8.00 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 859.3 million, or 7.81 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of the Company s common stock at a total cost of 406.4 million, excluding the 1 excise tax, as part of our share repurchase program and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling 355.2 million, returning 761.6 million to our stockholders. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, existing store remodeling and improvements, store relocations, distribution facility capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities, share repurchases, cash dividends, and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise. 
 
 Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, remaining funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively. 
 
 We plan to continue to leverage our sale-leaseback program on both existing owned stores and future new store openings in order to help fund our planned owned store development over the next several years. 
 
 We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, normal trade credit, and access to the long-term debt capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, existing store remodeling and improvements, store relocations, distribution facility capacity and improvements, and information technology improvements, for the next 12 months and the longer term foreseeable future.

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Operating activities provided net cash of 903.6 million and 937.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The 34.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 
 
 Fiscal Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Variance Net income 864.8 859.3 5.5 Depreciation and amortization 327.1 289.8 37.3 Gain on disposal of property and equipment (38.8) (27.5) (11.3) Share-based compensation expense 35.1 45.2 (10.1) Deferred income taxes (21.2) 8.1 (29.3) Inventories and accounts payable (266.7) (134.0) (132.7) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9.1 (28.6) 37.7 Accrued expenses (38.6) (126.8) 88.2 Income taxes (11.9) 24.2 (36.1) Other, net 44.7 28.2 16.5 Net cash provided by operating activities 903.6 937.9 (34.3) 
 Note: Amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding. 
 
 The 34.3 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in inventories and accounts payable due to overall Company growth, investments in both consumable, usable and edible products and big ticket inventory categories, and timing of accounts payable. This decrease was partially offset by changes in accrued expenses from timing of payments. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Investing activities used net cash of 460.1 million and 454.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The 5.5 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is due to changes in the following investing activities (in millions): 
 
 Fiscal Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Variance Existing stores (209.8) (246.2) 36.4 New stores, relocated stores and stores not yet opened (178.8) (72.3) (106.5) Information technology (95.8) (86.4) (9.4) Distribution center capacity and improvements (45.2) (120.4) 75.2 Corporate and other (8.4) (1.4) (7.0) Total capital expenditures (538.0) (526.7) (11.3) Proceeds from sale of property and equipment 77.9 57.8 20.1 Proceeds from Orscheln acquisition net working capital settlement 4.3 (4.3) Proceeds from sale of Orscheln corporate headquarters and distribution center 10.0 (10.0) Net cash used in investing activities (460.1) (454.6) (5.5) 
 Note: Amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding. 
 
 The decrease in spending for existing stores in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily reflects the ongoing completion of Orscheln store remodels throughout fiscal 2023. Adjusting for the 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 completion of Orscheln store remodels, existing store capital spend reflects a continued commitment to strategic initiatives related to existing store remodels. This includes internal space productivity and side lot garden center transformations. 
 
 The increase in spending for new stores, relocated stores and stores not yet opened in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to increased capital outlay associated with our owned store development program. This program began in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 The increase in spending for information technology in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is attributable to continued support for improvements in mobility in our stores, our digital initiatives, increased security and compliance, and other strategic initiatives. 
 
 The decrease in spending for distribution center capacity and improvements in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily reflects a reduction in distribution center construction projects. The first nine months of fiscal 2023 reflect construction costs associated with both the Navarre, Ohio distribution center, which opened during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and the Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center, which opened during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The first nine months of fiscal 2024 solely reflect construction costs associated with the Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center. 
 
 The increase in spending for corporate in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to an increase in spending on information technology projects at the Store Support Center related to supporting store efficiency initiatives. 
 
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the Company opened 54 new Tractor Supply stores compared to 51 new Tractor Supply stores during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are currently estimated to be in the range of 625.0 million to 700.0 million, net of proceeds from the sale of existing Company-owned stores as part of our sale-leaseback strategy. The capital expenditures include plans to open a total of approximately 80 new Tractor Supply stores, continue Project Fusion remodels and garden center transformations, and open a total of 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Financing activities used net cash of 654.3 million and 264.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The 390.2 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is due to changes in the following (in millions): 
 
 Fiscal Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Variance Net borrowings and repayments under debt facilities 100.0 572.0 (472.0) Repurchase of common stock (406.7) (480.4) 73.7 Cash dividends paid to stockholders (355.2) (338.2) (17.0) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock 32.5 19.9 12.6 Other, net (24.9) (37.4) 12.5 Net cash used in financing activities (654.3) (264.1) (390.2) 
 Note: Amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding. 
 
 The 390.2 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 is primarily due to the reduced borrowing activity in the current period, partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of common stock as compared to prior period.

 Dividends 
 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends: 
 Date Declared Dividend Amount Per Share of Common Stock Record Date Date Paid August 7, 2024 1.10 August 26, 2024 September 10, 2024 May 8, 2024 1.10 May 28, 2024 June 11, 2024 February 5, 2024 1.10 February 26, 2024 March 12, 2024 August 9, 2023 1.03 August 28, 2023 September 12, 2023 May 10, 2023 1.03 May 30, 2023 June 13, 2023 February 8, 2023 1.03 February 27, 2023 March 14, 2023 
 
 It is the present intention of the Company s Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Company s Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, along with any other factors that the Company s Board of Directors deem relevant. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 1.10 per share of the Company s outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2024. 

Share Repurchase Program 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in February 2007. The total authorized amount of the program, which has been increased from time to time, is currently 6.50 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited, temporarily paused, or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of 641.7 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. 
 
 The following table provides the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and total cost of share repurchases pursuant to our publicly announced repurchase plan during the fiscal three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
 Fiscal Three Months Ended Fiscal Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total number of shares repurchased 561 632 1,568 2,190 Average price paid per share 267.12 214.45 259.22 222.20 Total cost of share repurchases (a) 
 151,342 136,778 410,431 491,394 
 (a) Effective January 1, 2023, the Company s share repurchases are subject to a 1 excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases represent direct costs of the repurchase and are recorded as a part of the cost basis of the shares within treasury stock. The cost of shares repurchased may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at the end of a period and excise taxes incurred on share repurchases.

The Company s financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K .

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 For a description of the Company's legal proceedings, refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC, in connection with evaluating the Company, our business, and the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K . Other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. 
 
 The risk factor under the heading Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands in our 2023 Form 10-K is replaced in its entirety by the below: 
 
 Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands. 
 
 Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name, including our exclusive brands. The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based on fact. Any failure to comply or accusation of our failure to comply with data privacy, environmental, ethical, labor, product, social, and other regulatory and industry standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism on social media regarding our company and management, as well as our stewardship strategies and changes in those strategies, which may be considered to be overreaching by some stakeholders and inadequate by other stakeholders. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times has impacted our relationships with our customers and investors, and may do so in the future. Further, adverse publicity about our merchandise products or company, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying the products we offer. Additionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 
 The risk factor under the heading We may be unable to meet our ESG goals, particularly with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions, or otherwise meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to ESG and/or DE I matters is replaced in its entirety by the below: 
 
 Our investors, other stakeholders, and regulators may not be satisfied with our ESG efforts including DE I. 
 
 In July 2024, we announced a change in our goals relating to our carbon emissions goals and DE I efforts. Our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our efforts or the changes in our goals, which could adversely affect public perception of our business, team member morale, customer or stockholder support as well as business and/or financial performance. For example, certain of our investors, as well as shareholder advocates, are placing an increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG including DE I issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. Additionally, certain stock indices consider ESG factors in determining which companies qualify for inclusion. If our investors, shareholder advocates, or indices in which we are included react negatively to the changes in our goals, it could have a negative impact on our stock price. Future changes to our ESG goals and strategies may further adversely impact our relationship with our team members, customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders, which could result in a reduction in sales, a negative impact on our stock price, and erosion of stockholder trust. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, including potential enforcement action, if any of our regulators has a negative reaction to the changes in our goals or perceives our goals to conflict with regulatory requirements.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Share repurchases were made pursuant to the share repurchase program, which is described under Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the heading Share Repurchase Program. Additionally, the Company withholds shares from vested restricted stock units and performance-based restricted share units to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Stock repurchase activity during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was as follows: 
 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Dollar 
 Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (b) 
 June 30, 2024 - July 27, 2024 (a) 
 193,647 265.07 193,647 740,156,863 July 28, 2024 - August 24, 2024 (a) 
 174,350 260.04 171,022 695,663,309 August 25, 2024 - September 28, 2024 (a) 
 196,217 275.24 196,135 641,682,459 Total 564,214 267.05 560,804 641,682,459 
 (a) The number of shares purchased and average price paid per share includes 0, 3,328, and 82 shares withheld from vested stock awards to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding requirements for the period of June 30, 2024 - July 27, 2024, July 28, 2024 - August 24, 2024, and August 25, 2024 - September 28, 2024, respectively. 
 
 (b) Excludes excise taxes incurred on share repurchases. 
 
 We expect to implement the balance of the share repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. 
 
 Any additional share repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and will depend upon earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, along with any other factors which the Company s Board of Directors deems relevant. The program may be limited, temporarily paused, or terminated at any time, without prior notice. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 5.

 During the Company s three fiscal months ended September 28, 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice of the meeting shall be given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer (if any), the President, the Secretary or the other persons calling the meeting, and shall state the place, date and hour, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be directed to each stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given at the time specified in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
 
 (b) Waiver of Notice . Whenever notice is required to be given to the stockholders under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws, a written waiver signed by a stockholder entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by a stockholder entitled to notice, whether before, at or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required with respect to a particular matter, the presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of such class or classes then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum 
 18 

with respect to a vote on such matter. A quorum, once established at a meeting, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. 
 
 Section 1.6 Adjournments . In the absence of a quorum, a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy at a meeting, or, if no stockholder entitled to vote is present in person or by proxy, any officer entitled to act as chairman or secretary of such meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time or place. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are provided in a manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provided, however, that, if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. In no event will the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described in paragraphs (b) or (c) of Section 1.1 of these By- Laws. 
 
 Section 1.7 Organization . The Chairman of the Board, or if there is no Chairman of the Board or in his absence or disability, the Chief Executive Officer, or if there is no Chief Executive Officer or in his absence or disability, the President, or in the absence or disability of all of them, a presiding person appointed by the Board of Directors, shall act as the presiding person of all meetings of stockholders. The Secretary or, in his absence or disability, any Assistant Secretary, or, in the absence of all of them, a secretary appointed by the presiding person of the meeting, shall act as secretary at all meetings of stockholders. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate including, without limitation, such guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the presiding person at any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules shall apply 
 
 (a) The presiding person may ask or require that anyone not a bona fide stockholder or duly authorized proxy leave the meeting. 
 
 (b) The presiding person may propose any motion for vote. The order of business at all meetings of stockholders shall be determined by the presiding person. 
 
 (c) The presiding person may impose any reasonable limits with respect to participation in the meeting by stockholders, including, without limitation, limits on the amount of time that may be taken up at the meeting by the remarks or questions of any stockholder, limits on the number of questions a stockholder may ask and limits as to the subject matter and timing of questions and remarks by stockholders.

Section 1.8 Voting . Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder which is registered in his name on the record date for the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, for all matters the affirmative vote (which need not be by ballot) of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter of such vote shall be the act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter of such vote shall be the act of such class or classes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vote required for the election of directors shall be as provided in Section 3.2 of Article III. 
 
 Section 1.9 Proxies . Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate actions in writing may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors. 
 
 Section 1.10 Stockholder List . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address and number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. 
 
 Section 1.11 Inspectors of Election . In advance of any stockholders meeting, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. 
 
 Section 1.12 Fixing the Record Date . So that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and shall not be more than 60 nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, 
 20 

notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed by the Board of Directors. 
 
 So that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and (a) in the case of a written consent, shall not exceed by more than ten (10) days the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, or (b) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed by the Board of Directors.

(d) In determining whether the Minimum Holding has been achieved, multiple Special Meeting Requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together if each Special Meeting Request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the requested special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board). (e) The business transacted at any special meeting of shareholders is limited to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of the meeting given pursuant to this Section 1.3. Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, the Board may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at a special meeting. Except in accordance with this Section 1.3, 

16 stockholders shall not be permitted to propose business to be brought before a special meeting of the stockholders. (f) A Special Meeting Request must be delivered by hand or by mail or courier service, postage prepaid, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. (g) A Special Meeting Request shall be valid only if it is signed and dated by each stockholder of record submitting the Special Meeting Request and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made, or such stockholder s or beneficial owner s duly authorized agent (each, a Requesting Stockholder ), and includes (A) a statement of the specific purpose(s) of the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (B) in the case of any director nominations proposed to be presented at the special meeting, the information required by Section 1.1(c); and (C) in the case of any matter (other than a director nomination) proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, the information required by Section 1.1(b). (h) The Special Meeting Request must also include (A) an agreement by the Requesting Stockholders to notify the Corporation promptly in the event of any disposition prior to the time of the special meeting of any shares included within any Requesting Stockholder s Net Long Beneficial Ownership as of the date on which the Special Meeting Request was delivered to the Secretary; (B) an acknowledgement that prior to the special meeting any disposition of shares of the Corporation s common stock included within any Requesting Stockholder s Net Long Beneficial Ownership as of the date on which the Special Meeting Request was delivered to the Secretary shall be deemed to be a revocation of such Special Meeting Request with respect to such disposed shares and that any decrease in the Requesting Stockholders aggregate Net Long Beneficial Ownership to less than the Minimum Holding shall be deemed to be a revocation of such Special Meeting Request; and (C) documentary evidence that the Requesting Stockholders (or the beneficial owners on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is made) had Net Long Beneficial Ownership of the Minimum Holding as of the date of delivery of the Special Meeting Request to the Secretary. (i) The Requesting Stockholders on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made shall further update and supplement the information provided in the Special Meeting Request, if necessary, as set forth in Section 1.1(e). (j) If none of the Requesting Stockholders appears or sends a duly authorized agent to present the business specified in the Special Meeting Request to be presented for consideration, the Corporation need not present such business for a vote at the special meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such business may have been received by the Corporation. (k) With respect to this Section 1.3, a stockholder must comply with all applicable provisions of these By-Laws and all requirements of Delaware law and the 1934 Act. (l) In the event the Board of Directors calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, nominations of persons for election to 

17 the Board of Directors may be made by any stockholder that is a stockholder of record of the Corporation (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such nomination is proposed to be made, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation) at the time of giving the notice provided for in this Section 1.3(l), that is entitled to vote at such meeting and that has given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with this Section 1.3(l). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with this Section 1.3(l). To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the later of (i) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the tenth (10th) day following (1) the day on which the notice containing the date of the special meeting is provided by the Corporation or (2) public disclosure of the special meeting date was made, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that any such notice which is received later than the fifth (5th) business day prior to the meeting may be disregarded. In no event shall any adjournment, deferral or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as provided above. To be in proper written form, such stockholder s notice shall set forth all of the information described in, and otherwise be in compliance with, Section 1.1(c) of these By-laws. In addition, any stockholder who submits a notice pursuant to this Section 1.3(l) is required to update and supplement the information disclosed in such notice, if necessary, in accordance with Section 1.1(e). If any information submitted pursuant to this Section 1.3(l) by any stockholder proposing one or more nominees for election as a director at a special meeting of stockholders is inaccurate in any material respect, such information shall be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this Section 1.3(l). The presiding person at the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these By-laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. (m) For the purposes of this Section 1.3, the following definitions shall apply: (i) An Affiliate of a person shall mean another person that, directly or indirectly through one of more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such person. (ii) An Associate of a person shall mean (i) any corporation or organization (other than a majority-owned subsidiary of such person) of which such person is an officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of any class of equity securities; (ii) any trust or other estate in which such person has a substantial beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (iii) any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same home as such person or who is a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its parents or subsidiaries. (iii) Net Long Beneficial Ownership shall mean the shares of stock of the Corporation that such person or, if such person is a nominee, custodian or other agent that is holding the shares on behalf of another person (the beneficial owner ), that such beneficial owner 

18 would then be deemed to own pursuant to Rule 200(b) under the 1934 Act, excluding, at any time, any shares as to which such stockholder or beneficial owner does not then have the right to vote or direct the vote and excluding, at any time, any shares as to which such person or beneficial owner (or any Affiliate or Associate of such person or beneficial owner) had directly or indirectly entered into (or caused to be entered into) and not yet terminated a derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares, and further subtracting from any person s ownership of shares at any time such person s (and such person s Affiliates and Associates short position (as defined pursuant to Rule 14e-4(a) under the 1934 Act), all as the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith. Section 1.4 Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice. (a) Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice of the meeting shall be given by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer (if any), the President, the Secretary or the other persons calling the meeting, and shall state the place, date and hour, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be directed to each stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given at the time specified in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. (b) Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given to the stockholders under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws, a written waiver signed by a stockholder entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by a stockholder entitled to notice, whether before, at or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. 

19 Section 1.5 Quorum. The presence at any meeting, in person, by means of remote communication in a manner, if any, authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, or represented by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required with respect to a particular matter, the presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of such class or classes then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum with respect to a vote on such matter. A quorum, once established at a meeting, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. Section 1.6 Adjournments. In the absence of a quorum, a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy at a meeting, or, if no stockholder entitled to vote is present in person or by proxy, any officer entitled to act as chairman or secretary of such meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another time or place. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are provided in a manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. In no event will the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described in paragraphs (b) or (c) of Section 1.1 of these By- Laws. Section 1.7 Organization. The Chairman of the Board, or if there is no Chairman of the Board or in his absence or disability, the Chief Executive Officer, or if there is no Chief Executive Officer or in his absence or disability, the President, or in the absence or disability of all of them, a presiding person appointed by the Board of Directors, shall act as the presiding person of all meetings of stockholders. The Secretary or, in his absence or disability, any Assistant Secretary, or, in the absence of all of them, a secretary appointed by the presiding person of the meeting, shall act as secretary at all meetings of stockholders. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate including, without limitation, such guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the presiding person at any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules shall apply: (a) The presiding person may ask or require that anyone not a bona fide stockholder or duly authorized proxy leave the meeting. 

20 (b) The presiding person may propose any motion for vote. The order of business at all meetings of stockholders shall be determined by the presiding person. (c) The presiding person may impose any reasonable limits with respect to participation in the meeting by stockholders, including, without limitation, limits on the amount of time that may be taken up at the meeting by the remarks or questions of any stockholder, limits on the number of questions a stockholder may ask and limits as to the subject matter and timing of questions and remarks by stockholders. Section 1.8 Voting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder which is registered in his name on the record date for the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, for all matters the affirmative vote (which need not be by ballot) of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter of such vote shall be the act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter of such vote shall be the act of such class or classes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vote required for the election of directors shall be as provided in Section 3.2 of Article III. Section 1.9 Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate actions in writing may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors. Section 1.10 Stockholder List. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address and number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. Section 1.11 Inspectors of Election. In advance of any stockholders meeting, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. 

21 Section 1.12 Fixing the Record Date. So that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and shall not be more than 60 nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed by the Board of Directors. So that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and (a) in the case of a written consent, shall not exceed by more than ten (10) days the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, or (b) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. Only those stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed by the Board of Directors. ARTICLE II CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required by law or these By-laws to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation as required by law. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not so consented in writing. ARTICLE III BOARD OF DIRECTORS Section 3.1 Number. The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more directors, as fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law. Section 3.2 Election and Term of Office. 

22 (a) Directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and will hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. (b) In an uncontested election of directors, each director of the Corporation shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors; provided, however, in a contested election, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section 3.2: (i) an uncontested election is an election in which the number of nominees for director is not greater than the number to be elected and (ii) a contested election is an election in which the number of nominees for director is greater than the number to be elected. (c) Following any uncontested election, any incumbent director who was a nominee and who did not receive a majority of the votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors (a majority vote ), shall promptly tender his or her offer of resignation to the Board for consideration by the Board if such director has not previously submitted a conditional offer of resignation. A recommendation on whether or not to accept such resignation offer shall be made by a committee of independent directors that has been delegated the responsibility of recommending nominees for director for appointment or election to the Board, or (1) if each member of such committee did not receive the required majority vote or (2) if no such committee has been appointed, a majority of the Board shall appoint a special committee of independent directors for such purpose of making a recommendation to the Board (the Nominating Committee ). If no independent directors received the required majority vote, the Board shall act on the resignation offers. Within sixty (60) days following certification of the stockholder vote, the Nominating Committee shall recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offer of resignation. In determining whether or not to recommend that the Board accept any resignation offer, the Nominating Committee shall be entitled to consider all factors believed relevant by such Committee s members, including without limitation: (1) any stated reasons for the director not receiving the required majority vote and whether the underlying cause or causes are curable; (2) the factors, if any, set forth in the guidelines or other policies that are to be considered by the Nominating Committee in evaluating potential candidates for the Board as such factors relate to each director who has so offered his or her resignation; (3) the length of service of such director; (4) the effect of such resignation on the Corporation s compliance with any law, rule, regulation, stock exchange listing standards, or contractual obligations; (5) such director s contributions to the Corporation; and (6) any other factors that the Nominating Committee believes are in the best interests of the Corporation. The Board shall act on the Nominating Committee s recommendation and publicly disclose the decision and reasons therefor, by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication, within ninety (90) days following certification of the stockholder vote. In determining whether or not to accept any resignation offer, the Board shall take into account the factors considered by the Nominating Committee and any additional information and factors that the Board believes to be relevant. 

23 (d) If any director s resignation offer is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until the director s earlier death, resignation, or removal. If a director s resignation offer is accepted by the Board pursuant to this Section 3.2, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.3 of this Article III or may decrease the size of the Board pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Article III. Section 3.3 Vacancies and Additional Directorship. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, when one or more directors shall resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to be effective upon the effectiveness of such resignation or resignations. Section 3.4 Meetings. (a) Regular Meeting. The Board of Directors may by resolution provide for the holding of regular meetings for the election of officers and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, and may fix the times and places at which such meetings shall be held. Notice of regular meetings shall not be required to be given, provided that whenever the time or place of regular meetings shall be fixed or changed, notice of such action shall be given promptly by mail, facsimile, telegram, radio, cable, telephone, electronic mail or personal delivery to each director who shall not have been present at the meeting at which such action was taken, addressed, sent, delivered or communicated to him at his residence or usual place of business. (b) Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer (if any), the President or one-third of the directors then in office, except that when the Board of Directors consists of one director, such director may call a special meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, at least five (5) days before the day on which such meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by facsimile, telegram, radio or cable, electronic mail or telephoned or delivered to him personally, not later than twenty-four (24) hours before the day on which such meeting is to be held. Such notice shall state the time and place of such meeting, but need not state the purpose thereof, unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws. (c) Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given to the directors under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws, a written waiver, signed by the director entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a director attends a meeting for the express 

24 purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation. (d) Participation by Conference Call. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in any meeting of the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Section 3.5 Quorum; Voting. Unless the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation provides otherwise, at each meeting of the Board of Directors a majority of the total number of members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except that when the Board consists of only one director, one director shall constitute a quorum. Unless otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws, a vote of the majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board. Section 3.6 Adjournment. A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. Notice of any adjournment of a meeting of the Board of Directors to another time or place shall be given to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment and, unless such time and place are announced at such meeting, to the directors who were present. Section 3.7 Organization. The Chairman of the Board, or if there is no Chairman of the Board or in his absence or disability, the Chief Executive Officer, or if there is no Chief Executive Officer or in his absence or disability, the President, or in the absence or disability of all of them, a chairman appointed by the directors present at such meeting, shall act as the presiding person at meetings of directors. The Secretary, or in his absence or disability, any Assistant Secretary, or in the absence of all of them, a secretary appointed by the presiding person of the meeting, shall act as secretary at all meetings of the Board of Directors. Section 3.8 Action of Board Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and such writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board. Section 3.9 Manner of Acting. A member of the Board of Directors shall, in the performance of his duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of the Corporation s officers or employees, or committees of the Board, or by any other person as to matters the director reasonably believes are within such other person s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation. Section 3.10 Resignation of Directors. Any director may resign at any time by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission of such resignation to the Board of Directors, the 

25 Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer (if any), the President, any Vice President or the Secretary. Unless otherwise specified in such notice, such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Board of Directors or any such officer, and acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Section 3.11 Removal of Directors. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a duly held meeting. Section 3.12 Compensation of Directors. Directors may receive such reasonable compensation for their services as directors, whether in the form of salary, a fixed fee for attendance at meetings, with expenses, if any, or other compensation, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Section 3.13 Interested Directors. No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if (a) the material facts as to his, her or their relationship or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, and the Board of Directors or a committee thereof in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum, (b) the material facts as to his, her or their relationship or interest as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders or (c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee that authorizes the contract or transaction. ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD Section 4.1 Designation and Powers. The Board of Directors may, by a resolution passed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. Any such committee, to the extent provided in such resolution and permitted by law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided, however, that no such committee shall have the power or authority to (a) amend the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, except as permitted by law, (b) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation, (c) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or 

26 exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation s property or assets, (d) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation, or a revocation of a dissolution, or (e) amend the By-laws of the Corporation.

Section 4.2 Term of Office. The term of office of the members of each committee shall be as fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, subject to these By-laws; provided, however, that any committee member who ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors shall ipso facto cease to be a member of any committee thereof. Section 4.3 Alternate Members and Vacancies. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee who, in the order specified by the Board of Directors, may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. If at a meeting of any committee one or more of the members thereof should he absent or disqualified, and if either the Board of Directors has not so designated any alternate member or members or the number of absent or disqualified members exceeds the number of alternate members who are present at such meeting, then the member or members of such committee (including alternates) present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another director to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. If any vacancy shall occur in any committee by reason of death, resignation, disqualification, removal or otherwise, the remaining member or members of such committee, so long as a quorum is present, may continue to act until such vacancy is filled by the Board of Directors.
