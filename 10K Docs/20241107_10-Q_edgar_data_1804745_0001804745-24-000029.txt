 restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs ). The Company granted new awards during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 including RSUs and PSUs. 
 Awards are eligible to vest provided that the employee remains in continuous service on each vesting date. The RSUs vest ratably each year on the anniversary date generally over a two -or period. The PSUs vest after a performance period. The number of PSUs that vest is contingent on the Company achieving certain performance goals, one being a performance condition and the other being a market condition. The number of PSU shares that vest may range from to of the original grant, based upon the level of performance. Certain awards are considered probable of meeting vesting requirements, and therefore, the Company has started recognizing expense. For both RSUs and PSUs, if the grantee s continuous service terminates for any reason, the grantee shall forfeit all rights, title, and interest in any unvested units as of the termination date. 
 The fair value of the total RSUs, performance-based PSUs, and market-based PSUs granted during the three months ended September 28, 2024 were million, million, and million, respectively.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis for Driven Brands Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries Driven Brands, the Company, we, us, or our should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. We operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year, which ends on the last Saturday in December. The three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were both 13 weeks periods. The nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were both 39 week periods. 
 
 Overview 
 Driven Brands is the largest automotive services company in North America with a growing and highly-franchised base of more than 5,100 locations across 49 U.S. states and 13 other countries. Our scaled, diversified platform fulfills an extensive range of core retail and commercial automotive needs, including paint, collision, glass, and repair services, as well as a variety of high-frequency services, such as oil changes and car washes. 
 We have continued to grow our base of consistent recurring revenue by adding new franchised and company-operated stores and same store sales growth. Driven Brands generated net revenue of approximately 592 million and 1.8 billion during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, an increase of 2 and 1 , respectively, compared to the prior year comparative periods, and system-wide sales of approximately 1.6 billion and 4.9 billion during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, an increase of 2 and 3 from the prior year comparative periods. 
 Although we have continued to experience total Company same store sales growth for 15 consecutive quarters through our diversified customer base and service offerings, we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing softening demand across several of our segments, primarily as a result of inflationary pressures, increased competition, industry dynamics, and negative weather patterns, including hurricanes. 
 Q3 2024 Three Months Ended Highlights and Key Performance Indicators 
 (as compared to same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted) 
 Net revenue increased 2 to 592 million, driven by higher product and service revenue due to an increase in system-wide sales, net new store growth, and a positive impact from foreign exchange. 
 Consolidated same store sales increased 1 . 
 The Company added 56 net new stores during the quarter. 
 Net loss decreased 784 million to 15 million or 0.09 loss per diluted share, primarily relating to decreased impairment charges, net new store growth, and improved margins across the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments, partially offset by increased employee related benefit costs, including share-based compensation expense, reduced margins within the Maintenance segment, and increased income tax expense. 
 Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) increased 40 to 42 million or 0.26 per diluted share. The increase was primarily due to net new store growth, and margin improvements across the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments, partially offset by increased employee related benefit costs and reduced margins within the Maintenance segment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 14 to 139 million. The increase was primarily due to net new store growth and margin improvements across the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments, partially offset by increased employee related benefit costs and reduced margins within the Maintenance segment. 
 Q3 2024 Nine Months Ended Highlights and Key Performance Indicators 
 (as compared to same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted) 
 Net revenue increased 1 to 1,775 million, driven by higher product and service revenue due to an increase in system-wide sales, net new store growth, and a positive impact from foreign exchange. 
 Consolidated same store sales increased less than 1 . 
 The Company added 121 net new stores during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Net Income increased 751 million to 19 million or 0.12 per diluted share, primarily relating to decreased impairment charges in the current period, net new store growth, improved operating margins within the Maintenance, Platform Services, and Paint, Collision Glass segments, and increased gains relating to the sale of assets and businesses, partially 
 23 

offset by increased employee related benefit costs, including share-based compensation expense, increased income tax expense, and reduced margins within the Car Wash segment. 
 Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) increased 20 to 138 million or 0.84 per diluted share. The increase was primarily due to net new store growth and margin improvements within our Maintenance, Platform Services, and Paint, Collision Glass segments as well as decreased interest expense, partially offset by increased employee related benefit costs and reduced margins within the Car Wash segment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 8 to 422 million. The increase was primarily due to net new store growth and improved margins within our Maintenance, Platform Services, and Paint, Collision Glass segments, partially offset by increased employee related benefit costs and reduced margins within the Car Wash segment. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 Key measures that we use in assessing our business and evaluating our segments include the following: 
 System-wide sales. System-wide sales represent the total of net sales for our franchised, independently-operated, and company-operated stores. This measure allows management to better assess the total size and health of each segment, our overall store performance, and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Sales at franchised stores are not included as revenue in our results from operations, but rather, we include franchise royalties and fees that are derived from sales at franchised stores. 
 Store count. Store count reflects the number of franchised, independently-operated, and company-operated stores open at the end of the reporting period. Management reviews the number of new, closed, acquired, and divested stores to assess net unit growth and drivers of trends in system-wide sales, franchise royalties and fees revenue, company-operated store sales, and independently-operated store sales. 
 Same store sales. Same store sales reflect the change in sales year-over-year for the same store base. We define the same store base to include all franchised, independently-operated, and company-operated stores open for comparable weeks during the given fiscal period in both the current and prior year, which may be different from how others define similar terms. This measure highlights the performance of existing stores, while excluding the impact of new store openings and closures and acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for acquisition related costs, equity compensation, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency transaction related gains or losses, store opening costs, cloud computing amortization, and certain non-recurring and non-core, infrequent or unusual charges. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance of our segments and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a performance metric utilized by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to and assess performance of our segments. Refer to Note 5 in our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of income before taxes to Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures throughout this quarterly report, as described further below, to provide investors with additional useful information about our financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted Net Income/Adjusted Earnings per Share . We define Adjusted Net Income as net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for acquisition related costs, equity compensation, loss on debt extinguishment, cloud computing amortization, and certain non-recurring, non-core, infrequent or unusual charges, amortization related to acquired intangible assets, and the tax effect of the adjustments. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average shares outstanding. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions.

 Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for acquisition related costs, equity compensation, loss on debt extinguishment, cloud computing amortization, and certain non-recurring, non-core, infrequent or unusual charges. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Loss 
 We recognized a net loss of 15 million, or 0.09 loss per diluted share, for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to a net loss of 799 million, or 4.83 loss per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement of approximately 784 million was primarily due to the following: 
 a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the prior year period of 851 million; 
 non-cash asset impairment charges of 24 million in the current period relating to assets held for sale as well as property and equipment and right-of-use assets at closed stores compared to 111 million in the prior year period, which primarily related to Car Wash assets including approved store closures, underperforming stores, and assets held for sale; 
 positive same store sales across all segments, net new store openings, primarily within the Maintenance segment, and operating margin improvements within the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments; and 
 a positive impact from foreign exchange. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 an increase in tax expense of 162 million, primarily relating to impairment charges in the prior year; 
 increased payroll and employee benefit costs, including 10 million of additional share-based compensation expense primarily relating to the modification of pre-IPO awards in the fourth quarter of 2023; and 
 decreased operating margins within the Maintenance segment. 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 Adjusted net income was 42 million, or 0.26 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 30 million, or 0.18 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase of 12 million was primarily due to the following: 
 positive same store sales across all segments, net new store openings, primarily within the Maintenance segment, and operating margin improvements within the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments; and 
 a positive impact from foreign exchange. 
 The increases were partially offset by: 
 increased payroll and employee benefit costs; and 
 decreased operating margins within the Maintenance segment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 139 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 122 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 17 million in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to: 
 positive same store sales across all segments, net new store openings, primarily within the Maintenance segment, and operating margin improvements within the Paint, Collision Glass, Car Wash, and Platform Services segments. 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 increased payroll and employee benefit costs; and 
 decreased operating margins within the Maintenance segment.

To facilitate the review of our results of operations, the following tables set forth our financial results for the periods indicated. All information is derived from the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain percentages presented in this section have been rounded, therefore, totals may not equal the sum of the line items in the tables below. 
 Net Revenue 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) 
 September 28, 2024 of Net Revenues September 30, 2023 of Net Revenues Franchise royalties and fees 49,475 8.3 47,362 8.1 Company-operated store sales 388,132 65.7 389,041 67.0 Independently-operated store sales 49,959 8.4 43,582 7.5 Advertising fund contributions 26,823 4.5 27,121 4.7 Supply and other revenue 77,290 13.1 73,928 12.7 Total net revenue 591,679 100.0 581,034 100.0 
 Franchise Royalties and Fees 
 Franchise royalties and fees increased 2 million, or 4 , primarily due to the addition of 101 net new franchised stores and increased franchise system-wide sales of 27 million, or 2 , driven by franchise same store sales growth within the Paint, Collision Glass and Maintenance segments, partially offset by decreased franchise system-wide sales within the Platform Services Segment. 
 Company-operated Store Sales 
 Company-operated store sales decreased less than 1 million of which 20 million and 8 million related to a decrease in the Paint, Collision Glass and Car Wash segments, respectively, partially offset by an increase of 27 million within the Maintenance segment. The sales decrease in the Paint, Collision Glass segment was primarily associated with the sale of nine company-operated stores to a franchisee in the current year, as well as decreased company-operated same store sales due to reduced volume. The decrease in Car Wash sales is primarily due to a decrease in company-operated same store sales primarily relating to lower volume from our retail customers as a result of unfavorable weather conditions, partially offset by an increase in membership revenue. The sales increase in the Maintenance segment was primarily due to same store sales growth and 71 net new company-operated stores. In total, the Company added 11 net new company-operated stores year-over-year. 
 Independently-operated Store Sales

 Car Wash segment net revenue decreased 21 million, or 4 , driven primarily by a 26 million, or 9 , decrease in company-operated store sales from the net reduction of 30 company-operated stores during the prior 12 months and a decrease in same store sales primarily relating to lower volume. Independently-operated store sales increased 6 million due to same store sales growth as a result of improved price realization, new product offerings, and favorable impacts from foreign exchange. 
 Car Wash is comprised of car wash sites throughout the U.S., Europe, and Australia with varying geographical, economical, and political factors, which could impact the results of the business. Our U.S. Car Wash locations have experienced softening demand, increased competitive pressures, and negative weather patterns, which have contributed to negative company-operated same store sales and could result in future asset impairment charges. 
 Car Wash Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 13 million, or 13 , primarily driven by decreased same store sales within company-operated stores, partially offset by positive same store sales within the independently operated stores and improved inventory cost management.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash flow from operations, supplemented with our long-term borrowings and revolving credit facilities, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to grow our business. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations, acquisitions, company-operated store development, other general corporate needs, and the additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. We expect to continue to have access to the capital markets at acceptable terms. However, this could be adversely affected by many factors including macroeconomic factors, a downgrade of our credit rating, or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. 
 Driven Brands Funding, LLC (the Issuer ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Driven Brands Canada Funding Corporation (along with the Issuer, the Co-Issuers are subject to certain quantitative covenants related to debt service coverage and leverage ratios in connection with our securitization senior notes. Our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility also have certain qualitative covenants. As of September 28, 2024, the Co-Issuers and Driven Holdings were in material compliance with all such covenants under their respective credit agreements. 
 On July 29, 2024, the Company issued 275 million of 2024-1 Senior Notes as well as replaced the 2019 VFN with a 400 million 2024 VFN. Proceeds from the 2024-1 Senior Notes were primarily used to repay the Company s 2018-1 Senior Notes. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company s debt. 
 At September 28, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of 655 million, which included 204 million in cash and cash equivalents and 374 million and 77 million of undrawn capacity on its 2024 VFN and Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. This does not include the additional 135 million Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Notes that expand our variable funding note borrowing capacity when the company elects to exercise it, assuming certain conditions continue to be met. 
 The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 208,508 212,033 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 51,426 (361,207) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (226,661) 147,850 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 71 365 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash included in advertising fund assets 33,344 (959) 
 
 In the third quarter 2024 earnings release on October 31, 2024, we reported net cash provided by operating activities of 175 million, and net cash provided by investing activities of 85 million, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. Both amounts have been revised to reflect the actual cash movement during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 209 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 212 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to costs associated with improvements to our IT infrastructure, including the ERP implementation, offset by net working capital improvements during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 51 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 361 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily due to a 263 million decrease in capital expenditures, 256 million proceeds from the sale or disposal of businesses and fixed assets, primarily consisting of 161 million from the sale of assets held for sale, 78 million from the sale of our Canadian distribution business, and 18 million from the sale of nine company-operated collision stores to a franchisee, as well as a 51 million decrease in net cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by a 154 million decrease in proceeds from sale leaseback transactions. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 227 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily related to repayments of long-term debt, including finance leases, of 427 million, Tax Receivable Agreement payments of 38 million, 
 46 

net repayments on the Revolving Credit facility of 25 million and debt issuance costs of 10 million, partially offset by the 2024-1 Senior Notes issuance of 275 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was 148 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to net debt borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility of 215 million, partially offset by share repurchases of 50 million, and repayments of long-term debt, including finance leases of 23 million. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company s debt. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 We expect to be able to utilize certain tax benefits which are related to periods prior to the effective date of the Company s initial public offering, which we therefore attribute to our existing shareholders. We expect that these tax benefits i.e ., the Pre-IPO and IPO-Related Tax Benefits) will reduce the amount of tax that we and our subsidiaries would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement which provides our Pre-IPO shareholders with the right to receive payment by us of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. and Canadian federal, state, local, and provincial income tax that we and our subsidiaries actually realize as a result of the utilization of the Pre-IPO and IPO-Related Tax Benefits or divests. The Company recorded a current tax receivable liability of 56 million as of December 30, 2023 and a non-current tax receivable liability of 134 million and 118 million as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. We made payments of approximately 38 million under the Tax Receivable Agreement in 2024. 
 For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by reference to the reduction in the liability for income taxes resulting from the utilization of the Pre-IPO and IPO-Related Tax Benefits. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the effective date of the Company s initial public offering and will continue until the Pre-IPO and IPO-Related Tax Benefits have been utilized, accelerated, or expired. 
 Because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. The securitized debt facility may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, which could affect our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement because of restrictions under our outstanding indebtedness, such payments will be deferred and will generally accrue interest. As of July 1, 2023, interest accrues at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin or SOFR plus an applicable term adjustment plus 1.0 . To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any other reason, such payments will generally accrue interest at a rate of SOFR plus an applicable term adjustment plus 5.0 per annum until paid.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the design effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 28, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on evaluation of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed effectively and will provide a reasonable level of assurance. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, the Company implemented a new cloud-based enterprise resource planning ERP system including modules for general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets, cash management, indirect procurement, supply chain and inventory management, and consolidations for the majority of our business operations. We will continue to evaluate business units and processes utilizing systems other than the new ERP system for transition in future periods. As a result of the ERP implementation, certain internal controls over financial reporting have been automated, modified, or implemented to address the new control environment and processes associated with the ERP system. 
 With the exception of the implementation of the ERP modules outlined above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recently completed quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

All Class A-1 Notes of any Series shall be issued in the form of Definitive Notes or Uncertificated Notes. The applicable Series Supplement shall set forth the legend relating to the restrictions on transfer of such Definitive Notes (or transfer and de-registration with respect to Uncertificated Notes) and such other restrictions as may be applicable. (b) With respect to the Notes of any Series issued in the form of typewritten Notes representing Book-Entry Notes, if (i) (A) the Co-Issuers advise the Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency with respect to any such Series of Notes is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities under the applicable Depository Agreement and (B) the Trustee or the Co-Issuers are unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) after the occurrence of a Rapid Amortization Event, with respect to any Series of Notes Outstanding, Note Owners holding a beneficial interest in excess of 50 of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of such Series of Notes advise the Trustee and the applicable Clearing Agency through the applicable Clearing Agency Participants in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through the applicable Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests of such Note Owners, in each case, the Trustee shall notify all Note Owners of such Series, through the applicable Clearing Agency Participants, of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes (or Uncertificated Notes) to Note Owners of such Series. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the Notes of such Series by the applicable Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions from the applicable Clearing Agency for registration, the Co-Issuers shall execute (other than with respect to Uncertificated Notes) and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon receipt of a Company Order, and deliver an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Notes in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Neither the Co-Issuers nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may each conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes of such Series of Notes, all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the applicable Clearing Agency shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive Notes, and the Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes of such Series as Noteholders of such Series hereunder and under the applicable Series Supplement. Section 2.14 Cancellation. The Co-Issuers may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered (or registered in the case of Uncertificated Notes) hereunder which a Co-Issuer or an Affiliate thereof may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. Immediately upon the delivery of any Notes by the Co-Issuers to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.14 (or as otherwise set forth in any applicable Series 

17 Supplement with respect to Uncertificated Notes), the security interest of the Secured Parties in such Notes shall automatically be deemed to be released by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Co-Issuers any and all documentation reasonably requested and prepared by the Co-Issuers at their expense to evidence such automatic release. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel (or de-register) all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation. Except as provided in any Note Purchase Agreement executed and delivered in connection with the issuance of any Series or any Class of any Series of Notes, the Co-Issuers may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that the Co-Issuers have redeemed or paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (or de-registration). All cancelled Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the Trustee s standard disposition procedures unless the Co-Issuers shall direct that cancelled Notes be returned to either Co-Issuer for destruction pursuant to a Company Order. No cancelled (or de-registered) Notes may be reissued. No provision of this Base Indenture or any Supplement that relates to prepayment procedures, penalties, fees, make-whole payments or any other related matters shall be applicable to any Notes cancelled (or de-registered) pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 2.14. Section 2.15 Principal and Interest. (a) The principal of and premium, if any, on each Series of Notes shall be due and payable at the times and in the amounts set forth in the applicable Series Supplement and in accordance with the Priority of Payments. (b) Each Series of Notes shall accrue interest as provided in the applicable Series Supplement and such interest shall be due and payable for such Series on each Quarterly Payment Date in accordance with the Priority of Payments. (c) Except as provided in the following sentence, the Person in whose name any Note is registered at the close of business on any Record Date with respect to a Quarterly Payment Date for such Note shall be entitled to receive the principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such Quarterly Payment Date notwithstanding the cancellation (or de-registration) of such Note upon any registration of transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note subsequent to such Record Date. Any interest payable at maturity shall be paid to the Person to whom the principal of such Note is payable. (d) Pursuant to the authority of the Paying Agent under Section 2.6(a)(v), except as otherwise provided pursuant to any Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement to the extent that the Paying Agent has been notified in writing of such exception by the Co-Issuers or the applicable Class A-1 Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent shall make all payments of interest on the Notes net of any applicable withholding taxes and Noteholders shall be treated as having received as payments of interest any amounts withheld with respect to such withholding taxes. (e) For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada) as-applied to the Canadian Co-Issuer, the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under the Indenture that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. The rates of interest stipulated in the Indenture or in any of the Notes as- applied to the Canadian Co-Issuer are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest as-applied to the Canadian Co-Issuer shall not apply to any interest calculation under the Indenture or under the Notes. (f) If any provision of the Indenture would oblige the Co-Issuers to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Noteholder in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be 

18 prohibited by Requirements of Law or would result in a receipt by that Noteholder of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by Requirements of Law or so result in a receipt by that Noteholder of interest at a criminal rate , such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary (but only to the extent necessary), by reducing any fees, commissions, costs, expenses, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to the affected Noteholder which would constitute interest for purposes of section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada). Section 2.16 Tax Treatment. The Co-Issuers have structured this Base Indenture and the Notes have been (or will be) issued with the intention that the Notes will qualify under applicable tax law in the United States as indebtedness of the Co-Issuers or, if a Co-Issuer is treated as a division of another entity for applicable tax purposes, such other entity, and any entity acquiring any direct or indirect interest in any Note by acceptance of its Notes (or, in the case of a Note Owner, by virtue of such Note Owner s acquisition of a beneficial interest therein) agrees to treat the Notes (or beneficial interests therein) (or registration of an Uncertificated Note) for all purposes of federal, state, provincial, territorial and local and other income or franchise taxes, and any other tax imposed on or measured by income, as indebtedness of the Co-Issuers or, if a Co-Issuer is treated as a division of another entity for applicable tax purposes, such other entity. ARTICLE III SECURITY Section 3.1 Grant of Security Interest. (a) To secure its Obligations, each Co-Issuer (as of the date such Co-Issuer became party to this Base Indenture) hereby pledges, mortgages, charges, assigns, conveys, delivers, transfers and sets over to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and hereby grants to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in such Co-Issuer s right, title and interest in, to and under all of the following property to the extent now owned or at any time hereafter acquired by such Co-Issuer (collectively, the Indenture Collateral ): (i) the Equity Interests of any Person (including, without limitation, Franchisor Holdco, SPV Product Sales Holder, Radiator Product Sales Holder, Take 5 Properties, FUSA Properties, the Canadian SPV Franchising Entity LPs, Driven Canada Product Sourcing, Driven Canada Claims Management and the Canadian Securitization Entity GPs) owned by such Co-Issuer and all rights as a member, shareholder or partner of each such Person under the Charter Documents of each such Person; (ii) the Accounts of such Co-Issuer and all amounts on deposit in or otherwise credited to such Accounts; (iii) any rights in and to any Interest Reserve Letter of Credit; (iv) the books and records (whether in physical, electronic or other form) of such Co-Issuer; (v) the rights, powers, remedies and authorities of such Co-Issuer under each of the Transaction Documents (other than the Indenture and the Notes) to which it is a party; 

19 (vi) to the extent contributed to such Co-Issuer, all real and personal property of any Securitization-Owned Locations; (vii) any and all other property of such Co-Issuer now or hereafter acquired, including, without limitation, all accounts (including, without limitation, the rights to receive payments under short-term notes in respect of delinquent royalty payments from Franchisees), chattel paper, commercial tort claims, deposit accounts, futures accounts, documents, documents of title, equipment, fixtures, general intangibles, intangibles, health- care-insurance receivables, instruments, inventory, securities, securities accounts and other investment property and letter-of-credit rights; and (viii) all payments, proceeds, supporting obligations and accrued and future rights to payment with respect to the foregoing; provided that (A) the Indenture Collateral shall exclude the Collateral Exclusions; (B) the Co-Issuers shall not be required to pledge, and the Collateral shall not include, more than 65 of the Voting Equity Interests (and any rights associated with such Voting Equity Interests) of any foreign Subsidiary of any of the Co- Issuers that is a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes (other than the Canadian Securitization Entities); (C) the security interest in (1) the Senior Notes Interest Reserve Accounts, the Series Distribution Accounts with respect to the Senior Notes and the funds or securities deposited therein or credited thereto shall only be for the benefit of the Senior Noteholders and the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee for the Senior Noteholders, (2) the Senior Subordinated Notes Interest Reserve Accounts, the Series Distribution Accounts with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes and the funds or securities deposited therein or credited thereto shall only be for the benefit of the Senior Subordinated Noteholders and the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee for the Senior Subordinated Noteholders, (3) the Series Distribution Accounts with respect to the Subordinated Notes and the funds or securities deposited therein or credited thereto shall only be for the benefit of the Subordinated Noteholders and the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee for the Subordinated Noteholders, (4) each Pre-Funding Account and the funds or securities deposited therein or credited thereto shall only be for the benefit of the applicable Noteholders identified in the Series Supplement establishing such Pre-Funding Account and (5) each Pre-Funding Reserve Account and the funds or securities deposited therein or credited thereto shall only be for the benefit of the applicable Noteholders identified in the Series Supplement establishing such Pre-Funding Reserve Account; and (D) any cash collateral deposited by any Non-Securitization Entities with a Co-Issuer to secure such Non- Securitization Entities obligations under any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement will not constitute Collateral until such time (if any) as such Co-Issuer is entitled to withdraw such funds from the applicable bank account pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement to reimburse such Co-Issuer for any amounts due by such Non-Securitization Entities to such Co-Issuer pursuant to such Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement that such Non-Securitization Entities have not paid to such Co-Issuer in accordance with the terms thereof. The Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, acknowledges that it shall have no security interest in any Collateral Exclusions. If the grant of the security interests hereunder by the Canadian Co-Issuer with respect to any contract, Intellectual Property or Permit would result in the termination or breach of such contract, Intellectual Property or Permit or is otherwise prohibited or ineffective (whether by the terms thereof or under applicable law), then such contract, Intellectual Property or Permit shall not be subject to the security interests granted hereunder but shall be held in trust by the Canadian Co-Issuer for the benefit of the Trustee (for its own benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties) and, on the exercise by the Trustee of any of its rights or remedies under this Base Indenture following an Event of Default shall be assigned by the Canadian Co-Issuer as directed by the Trustee; provided that: (x) the security interests granted hereunder shall attach to such contract, Intellectual Property or Permit, or applicable portion thereof, immediately at such time as the condition causing such termination or breach is remedied, and (y) if a term in a contract that prohibits or restricts the 

20 grant of the security interests granted hereunder in the whole of an Account or Chattel Paper forming part of the Indenture Collateral is unenforceable against the Trustee under applicable law, then the exclusion from the security interests set out above shall not apply to such Account or Chattel Paper. In addition, the security interests granted hereunder do not attach to consumer goods (as defined in the PPSA) or extend to the last day of the term of any lease or agreement for lease of real property. Such last day shall be held by the Canadian Co-Issuer in trust for the Trustee (for its own benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties) and, on the exercise by the Trustee of any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement following an Event of Default, shall be assigned by the Canadian Co-Issuer as directed by the Trustee. For greater certainty, no Intellectual Property in any trade-mark, get-up or trade dress is presently assigned to the Trustee by sole virtue of the grant of the security interests contained herein. (b) The foregoing grant is made by each Co-Issuer in trust to secure the Obligations and to secure compliance by the Co-Issuers with the provisions of this Base Indenture and any Series Supplements, all as provided in this Base Indenture. The Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, acknowledges such grant, accepts the trusts under this Base Indenture in accordance with the provisions of this Base Indenture and agrees to perform its duties required in this Base Indenture. The Indenture Collateral shall secure the Obligations equally and ratably without prejudice, priority or distinction (except, with respect to any Series of Notes, as otherwise stated in the applicable Series Supplement or in the applicable provisions of this Base Indenture). (c) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that each certificated Equity Interest may be held by a custodian on behalf of the Trustee. (d) Each Co-Issuer confirms that value has been given by the Secured Parties to such Co-Issuer, that such Co-Issuer has rights in its Indenture Collateral existing at the date of this Base Indenture and that such Co-Issuer and the Trustee have not agreed to postpone the time for attachment of the security interests granted pursuant to Section 3.1(a) to any of the Indenture Collateral of such Co-Issuer. The security interests granted pursuant to Section 3.1(a) with respect to the Indenture Collateral of the Canadian Co- Issuer created by this Base Indenture shall have effect and be deemed to be effective whether or not the Obligations of the Canadian Co-Issuer or any part thereof are owing or in existence before or after or upon the date of this Base Indenture. Neither the execution and delivery of this Base Indenture nor the provision of any financial accommodation by any Secured Party shall oblige any Secured Party to make any financial accommodation or further financial accommodation available to the Canadian Co-Issuer or any other Person. Section 3.2 Certain Rights and Obligations of the Issuer Unaffected. (a) Notwithstanding the grant of the security interest in the Indenture Collateral hereunder to the Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, each Co-Issuer acknowledges that the U.S. Manager, on behalf of the Issuer and the Service Recipients organized in the United States or any State thereof, and the Canadian Manager, on behalf of the Canadian Co-Issuer and the Service Recipients organized in Canada or any province or territory thereof, shall, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Management Agreement, nevertheless have the right, subject to the Trustee s right to revoke such right, in whole or in part, in the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (i) to give, in accordance with the applicable Managing Standard, all consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals, extensions and waivers, if any, which are required or permitted to be given by such Co-Issuer under the Collateral Documents, and to enforce all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of such Co-Issuer under the Collateral Documents, (ii) to give, in accordance with the applicable Managing Standard, all consents, requests, notices, directions and approvals, if any, which are required or permitted to be given by such Co- Issuer under any IP License Agreement to which such Co-Issuer is a party and (iii) to take any other actions required or permitted under the terms of the applicable Management Agreement. 

21 (b) The grant of the security interest by each Co-Issuer in the Indenture Collateral to the Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties shall not (i) relieve such Co-Issuer from the performance of any term, covenant, condition or agreement on such Co-Issuer s part to be performed or observed under or in connection with any of the Collateral Documents or (ii) impose any obligation on the Trustee or any of the other Secured Parties to perform or observe any such term, covenant, condition or agreement on such Co-Issuer s part to be so performed or observed or impose any liability on the Trustee or any of the other Secured Parties for any act or omission on the part of such Co-Issuer or from any breach of any representation or warranty on the part of such Co-Issuer. (c) Each Co-Issuer hereby, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and each other Secured Party (including their respective directors, officers, employees and agents) from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses arising out of or resulting from the security interest granted hereby, whether arising by virtue of any act or omission on the part of such Co-Issuer, the other Co-Issuer or otherwise, including, without limitation, the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any other Secured Party in enforcing the Indenture or any other Transaction Document or preserving any of its rights to, or realizing upon, any of the Collateral; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnification shall not extend to any action by the Trustee or any other Secured Party which constitutes gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct by the Trustee or such other Secured Party or any other indemnified person hereunder. The indemnification provided for in this Section 3.2 shall survive the removal of, or a resignation by, any Person as Trustee as well as the termination of this Base Indenture or any Series Supplement. Section 3.3 Performance of Collateral Documents. Upon the occurrence of a default or breach (after giving effect to any applicable grace or cure periods) by any Person party to (a) a Transaction Document or (b) a Franchise Document (only if a Manager Termination Event with respect to the Manager of the related Co-Issuer or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), promptly following a request from the Trustee to do so and at the Co- Issuers expense, each Co-Issuer agrees to take all such lawful action as permitted under this Base Indenture as the Trustee (acting at the direction of the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative)) may reasonably request to compel or secure the performance and observance by such Person of its obligations to such Co-Issuer, and to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to such Co-Issuer to the extent and in the manner directed by the Trustee (acting at the direction of the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative)), including, without limitation, the transmission of notices of default and the institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or secure performance by such Person of its obligations thereunder. If (i) either Co-Issuer shall have failed, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the direction of the Trustee, to take commercially reasonable action to accomplish such directions of the Trustee, (ii) any such Co-Issuer refuses to take any such action, as reasonably determined by the Trustee in good faith, or (iii) the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) reasonably determines that such action must be taken immediately, in any such case the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) may, but shall not be obligated to, take, and the Trustee shall take (if so directed by the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative)), at the expense of the Co-Issuers, such previously directed action and any related action permitted under this Base Indenture which the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) thereafter determines is appropriate (without the need under this provision or any other provision under this Base Indenture to direct either Co-Issuer to take such action), on behalf of the Co-Issuers and the Secured Parties. 

22 Section 3.4 Stamp, Other Similar Taxes and Filing Fees. Each Co-Issuer shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and each other Secured Party from any present or future claim for liability for any stamp, documentary or other similar tax, and any penalties or interest and expenses with respect thereto, that may be assessed, levied or collected by any jurisdiction in connection with the Indenture, any other Transaction Document or any Indenture Collateral. Each Co-Issuer shall, jointly and severally, pay, and indemnify and hold harmless each Secured Party against, any and all amounts in respect of all search, filing, recording and registration fees, taxes, excise taxes and other similar imposts that may be payable or determined to be payable in respect of the execution, delivery, performance and/or enforcement of the Indenture or any other Transaction Document. Section 3.5 Authorization to File Financing Statements. (a) Each Co-Issuer hereby irrevocably authorizes the Servicer on behalf of the Secured Parties at any time and from time to time to file or record in any filing office in any applicable jurisdiction financing statements, financing change statements, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Indenture Collateral, including, without limitation, any and all Securitization IP (to the extent set forth in Section 8.25(c)), to perfect the security interests of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties under this Base Indenture. Each Co-Issuer authorizes the filing of any such financing statement, financing change statement, document or instrument naming the Trustee as secured party and indicating that the Indenture Collateral includes all assets , all present and after-acquired personal property or words of similar effect or import regardless of whether any particular assets comprised in the Indenture Collateral fall within the scope of Article 9 of the UCC or the PPSA, as applicable, including, without limitation, any and all Securitization IP, or as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail. Each Co-Issuer agrees to furnish any information necessary to accomplish the foregoing promptly upon the Servicer s request. Each Co-Issuer also hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing on behalf of the Secured Parties of any financing statement and/or financing change statement with respect to the Indenture Collateral made prior to the date hereof. (b) Each Co-Issuer acknowledges that the Indenture Collateral includes certain rights of such Co-Issuer as a secured party under the Transaction Documents. Each Co-Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee as its representative with respect to all financing statements and/or financing change statements filed to perfect such security interests and authorizes the Servicer on behalf of the Secured Parties to make such filings as it deems necessary to reflect the Trustee as secured party of record with respect to such financing statements. (c) Each Co-Issuer acknowledges receipt of an executed copy of this Base Indenture and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waives the right to receive a copy of any financing statement or financing change statement registered in connection with this Base Indenture or any verification statement issued with respect to any such financing statement or financing change statement. Section 3.6 ULC Shares. The Canadian Co-Issuer acknowledges that certain of the Indenture Collateral of the Canadian Co-Issuer may in the future consist of ULC Shares, and that neither the Trustee nor any other Secured Party shall under any circumstances prior to realization thereon be a member or a shareholder , as applicable, of a ULC for the purposes of any ULC Laws. Therefore, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document, where the Canadian Co- Issuer is the registered owner of ULC Shares which are Indenture Collateral of the Canadian Co-Issuer, the Canadian Co-Issuer shall remain the sole registered owner of such ULC Shares until such time as such ULC Shares are effectively transferred into the name of the Trustee or its designee, any other Secured Party, or 

23 any other Person on the books and records of the applicable ULC. Accordingly, the Canadian Co-Issuer shall be entitled to receive and retain for its own account any dividend on or other distribution, if any, with respect to such ULC Shares (except for any dividend or distribution comprised of Canadian Collections required to be deposited to the Accounts in accordance with the terms hereof) and shall have the right to vote such ULC Shares and to control the direction, management and policies of the applicable ULC to the same extent as the Canadian Co-Issuer would if such ULC Shares were not pledged to the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant hereto. Nothing in this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document is intended to, and nothing in this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document shall, constitute the Trustee, any other Secured Party, or any other Person other than the Canadian Co-Issuer, a member or shareholder of a ULC for the purposes of any ULC Laws (whether listed or unlisted, registered or beneficial), until such time as notice is given to such the Canadian Co-Issuer and further steps are taken pursuant hereto or thereto so as to register the Trustee or its designee, any other Secured Party, or such other Person, as specified in such notice, as the holder of the ULC Shares. To the extent any provision hereof would have the effect of constituting the Trustee, its designee or any other Secured Party as a member or a shareholder, as applicable, of any ULC prior to such time, such provision shall be severed herefrom and shall be ineffective with respect to ULC Shares which are Indenture Collateral of the Canadian Co- Issuer without otherwise invalidating or rendering unenforceable this Base Indenture or invalidating or rendering unenforceable such provision insofar as it relates to Indenture Collateral of the Canadian Co- Issuer which is not ULC Shares. Except upon the exercise of rights of the Trustee to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of ULC Shares in accordance with this Base Indenture, the Canadian Co-Issuer shall not cause or permit, or enable any ULC in which it holds ULC Shares to cause or permit, the Trustee, its designee or any other Secured Party to: (a) be registered as a shareholder or member of such ULC; (b) have any notation entered in their favor in the share register of such ULC; (c) be held out as shareholders or members of such ULC; (d) receive, directly or indirectly, any dividends, property or other distributions from such ULC by reason of the grant of a security interest over the ULC Shares in favor of the Trustee; or (e) act as a shareholder of such ULC, or exercise any rights of a shareholder including the right to attend a meeting of shareholders of such ULC or to vote its ULC Shares.

(b) Other than the security interest granted to the Trustee hereunder, pursuant to the other Transaction Documents or any other Permitted Lien, no Co-Issuer nor any Guarantor has pledged, assigned, sold or granted a security interest in the Collateral. All action necessary (including the filing of UCC-1 financing statements, PPSA financing statements and/or financing change statements and filings with the USPTO, the USCO and the CIPO) to perfect, preserve, protect and evidence the Trustee s security interest in the Collateral in the United States and Canada has been, or shall be, duly and effectively taken, consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 7.13(a), Section 8.25(c) and Section 8.25(d), except as described on Schedule 8.11. No security agreement, financing statement, equivalent security or lien instrument or continuation statement or financing change statement authorized by any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor and listing such Co-Issuer or such Guarantor as debtor covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file or of record in any jurisdiction, except in respect of Permitted Liens or such as may have been filed, recorded or made by such Co-Issuer or such Guarantor in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties in connection with this Base Indenture and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreements, and no Co- Issuer nor any Guarantor has authorized any such filing. (c) All authorizations in this Base Indenture and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreements for the Trustee to endorse checks, instruments and securities and to execute financing statements, continuation statements, financing change statements, security agreements and other instruments with respect to the Collateral and to take such other actions with respect to the Collateral authorized by this Base Indenture and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreements are powers coupled with an interest and are irrevocable. Section 7.14 Transaction Documents. The Indenture Documents, the Account Agreements, the Depository Agreements and the other Transaction Documents are in full force and effect. There are no outstanding defaults thereunder nor have events occurred which, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder. Section 7.15 Non-Existence of Other Agreements. Other than as permitted by Section 8.22, (a) no Securitization Entity is a party to any contract or agreement of any kind or nature and (b) no Securitization Entity is subject to any material obligations or liabilities of any kind or nature in favor of any third party, including, without limitation, Contingent Obligations. No U.S. Securitization Entity has engaged in any activities since its formation (other than those incidental to its formation, the authorization and the issuance of any Series of Notes, the execution of the Transaction Documents to which such Securitization Entity is a party and the performance of the activities referred to in or contemplated by such agreements). Section 7.16 Compliance with Contractual Obligations and Laws. No Service Recipient is in violation of (a) its Charter Documents, (b) any Requirement of Law with respect to such Service Recipient or (c) any Contractual Obligation with respect to such Service Recipient except, solely with respect to clauses (b) and (c), to the extent such violation could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

83 Section 7.17 Other Representations. All representations and warranties of each Service Recipient made in each Transaction Document to which it is a party are true and correct (i) if qualified as to materiality, in all respects and (ii) if not qualified as to materiality, in all material respects (unless stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all respects or in all material respects, as applicable, as of such earlier date), and are repeated herein as though fully set forth herein. Section 7.18 Insurance. The Securitization Entities maintain the insurance coverages (or self-insure for such risks) described on Schedule 7.18 hereto, in such amounts and covering such risks as is adequate for the conduct of their respective businesses and the value of their respective properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries. All policies of insurance of the Securitization Entities are in full force and effect, and the Securitization Entities are in compliance with the terms of such policies in all material respects. None of the Securitization Entities has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All such insurance is primary coverage, all premiums therefor due on or before the date hereof have been paid in full, and the terms and conditions thereof are no less favorable to the Securitization Entities than the terms and conditions of insurance maintained by their Affiliates that are not Securitization Entities. Section 7.19 Environmental Matters. (a) None of the Service Recipients is subject to any liabilities or obligations pursuant to any Environmental Law or with respect to any Materials of Environmental Concern that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) There is no judicial, administrative, or arbitral proceeding (including, without limitation, any notice of violation or alleged violation) under or relating to any Environmental Law to which any Service Recipient is, or to the knowledge of any Service 

84 Recipient will be, named as a party that is pending or, to the knowledge of any Service Recipient, threatened. (iv) No Service Recipient has received any written request for information, or been notified that it is a potentially responsible party, under or relating to the U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, or any other Environmental Law, or with respect to any Materials of Environmental Concern. (v) No Service Recipient has entered into or agreed to any consent decree, order, or settlement or other agreement, or is subject to any judgment, decree, or order or other agreement, in any judicial, administrative, arbitral, or other forum for dispute resolution, relating to compliance with or liability under any Environmental Law. Section 7.20 Intellectual Property.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.20, no action or proceeding is pending or, to any Co-Issuer s knowledge, threatened that seeks to limit, cancel or challenge the validity of any Securitization IP, or the use thereof, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (d) No Co-Issuer has made and will not hereafter make any assignment, pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or transfer of any of the Securitization IP other than Permitted Liens, Permitted Asset Dispositions and Permitted Brand Dispositions under Section 8.12 and Section 8.16. Section 7.21 Payments on the Notes. Payments on the Notes will not depend primarily on cash flow from self-liquidating financial assets within the meaning of Section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act.

85 the Code, the Tax Act or any applicable federal, state, provincial, territorial, local or foreign law by any Person from a payment to any Noteholder of interest or principal or premium, if any, shall be considered as having been paid by the Issuer to such Noteholder for all purposes of the Indenture and the Notes.

Section 8.2 Maintenance of Office or Agency. (a) The Co-Issuers will maintain an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, the Registrar or co-registrar) where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange (or de-registration), where notices and demands to or upon the Co-Issuers in respect of the Notes and the Indenture may be served, and where, at any time when the Co-Issuers are obligated to make a payment of principal of, and premium, if any, on the Notes, the Notes may be surrendered for payment (or de-registered). The Co-Issuers will give prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Servicer of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency.

The Co-Issuers will, and will cause each other Service Recipient to, pay and discharge and fully perform, at or before maturity, all of their respective material obligations and liabilities, including, without limitation, Tax liabilities and other governmental claims levied or imposed upon any Service Recipient or upon the income, properties or operations of any Service Recipient, judgments, settlement agreements and all obligations of each Service Recipient under the Collateral Documents, except where the same may be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings (and without derogation from the material obligations of the Co-Issuers hereunder and the Guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreements regarding the protection of the Collateral from Liens (other than Permitted Liens)), and will maintain, in accordance with GAAP, reserves as appropriate for the accrual of any of the same. Section 8.4 Maintenance of Existence. Each Co-Issuer will, and will cause each other Service Recipient to, maintain its existence as a limited liability company, corporation or limited partnership validly existing and in good standing (or its equivalent) under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and duly qualified (and licensed to the extent applicable) under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer will, and will cause each other U.S. Securitization Entity (other than any such Future Securitization Entity organized in the United States, any State thereof or the

Section 8.7 Actions under the Transaction Documents. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.7(d), no Co-Issuer will, nor will it permit any other Service Recipient to, take any action that would permit any Driven Brands Entity or any other Person party to a Transaction Document to have the right to refuse to perform any of its respective obligations under any of the Transaction Documents or that would result in the amendment, waiver, hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any Transaction Document. 

87 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.7(d), no Co-Issuer will, nor will it permit any other Service Recipient to, take any action which would permit any other Person party to a Franchise Document to have the right to refuse to perform any of its respective obligations under such Franchise Document or that would result in the amendment, waiver, hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, such Franchise Document if such action when taken on behalf of any Service Recipient by the applicable Manager would constitute a breach by such Manager of the applicable Management Agreement. (c) No Co-Issuer will, nor will it permit any other Service Recipient to, without the prior written consent of the Control Party, exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege available to it with respect to any obligor under a Collateral Document or under any instrument or agreement included in the Collateral, take any action to compel or secure performance or observance by any such obligor of its obligations to such Co-Issuer or such other Service Recipient or give any consent, request, notice, direction or approval with respect to any such obligor if such action when taken on behalf of any Service Recipient by the applicable Manager would constitute a breach by such Manager of the applicable Management Agreement.

110 (a) such direction of time, method and place shall not be in conflict with any rule of law, the Servicing Standard or the Indenture; (b) the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) may take any other action deemed proper by the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) that is not inconsistent with such direction (as the same may be modified by the Control Party (with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative)); and (c) such direction shall be in writing; provided, further, that, subject to Section 10.1, the Trustee need not take any action that it determines might involve it in liability unless it has received an indemnity for such liability as provided herein. Section 9.9 Limitation on Suits. Any other provision of the Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, a Holder of Notes may pursue a remedy with respect to the Indenture or any other Transaction Document only if: (a) the Noteholder gives to the Trustee, the Control Party and the Controlling Class Representative written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (b) the Noteholders of at least 25 of the aggregate principal amount of all then Outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee, the Control Party and the Controlling Class Representative to pursue the remedy; (c) such Noteholder or Noteholders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee, the Control Party and the Controlling Class Representative indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee, the Control Party and the Controlling Class Representative against any loss, liability or expense; (d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within sixty (60) days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it; (e) during such sixty (60) day period, the Majority of Senior Noteholders do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request; and (f) the Control Party (at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) has consented to the pursuit of such remedy. A Noteholder may not use the Indenture or any other Transaction Document to prejudice the rights of another Noteholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Noteholder.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder of the Note. Section 9.11 The Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the 

111 reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel), the Noteholders and any other Secured Party (as applicable) allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Co-Issuers (or any other obligor upon the Notes), their creditors or their property, and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders or any other Secured Party, to pay the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 10.5. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 10.5 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money and other properties which any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder or any other Secured Party any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Noteholder or any other Secured Party, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder or any other Secured Party in any such proceeding. Section 9.12 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under the Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of any undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 9.12 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Noteholder pursuant to Section 9.9, the Control Party or a suit by Noteholders of more than 10 of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of all Series of Notes. Section 9.13 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee, any Noteholder or any other Secured Party has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under the Indenture or any other Transaction Document and such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Noteholder or other Secured Party, then and in every such case the Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee, the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been instituted. Section 9.14 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes or any other Secured Party is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right or remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given under the Indenture or any other Transaction Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy under the Indenture or any other Transaction Document, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. 

112 Section 9.15 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee, the Control Party, the Controlling Class Representative, any Holder of any Note or any other Secured Party to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Potential Rapid Amortization Event, Rapid Amortization Event, Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Potential Rapid Amortization Event, Rapid Amortization Event, Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article IX or by law to the Trustee, the Control Party, the Controlling Class Representative, the Holders of Notes or any other Secured Party may be exercised from time to time to the extent not inconsistent with the Indenture, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee, the Control Party, the Controlling Class Representative, the Holders of Notes or any other Secured Party, as the case may be. Section 9.16 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. Each Co-Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of the Indenture or any other Transaction Document; and each Co-Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantages of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, the Control Party or the Controlling Class Representative, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE X THE TRUSTEE Section 10.1 Duties of the Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default or a Rapid Amortization Event of which the Trustee shall have Actual Knowledge has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall (except in the case of the receipt of directions with respect to such matter from the Control Party in accordance with the terms of this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document in which event the Trustee s sole responsibility will be to act or refrain from acting in accordance with such directions) exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Base Indenture and the other Transaction Documents, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person s own affairs; provided that the Trustee will have no liability in connection with any action or inaction taken, or not taken, by it upon the deemed occurrence of an Event of Default, a Rapid Amortization Event, a Manager Termination Event or a Servicer Termination Event of which a Trust Officer has not received written notice; provided, further, that the Trustee will have no liability in connection with any action or inaction due to the acts or failure to act of the Control Party or the Controlling Class Representative in connection with any Event of Default, Rapid Amortization Event, Manager Termination Event or Servicer Termination Event, or for acting or refraining from acting due to any direction or lack of direction from the Control Party or the Controlling Class Representative. The preceding sentence shall not have the effect of insulating the Trustee from liability arising out of the Trustee s negligence, fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any provision of the Indenture, shall examine them to determine whether they conform to the requirements of the Indenture; provided that the Trustee shall not be responsible for the accuracy or content of any resolution, certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or other instrument furnished by any Co-Issuer under the Indenture. 

113 (b) Except during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or a Rapid Amortization Event of which the Trustee shall have Actual Knowledge: (i) the Trustee undertakes to perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the Indenture or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party and no others, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in the Indenture or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into the Indenture or any other Transaction Document against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of the Indenture and any other applicable Transaction Document; provided that, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision of the Indenture are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine such certificates or opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of the Indenture and shall promptly notify the party of any non-conformity. (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligence, fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct, except that: (i) this clause (c) does not limit the effect of clause (a) of this Section 10.1; (ii) the Trustee will not be liable in its individual capacity for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it is proven that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (iii) the Trustee will not be liable in its individual capacity with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Control Party or the requisite Noteholders in accordance with this Base Indenture relating to the time, method and place for conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Base Indenture or any other circumstances in which such direction is required or permitted by the terms of this Base Indenture; and (iv) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default, Event of Default, Potential Rapid Amortization Event, Rapid Amortization Event, Manager Termination Event, Potential Manager Termination Event or Servicer Termination Event or the commencement and continuation of a Cash Trapping Period until such time as the Trustee shall have Actual Knowledge or shall have received written notice thereof, and in the absence of such Actual Knowledge or receipt of such notice the Trustee may conclusively assume that no such event has occurred or is continuing. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture or any of the other Transaction Documents, no provision of the Indenture or the other Transaction Documents shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or exercise of its rights or powers hereunder or thereunder, if it has reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate security or indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by the terms of the Indenture or the Guarantee and Collateral Agreements. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any risk, loss, liability or expense. 

114 (e) In the event that the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall fail to perform any obligation, duty or agreement in the manner or on the day required to be performed by the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as the case may be, under the Indenture, the Trustee shall be obligated as soon as practicable upon Actual Knowledge thereof and receipt of appropriate records and information, if any, to perform such obligation, duty or agreement in the manner so required. (f) Subject to Section 10.3, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law or the Indenture or any of the other Transaction Documents. (g) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 10.1. (h) The Trustee shall not be responsible (i) for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral, (ii) for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to the extent such action or omission constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, (iii) for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or any agreement or assignment contained therein, (iv) for the validity of the title of the Securitization Entities to the Collateral, (v) for insuring the Collateral or (vi) for the payment of Taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the maintenance of the Collateral, except as otherwise provided by Section 10.1(e). Except as otherwise provided herein, the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of the Indenture or the other Transaction Documents by the Securitization Entities or Service Recipients. (i) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the Indenture at the direction of the Servicer, the Control Party, the Controlling Class Representative or the requisite percentage of Noteholders, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, under the Indenture. (j) The Trustee shall have no duty (i) to see to any recording, filing or depositing of this Base Indenture or any agreement referred to herein or any financing statement, financing change statement or continuation statement evidencing a security interest, or to see to the maintenance of any such recording, filing or depositing or to any rerecording, refiling or redeposition of any thereof; (ii) to see to any insurance; (iii) except as otherwise provided by Section 10.1(e), to see to the payment or discharge of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any lien or encumbrance of any kind; or (iv) to confirm or verify the contents of any reports or certificates of either or both Co-Issuers, either or both Managers, the Control Party, the Back-Up Manager or the Servicer delivered to the Trustee pursuant to this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document believed by the Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. (k) The Trustee shall not be personally liable for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of, in connection with or as a result of the performance of its duties under the Indenture. (l) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.1, the Trustee shall make Debt Service Advances to the extent and in the manner set forth in Section 5.12(c) hereof and Collateral Protection Advances to the extent the Servicer fails to make such Collateral Protection Advances; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary, the Trustee will not be responsible for advancing any principal on the 

115 Senior Notes, any make-whole prepayment consideration, any Class A-1 Notes Administrative Expenses, any Class A-1 Notes Commitment Fees, any Post-ARD Additional Interest or any reserve amounts or any interest or principal payable on, or any other amount due with respect to, the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Subordinated Notes; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will not be required to make any Debt Service Advance in respect of any Class A-1 Notes Interest Adjustment Amount to the extent such Debt Service Advance would be duplicative of a Debt Service Advance already made with respect to such Quarterly Calculation Date. (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the Trustee if the Trustee determines such Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance (including interest thereon) would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance or, on or after the 2021 Springing Amendments Implementation Date, if the Managers elect to eliminate the obligation of the Servicer and/or the Trustee to provide Advances upon satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition or an Advance Suspension Period is then in effect. The determination by the Trustee that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance, or that any proposed Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance, shall be made by the Trustee in its reasonable good faith judgment. The Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on the determination of the Servicer that an Advance is or would be a Nonrecoverable Advance. Any such determination will be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders. The Trustee may update or change its nonrecoverability determination at any time, and may decide that a requested Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance that was previously deemed to be a Nonrecoverable Advance shall have become recoverable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all outstanding Debt Service Advances and Collateral Protection Advances made by the Trustee and any accrued interest thereon will be paid strictly in accordance with the Priority of Payments, even if the Trustee determines that any such advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance after such Advance has been made. In no event shall the Trustee be required to make a Collateral Protection Advance, including a Requested Collateral Protection Advance, unless the Servicer has determined that such Collateral Protection Advance has been approved, the Servicer has subsequently failed to make such Collateral Protection Advance and the Trustee has not determined that such Collateral Protection Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. (iii) The Trustee shall be entitled to receive interest at the Advance Interest Rate accrued on the amount of each Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance made thereby (with its own funds) for so long as such Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance is outstanding. Such interest with respect to any Debt Service Advance or Collateral Protection Advance made pursuant to this Section 10.1(l) shall be payable out of Collections in accordance with the Priority of Payments pursuant to Section 5.11 hereof and the other applicable provisions of the Transaction Documents. Section 10.2 Rights of the Trustee. Except as otherwise provided by Section 10.1: (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting based upon any resolution, Officer s Certificate, Officers Certificate, certificate of a Manager, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, instrument, report, consent, order, document or other paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by or presented by the proper person.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes, suffers or omits to take in the absence of negligence, fraud, bad faith and willful misconduct which it believes to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by the Indenture or the other applicable Transaction Documents. (e) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Base Indenture, any Series Supplement or any other Transaction Document, or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or thereunder or in relation hereto or thereto, at the request, order or direction of the Servicer, the Control Party, the Controlling Class Representative, any of the Noteholders or any other Secured Party pursuant to the provisions of this Base Indenture, any Series Supplement or any other Transaction Document, unless the Trustee has been offered security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by it in compliance with such request, order or direction. (f) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default or Rapid Amortization Event, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts of matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless requested in writing so to do by the Noteholders of at least 25 of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of all then Outstanding Notes. If the Trustee is so requested or determines in its own discretion to make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it sees fit, the Trustee shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Service Recipients, personally or by agent or attorney, at the sole cost of the Co-Issuers, and the Trustee shall incur no liability by reason of such inquiry or investigation. (g) The right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this Base Indenture shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall be not be liable in the absence of negligence, fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct for the performance of such act.

The Trustee will ask for the name, address, tax identification number and other information that will allow the Trustee to identify the individual or entity who is establishing the relationship or opening the account. The Trustee may also ask for formation documents such as articles of incorporation, an offering memorandum, or other identifying documents to be provided. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any and all communications (both text and attachments) by or from the Trustee that the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to contain confidential, proprietary or sensitive information and sent by electronic mail will be encrypted. The recipient of the e-mail communication will be required to complete a one-time registration process.

(k) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the execution of the trust created hereby or the powers granted hereunder. (l) All rights of action and claims under this Base Indenture may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name or in its capacity as Trustee. Any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payments to the Trustee provided for in Section 10.5, be distributed in accordance with the Priority of Payments. (m) The Trustee may request written direction from any applicable party any time the Indenture provides that the Trustee may be directed to act. (n) Any request or direction of any Co-Issuer mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Order. (o) Whenever in the administration of the Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee may, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, rely upon an Officer s Certificate or Officers Certificate of each applicable Co-Issuer, any applicable Manager or the Servicer and shall incur no liability for its reliance thereon. (p) The Trustee shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the books or records of, or for any acts or omissions of, DTC, any transfer agent (other than the Trustee itself acting in that capacity), Clearstream, Euroclear, any calculation agent (other than the Trustee itself acting in that capacity), or any agent appointed by it with due care or any Paying Agent (other than the Trustee itself acting in that capacity).

The Trustee does not guarantee the performance of any Eligible Investments. (r) The Trustee shall have no obligation to invest and reinvest any cash held in the absence of timely and specific written investment direction as specified herein. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Trustee shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any investment prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the Servicer or the Co-Issuers to provide timely written investment direction. (s) The Trustee shall have no obligation to calculate nor shall it be responsible or liable for any calculation of the DSCR, the Interest-Only DSCR, the New Series Pro Forma DSCR or the Cash Trapping DSCR Threshold. 

118 (t) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee, in each case, with respect to its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder. (u) The Trustee shall be afforded, in each Transaction Document, all of the rights, powers, immunities and indemnities granted to it in this Base Indenture as if such rights, powers, immunities and indemnities were specifically set out in each such Transaction Document. (v) For any purpose under the Transaction Documents, the Trustee may conclusively assume without incurring liability therefor that no Notes are held by any of the Securitization Entities, any other obligor upon the Notes, any Manager or any Affiliate of any of them unless a Trust Officer has received written notice at the Corporate Trust Office that any Notes are so held by any of the Securitization Entities, any other obligor upon the Notes, any Manager or any Affiliate of any of them. (w) The Trustee shall not have any responsibility to make any inquiry or investigation as to, and shall have no obligation in respect of, the terms of an engagement of an Independent Auditor by any Co-Issuer (or any respective Manager on behalf of a Co-Issuer) or the terms of any agreed upon procedures in respect of such engagement; provided that the Trustee shall be authorized, upon receipt of a Company Order directing the same, to execute any acknowledgment or other agreement with the Independent Auditors required for the Trustee to receive any of the reports or instructions provided herein, which acknowledgment or agreement may include, among other things, (i) acknowledgment that each Co- Issuer has agreed that the procedures to be performed by the Independent Auditors are sufficient for such Co-Issuer s purposes, (ii) releases by the Trustee (on behalf of itself and the Holders) of claims against the Independent Auditors, and (iii) restrictions or prohibitions on the disclosure of information or documents provided to it by such firm of Independent Auditors (including to the Holders).

Section 10.3 Individual Rights of the Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Securitization Entities or any Affiliate of the Securitization Entities with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. Section 10.4 Notice of Events of Default and Defaults. If an Event of Default, a Default, a Rapid Amortization Event or a Potential Rapid Amortization Event occurs and is continuing and if the Trustee has Actual Knowledge thereof, or written notice of the existence thereof has been delivered to the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office, the Trustee shall promptly provide the Noteholders, the Servicer, the Managers, the Back-Up Manager, each Co-Issuer, any Class A-1 Administrative Agent and each Rating Agency with notice of such Event of Default, Default, Rapid Amortization Event or Potential Rapid Amortization Event, to the extent that the Notes of such Series are Book-Entry Notes by telephone and facsimile and otherwise by first class mail. Section 10.5 Compensation and Indemnity. (a) The Co-Issuers shall, jointly and severally, promptly pay to the Trustee from time to time compensation for its acceptance of the Indenture and services hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents to which the Trustee is a party as the Trustee and the Co-Issuers shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Co-Issuers shall, jointly and severally, reimburse the Trustee promptly upon 

119 request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the Priority of Payments). Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee s agents and outside counsel. The Co-Issuers shall not be required to reimburse any expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee s own willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default or Rapid Amortization Event occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are post-filing expenses and intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. (b) The Co-Issuers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any loss, liability, claim, expense (including taxes, other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee or such predecessor Trustee), damage or injury suffered or sustained by reason of any acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions arising out of or in connection with (i) the activities of the Trustee or such predecessor Trustee pursuant to this Base Indenture, any Series Supplement or any other Transaction Documents to which the Trustee is a party and (ii) the security interest granted hereby, whether arising by virtue of any act or omission on the part of a Co-Issuer or otherwise, including but not limited to any judgment, award, settlement, reasonable attorneys fees and other costs or expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding, claim (whether asserted by either Co-Issuer, the Servicer, the Control Party or any Noteholder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder or under any other Transaction Document, the preservation of any of its rights to, or the realization upon, any of the Collateral, or in connection with enforcing the provisions of this Section 10.5(b); provided, however, that the Co-Issuers shall not indemnify the Trustee, any predecessor Trustee or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents if such acts, omissions or alleged acts or omissions constitute willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence by the Trustee or such predecessor Trustee, as the case may be. (c) The provisions of this Section 10.5 shall survive the termination of the Indenture and the resignation and removal of the Trustee. Section 10.6 Replacement of the Trustee. (a) A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee will become effective only upon the successor Trustee s acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 10.6. (b) The Trustee may, after giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Co- Issuers, the Noteholders, the Servicer, the Managers, the Back-Up Manager, the Controlling Class Representative, the Class A-1 Administrative Agent and each Rating Agency, resign at any time from its office and be discharged from the trust hereby created; provided that no such resignation of the Trustee will be effective until a successor Trustee has assumed the obligations of the Trustee hereunder. The Control Party or the Co-Issuers may remove the Trustee, or any Noteholder may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee, if at any time: (i) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 10.8; (ii) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under the Bankruptcy Code; 

120 (iii) the Trustee fails generally to pay its debts as such debts become due; or (iv) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of the Trustee for any reason, the Co-Issuers shall promptly, with the prior written consent of the Control Party, appoint a successor Trustee.

144 Section 14.7 Payment on Business Day. In any case where any Quarterly Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date of any Note shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any), as the case may be, need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Quarterly Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date; provided, however, that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Quarterly Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date, as the case may be. Section 14.8 Governing Law. THIS BASE INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES (OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5- 1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK).

In the event that any such Noteholder or other Secured Party or the Trustee takes action in violation of this Section 14.13, each affected Securitization Entity shall file or cause to be filed an

Section 14.17 Calculation of Driven Brands Leverage Ratio and Senior Leverage Ratio. (a) Driven Brands Leverage Ratio. 

146 (i) In the event that the Parent or any of the Parent Consolidated Subsidiaries incurs, repays, repurchases or redeems any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio is being calculated, then the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods (including in the case of any incurrence or issuance, a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom); provided that the Managers may elect pursuant to an Officers Certificate delivered to each of the Trustee and the Control Party (with respect to which the Trustee and the Control Party shall have no obligation of any nature whatsoever) to treat all or any portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness (including all or a portion of the commitments under any acquisition debt financing commitment arrangement (including customary bridge-to-bond or bridge-to- securitization commitments) with respect to Indebtedness not yet incurred, and the term incur and derivations thereof shall include the obtaining of any such commitment for such financing and any replacement or refinancing thereof for all purposes of this Section 14.17(a) and the Transaction Documents) as being incurred at such time, in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence at such subsequent time. (ii) For purposes of making the computation of the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio (including, without limitation, the calculation of Parent Adjusted EBITDA used therein), investments, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisitions, dispositions, refranchising transactions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, and any operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, restructurings or reorganizations that any of the Parent or any of the Parent Consolidated Subsidiaries has either determined to make or made during the preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods or subsequent to such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods and on or prior to or simultaneously with or subsequent to the event for which the calculation of the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio is made (each, for purposes of the calculations described in this Section 14.17, a pro forma event shall, at the discretion of the Managers, be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such investments, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisitions, dispositions, refranchising transactions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations, operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, restructurings and reorganizations (and the change in Parent Adjusted EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Parent or a Parent Consolidated Subsidiary since the beginning of such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods shall have made any investment, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisition, disposition, refranchising transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, restructuring or reorganization, in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.17, then the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio shall, at the discretion of the Managers, be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such investment, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisition, disposition, refranchising transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods. (b) Senior Leverage Ratio. 

147 (i) In the event that the Securitization Entities incur, repay, repurchase or redeem any Senior Notes subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Senior Leverage Ratio is being calculated, then the Senior Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Senior Notes, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods (including in the case of any incurrence or issuance, a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom); provided that the Managers may elect pursuant to an Officers Certificate delivered to each of the Trustee and the Control Party (with respect to which the Trustee and the Control Party shall have no obligation of any nature whatsoever) to treat all or any portion of the commitment under any Senior Notes (including all or a portion of the commitments under any acquisition debt financing commitment arrangement (including customary bridge- to-bond or bridge-to-securitization commitments) with respect to Senior Notes not yet incurred, and the term incur and derivations thereof shall include the obtaining of any such commitment for such financing and any replacement or refinancing thereof for purposes of this Section 14.17(b) and the Transaction Documents) as being incurred at such time, in which case any subsequent incurrence of Senior Notes under such commitment shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an incurrence at such subsequent time. (ii) For purposes of making the computation of the Senior Leverage Ratio (including, without limitation, the calculation of Net Cash Flow used therein), any pro forma event shall, at the discretion of the Managers, be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such investments, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisitions, dispositions, refranchising transactions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations, operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, restructurings and reorganizations (and the change in Net Cash Flow resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Securitization Entity since the beginning of such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods shall have made any investment, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisition, disposition, refranchising transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, restructuring or reorganization, in each case with respect to an operating unit of a business, that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.17, then the Senior Leverage Ratio shall, at the discretion of the Managers, be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such investment, payments of debt, dividends, distributions or similar payments, acquisition, disposition, refranchising transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, business realignment project or initiative, restructuring or reorganization had occurred at the beginning of the applicable preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods. (c) Calculations to be Made in Good Faith. For purposes of the calculations described in this Section 14.17, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any pro forma event, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Managers. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Managers as set forth in an Officers Certificate delivered to each of the Trustee and the Control Party (with respect to which the Trustee and the Control Party shall have no obligation of any nature whatsoever) to reflect (1) excess owner compensation, reasonably estimated or actual cost savings, operating improvements, synergies, integration costs and expenses and other pro forma adjustments, in each case reasonably expected to result from the applicable pro forma event, and (2) all adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of Parent Adjusted EBITDA and/or Net Cash Flow , as applicable, as set forth in the definition thereof, to the extent such adjustments, without duplication, continue to be applicable to such preceding four Quarterly Fiscal Periods. When calculating the Driven 

148 Brands Leverage Ratio or the Senior Leverage Ratio described in this Section 14.17 in connection with any commitment in respect of any Indebtedness relating to an acquisition, the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio or the Senior Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the discretion of the Managers, be calculated on a pro forma basis giving effect to such acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including such incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) as if they occurred at the beginning of the period of four (4) consecutive Quarterly Fiscal Periods most recently ended as of such date of determination; provided that (x) the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio or the Senior Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall not be tested again at the time of the consummation of such acquisition or related transactions and (y) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered into for purposes of subsequently calculating the Driven Brands Leverage Ratio or the Senior Leverage Ratio, as applicable, after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such acquisition. Section 14.18 Permitted Asset Dispositions and Permitted Brand Dispositions; Release of Collateral. After consummation of any Permitted Asset Disposition or any Permitted Brand Disposition, all Liens with respect to such property created in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties under this Base Indenture and the other Transaction Documents shall be automatically released, and, upon written request of the Co-Issuers, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Control Party, shall execute and deliver to the Securitization Entities any and all documentation reasonably requested and prepared by the Securitization Entities at their expense to effect or evidence the release by the Trustee of the Secured Parties security interest in the property disposed of in connection with such Permitted Asset Disposition or Permitted Brand Disposition. Section 14.19 FX Agent. Citibank, N.A. is hereby initially appointed as the FX Agent. No resignation or removal of the FX Agent and no appointment of a successor FX Agent will be effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor FX Agent. The FX Agent may resign at any time by giving not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Co-Issuers, the Servicer, the Managers, the Back-Up Manager, the Controlling Class Representative, the Class A-1 Administrative Agent and each Rating Agency. The Co-Issuers may remove the FX Agent at any time by giving not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Servicer, the Managers, the Back-Up Manager, the Controlling Class Representative, the Class A-1 Administrative Agent and each Rating Agency. Upon receiving any notice of resignation or providing any notice of removal, the Co-Issuers, with the consent of the Control Party (acting at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative), will promptly appoint a successor FX Agent pursuant to the procedures described in the Base Indenture and the Trustee and the Co-Issuers, and the Control Party (acting at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative) to the extent applicable, will endeavor to enter into any requisite amendments to the Base Indenture and, if any, the other Transaction Documents to account for Citibank, N.A. no longer being appointed as both Trustee and FX Agent. Section 14.20 Amendment and Restatement. The execution and delivery of this Base Indenture on the Series 2018-1 Closing Date shall constitute an amendment, replacement and restatement, but not a novation, of the obligations and liabilities under the Original Base Indenture. All Liens, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments and security interests securing the Original Base Indenture and the obligations relating thereto are hereby ratified, confirmed, renewed, extended, brought forward and rearranged as security for the Obligations, shall continue without any diminution thereof and shall remain in full force and effect on and after the Series 2018-1 Closing Date. As of the Series 2018-1 Closing Date, the Issuer hereby reaffirms all financing statements and amendments 

149 thereof filed and all other filings and recordations made in respect of the Collateral and the Liens and security interests granted under the Original Base Indenture and this Base Indenture and acknowledge that all such filings and recordations were and remain authorized and effective. Section 14.21 Currency Indemnity. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment against the Canadian Co-Issuer in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to this Base Indenture or any other Transaction Document, it becomes necessary to convert into a particular currency (the Judgment Currency any amount due under this Base Indenture or under any other Transaction Document in any currency other than the Judgment Currency (the Currency Due ), then conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day before the day on which judgment is given. For this purpose rate of exchange means the Spot Rate. In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given and the date of receipt by the Trustee of the amount due, the Canadian Co-Issuer shall, on the date of receipt by the Trustee, pay such additional amounts, if any, or be entitled to receive reimbursement of such amount, if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the amount received by the Trustee on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of receipt by the Trustee is the amount then due under this Agreement or such other Transaction Document in the Currency Due. If the amount of the Currency Due which the Trustee is so able to purchase is less than the amount of the Currency Due originally due to it, the Co-Issuers shall jointly and severally indemnify and save the Trustee and the Noteholders harmless from and against all loss or damage arising as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or under any judgment or order. Section 14.22 Hypothecary Representative The Trustee is hereby appointed and accepts its appointment as the hypothecary representative (fond de pouvoir) of all present and future Secured Parties as contemplated by article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec to enter into, to take and to hold, on behalf of and for the benefit of each of the Secured Parties, any hypothec granted on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec and to exercise such powers and duties which are conferred upon the Trustee under any deed of hypothec or herein or under any other agreement. Any Person who becomes a Secured Party will be deemed to have consented to and confirmed the Trustee as hypothecary representative and to have ratified as of the date such Person becomes a Secured Party all actions taken by the hypothecary representative. For greater certainty, the purchase of any Note by any Noteholder shall constitute ratification by such Noteholder of the appointment of the Trustee constituted hereunder and the incurrence of any debt by the Securitization Entities with the other Secured Parties pursuant to the applicable Transaction Document shall constitute such ratification by such Secured Party of such appointment constituted hereunder. The execution by the Trustee, acting as hypothecary representative, prior to the execution of this Base Indenture of any deeds of hypothec, pledges or other similar documents is hereby ratified and confirmed. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of An Act respecting the special powers of legal persons (Quebec), the Trustee may acquire and be the holder of any bond, note or other title of indebtedness issued by the Co-Issuers. The Trustee, acting as hypothecary representative for the Secured Parties, shall have the same rights, powers, immunities, indemnities and exclusions from liability as are prescribed in favor of Trustee in this Base Indenture, which shall apply mutatis mutandis. Without limitation, the provisions of the Base Indenture regarding the resignation or removal of the Trustee shall apply mutatis mutandis to the resignation or removal and appointment of a successor to the Trustee acting as hypothecary representative for the Secured Parties. 

150 Section 14.23 Electronic Signatures and Transmission For purposes of this Base Indenture, any Series Supplement and any Supplement thereto, any reference to written or in writing means any form of written communication, including, without limitation, electronic signatures, and any such written communication may be transmitted by Electronic Transmission.

The Advances made as part of the initial Borrowing, if any, will be evidenced by the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Advance Notes issued in connection herewith and will constitute purchases of Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Initial Advance Principal Amounts corresponding to the amount of such Advances. All of the other Advances will constitute Increases evidenced by the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Advance Notes issued in connection herewith and will constitute purchases of Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Outstanding Principal Amounts corresponding to the amount of such Advances. (d) Section 2.2(b) of the Series 2022-1 Supplement specifies the procedures to be followed in connection with any Voluntary Decrease of the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Outstanding Principal Amount. Each such Voluntary Decrease in respect of any Advances shall be either (i) in an aggregate minimum principal amount of 200,000 and integral multiples of 100,000 in excess thereof or (ii) in such other amount necessary to reduce the outstanding Advances to zero.

(f) At any time that the aggregate Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Outstanding Principal Amount attributable to each Investor Group is not held pro rata based on its respective Commitment Percentage, the Investor Groups (and the Investors within each such Investor Group) may, in their sole discretion, agree amongst themselves to reallocate any outstanding Advances to ensure that the aggregate Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Outstanding Principal Amount attributable to each Investor Group is pro rata based on its respective Commitment Percentage; provided that the Co-Issuers shall not be liable for any Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Breakage Amounts resulting solely from any such reallocations. (g) The Administrative Agent shall provide the Co-Issuers, the Managers and the Trustee timely notice of non-ratable allocations pursuant to Section 2.02(a) and of any reallocations of Advances pursuant to Section 2.02(f) (which notice requirements may be satisfied through the delivery of the monthly invoice delivered by the Administrative Agent from time to time); provided, that the failure to provide such notice shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Co-Issuers under this Agreement or the Indenture with respect thereto. The Co-Issuers and the Managers shall not be responsible for any failure to reflect such allocations or reallocations in any Weekly Manager s Certificate or Quarterly Noteholders Report, or for any payments inconsistent with such allocations or reallocations, until such notice is provided as set forth in this clause (g), including in connection with any Mandatory Decrease, Voluntary Decrease or prepayment of any other tranche, Class or Series of Notes under the Indenture.

5 p.m. (New York City time) two Business Days (or, in the case of any SOFR Advances for purposes of Section 3.01(b), two (2) U.S. Government Securities Business Days) prior to the date of such Borrowing (unless a shorter period is agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agents), which date of Borrowing shall be a Business Day during the Commitment Term. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the Co-Issuer making such Borrowing, (ii) the Borrowing date, (iii) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing to be made on such date, and (iv) sufficient instructions for application of the balance, if any, of the proceeds of such Borrowing on the Borrowing date (which proceeds shall be made available to the Co-Issuer making such Borrowing). Requests for any (x) Base Rate Advance may not be made in an aggregate principal amount of less than 250,000 or in an aggregate principal amount that is not an integral multiple of 50,000 in excess thereof (or in each case such other amount as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and (y) SOFR Advance may not be made in an aggregate principal amount of less than 500,000 or in an aggregate principal amount that is not an integral multiple of 50,000 in excess thereof (or in each case such other amount as agreed to by the Administrative Agent). Subject to the provisos to Section 2.02(a), each Borrowing shall be ratably allocated among the Investor Groups respective Maximum Investor Group Principal Amounts. Each Funding Agent shall promptly advise its related Conduit Investor, if any, of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) and shall promptly thereafter (but in no event later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of Borrowing) notify the Administrative Agent, the Co-Issuers and the related Committed Note Purchaser(s) whether such Conduit Investor has determined to make all or any portion of the Advances in such Borrowing that are to be made by its Investor Group. On the date of each Borrowing and subject to the other conditions set forth herein and in the Series 2022-1 Supplement, the applicable Investors in each Investor Group shall make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of the Advances in such Borrowing that are to be made by such Investor Group by wire transfer in U.S. Dollars of such amount in same day funds no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (or such later time as the Administrative Agent may agree to in its sole discretion on the date of any Borrowing) on the date of such Borrowing, and upon receipt thereof the Administrative Agent shall make such proceeds available by 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) to the Co-Issuer making such Borrowing, as instructed in the applicable Advance Request. (b) (i) The failure of any Committed Note Purchaser to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Committed Note Purchaser (whether or not in the same Investor Group) of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Committed Note Purchaser shall be responsible for the failure of any other Committed Note Purchaser to make the Advance to be made by such other Committed Note Purchaser on the date of any Borrowing and (ii) in the event that one or more Committed Note Purchasers fails to make its Advance by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (or such later time as the Administrative Agent may agree to in its sole discretion on the date of any Borrowing) on the date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the other Committed Note Purchasers not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such date, and each of the other Committed Note Purchasers may (but shall not be obligated to) make available to the Administrative Agent a supplemental Advance in a principal amount (such amount, the reference amount equal to the lesser of (a) the aggregate principal Advance that was unfunded multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Commitment Amount of such Committed Note Purchaser and the denominator of which is the aggregate Commitment Amounts of all Committed Note Purchasers (less the aggregate Commitment Amount of the Committed Note Purchasers failing to make Advances on such date) and (b) the excess of (i) such Committed Note Purchaser s Commitment Amount over (ii) the product of such Committed Note Purchaser s related Investor Group Principal Amount multiplied by such Committed Note Purchaser s Committed Note Purchaser Percentage (after giving effect to all prior Advances on such date of Borrowing) (provided that a Committed Note Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to), on terms and conditions to be agreed upon by such Committed Note Purchaser and the applicable Co-Issuer, make available to the Administrative Agent a supplemental Advance in a principal amount in excess of the reference amount; provided, however, that no such supplemental Advance shall be permitted to be made to the extent that, after giving effect to such Advance, the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Outstanding Principal Amount would exceed the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Notes Maximum Principal Amount). Such supplemental Advances shall be made by wire transfer in U.S. Dollars in same day funds no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) one (1) Business Day following the date of such Borrowing, and upon receipt thereof the 

6 Administrative Agent shall immediately make such proceeds available to the Co-Issuer making such Borrowing, as instructed in the applicable Advance Request. If any Committed Note Purchaser which shall have so failed to fund its Advance shall subsequently pay such amount, the Administrative Agent shall apply such amount pro rata to repay any supplemental Advances made by the other Committed Note Purchasers pursuant to this Section 2.03(b). (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Funding Agent prior to the date of any Borrowing that an applicable Investor in the related Investor Group will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Investor s share of the Advances to be made by such Investor Group as part of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Investor has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Co-Issuer on such date a corresponding amount, and shall, if such corresponding amount has not been made available by the Administrative Agent, make available to the applicable Co-Issuer on such date a corresponding amount once such Investor has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent. If and to the extent that any Investor shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Investor and the Co-Issuers jointly and severally agree to repay (without duplication) to the Administrative Agent on the next Weekly Allocation Date such corresponding amount (in the case of the Co-Issuers, in accordance with the Priority of Payments), together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the applicable Co-Issuer until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Co-Issuers, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Investor, the Federal Funds Rate and without deduction by such Investor for any withholding taxes.

On each date an Advance is made hereunder, and on each date the outstanding amount thereof is reduced, a duly authorized officer, employee or agent of the related Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Noteholder shall make appropriate notations in its books and records of the amount, evidenced by the related Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Advance Note, of such Advance and the amount of such reduction, as applicable. The Co-Issuers hereby authorize each duly authorized officer, employee and agent of such Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Noteholder to make such notations on the books and records as aforesaid and every such notation made in accordance with the foregoing authority shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded; provided, however, that in the event of a discrepancy between the books and records of such Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Noteholder and the records maintained by the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, such discrepancy shall be resolved by such Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Noteholder, the Control Party and the Trustee, in consultation with the Co-Issuers (provided that such consultation with the Co-Issuers will not in any way limit or delay such Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Noteholder s, the Control Party s and the Trustee s ability to resolve such discrepancy), and such resolution shall control in the absence of manifest error; provided, further, that the failure of any such notation to be made, or any finding that a notation is incorrect, in any such records shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Co-Issuers under this Agreement or the Indenture.

16 consultation with the Co-Issuers, decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of any such rate or to permit the use and administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent decides in its reasonable discretion that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines in its reasonable discretion and in consultation with the Co-Issuers that no market practice for the administration of any such rate exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents). Daily Simple SOFR means, for any day, SOFR, with the conventions for this rate (which may include a lookback) being established by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the conventions for this rate selected or recommended by the Relevant Governmental Body for determining Daily Simple SOFR for syndicated business loans at such times; provided that if the Administrative Agent decides that any such convention is not administratively feasible for the Investor Groups, then the Administrative Agent may establish another convention in its reasonable discretion.

19 Issuer or dealing at arm s length with a specified shareholder of the Canadian Co-Issuer, or (z) such Affected Person or beneficial owner being a specified entity in respect of the Canadian Co-Issuer, as applicable, arises solely as a result of such Affected Person or beneficial owner having become a party to, received or perfected a security interest under or received or enforced any rights under, any Transaction Document) (such Class A-1 Taxes not excluded by clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above being called Non-Excluded Taxes ). If any Class A-1 Taxes are imposed and required by law to be withheld or deducted from any amount payable by the Co-Issuers hereunder to an Affected Person, then (x) if such Class A-1 Taxes are Non-Excluded Taxes, the amount of the payment shall be increased so that such payment is made, after withholding or deduction for or on account of such Non-Excluded Taxes, in an amount that is not less than the amount equal to the sum that would have been received by the Affected Person had no such deduction or withholding been required and (y) the Co-Issuers shall withhold the amount of such Class A-1 Taxes from such payment (as increased, if applicable, pursuant to the preceding clause (x)) and shall pay such amount, subject to and in accordance with the Priority of Payments, to the taxing authority imposing such Class A-1 Taxes in accordance with applicable law. (b) Moreover, if any Non-Excluded Taxes are directly asserted against any Affected Person or its agent with respect to any payment received by such Affected Person or its agent from the Co-Issuers or otherwise in respect of any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated therein, such Affected Person or its agent may pay such Non-Excluded Taxes and the Co-Issuers will, within five (5) Business Days of the Co-Issuers receipt of written notice stating the amount of such Non- Excluded Taxes (including the calculation thereof in reasonable detail), deposit into the applicable Collection Account, to be distributed as Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Notes Other Amounts, subject to and in accordance with the Priority of Payments, to the Administrative Agent and by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Funding Agent, and such Funding Agent shall pay to such Affected Person, such additional amounts (collectively, Increased Tax Costs, which term shall include all amounts payable by or on behalf of the Co-Issuers pursuant to this Section 3.08) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by such Affected Person or agent after the payment of such Non-Excluded Taxes (including any Non-Excluded Taxes on such Increased Tax Costs) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had no such Non-Excluded Taxes been asserted. Any amount payable to an Affected Person under this Section 3.08 shall be reduced by, and Increased Tax Costs shall not include, the amount of incremental damages (including Class A-1 Taxes) due or payable by the Co-Issuers as a direct result of such Affected Person s failure to demand from the Co-Issuers additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.08 within 180 days from the date on which the related Non-Excluded Taxes were incurred. (c) As promptly as practicable after the payment of any Class A-1 Taxes, and in any event within thirty (30) days of any such payment being due, the Co-Issuers shall furnish to each applicable Affected Person or its agents a certified copy of an official receipt (or other documentary evidence satisfactory to such Affected Person and agents) evidencing the payment of such Class A-1 Taxes. If the Co-Issuers fail to pay any Class A-1 Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fail to remit to the Affected Persons or their agents the required receipts (or such other documentary evidence), the Co-Issuers shall indemnify (by depositing such amounts into the applicable Collection Account, to be distributed subject to and in accordance with the Priority of Payments) each Affected Person and its agents for any Non-Excluded Taxes that may become payable by any such Affected Person or its agents as a result of any such failure. (d) Each Affected Person on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter as soon as practicable after the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form or document previously delivered) or within a reasonable period of time following a written request by the Administrative Agent or the Co-Issuers, shall deliver to the Co-Issuers and the Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8IMY or Form W-9, as applicable, or applicable successor form, or such other forms or documents (or successor forms or documents), appropriately completed and executed, as may be applicable and as will permit the Co-Issuers or the Administrative Agent, in their reasonable determination, to establish the extent to which a payment to such Affected Person is exempt from or eligible for a reduced rate of 

20 withholding or deduction of United States federal withholding taxes and to determine whether or not such Affected Person is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Promptly following the receipt of a written request by the Co-Issuers or the Administrative Agent, each Affected Person shall deliver to the Co-Issuers and the Administrative Agent any other forms or documents (or successor forms or documents) appropriately completed and executed, as may be applicable to establish the extent to which a payment to such Affected Person is exempt from withholding or deduction of Non- Excluded Taxes other than United States federal withholding taxes, including but not limited to, such information necessary to claim the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code. The Co-Issuers shall not be required to pay any increased amount under Section 3.08(a) or Section 3.08(b) to an Affected Person in respect of the withholding or deduction of United States federal withholding taxes or other Non-Excluded Taxes imposed as the result of the failure or inability (other than as a result of a Change in Law) of such Affected Person to comply with the requirements set forth in this Section 3.08(d). The Co-Issuers may rely on any form or document provided pursuant to this Section 3.08(d) until notified otherwise by the Affected Person that delivered such form or document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Affected Person shall be required to deliver any documentation that it is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of a change in applicable law after the time the Affected Person becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new lending office). (e) If a payment made to an Affected Person pursuant to this Agreement would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Affected Person were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Affected Person shall deliver to the Co-Issuers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Co-Issuers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Co-Issuers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Co-Issuers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Affected Person has complied with such Affected Person s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (e), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
