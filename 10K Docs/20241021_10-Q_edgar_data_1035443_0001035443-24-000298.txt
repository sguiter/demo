 billion and an asset base in North America that includes million RSF of operating properties , million RSF of Class A/A+ 
 properties undergoing construction, and one committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the next two years . As 
 used in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, references to the Company, Alexandria, ARE, we, us, and our refer to Alexandria 
 Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the 
 accounts of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and 
 transactions have been eliminated. 
 We have prepared the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and in conformity 
 with the rules and regulations of the SEC. In our opinion, these interim consolidated financial statements presented herein reflect all 
 adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary to fairly present the interim consolidated financial statements. The results 
 of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 
 2024 . These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial 
 statements and the notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Any references to 
 our total market capitalization, number or quality of buildings or tenants, quality of location, square footage, number of leases, or 
 occupancy percentage, and any amounts derived from these values in these notes to consolidated financial statements are outside the 
 scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s procedures.

years . Land improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful 
 lives, not to exceed years . Tenant improvements are depreciated over their respective lease terms or estimated useful lives, and 
 equipment is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life. The values of the right-of-use assets are 
 amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining terms of each related lease. The values of acquired in-place leases and 
 associated favorable intangibles (i.e., acquired above-market leases) are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
 and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases as a reduction of income from rentals in our consolidated statements 
 of operations. The values of unfavorable intangibles (i.e., acquired below-market leases) associated with acquired in-place leases are 
 classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the 
 remaining terms of the related leases as an increase in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Capitalized project costs 
 We capitalize project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly 
 related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, 
 redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. 
 Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total 
 expenses and net income. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as 
 incurred. Should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and 
 certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and 
 maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
 Real estate sales 
 A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, 
 having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its 
 present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions 
 required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within 
 ; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and 
 (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the 
 plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Refer to Note 15 Assets 
 classified as held for sale to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 If the disposal of a property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial 
 results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts 
 of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued 
 operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing 
 operations to discontinued operations. The disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore 
 will typically not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. 
 We recognize gains or losses on real estate sales in accordance with the accounting standard on the derecognition of 
 nonfinancial assets arising from contracts with noncustomers. Our ordinary output activities consist of the leasing of space to our 
 tenants in our operating properties, not the sales of real estate. Therefore, sales of real estate (in which we are the seller) qualify as 
 contracts with noncustomers. In our transactions with noncustomers, we apply certain recognition and measurement principles 
 consistent with our method of recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers. Derecognition of the asset is based on the 
 transfer of control. If a real estate sales contract includes our ongoing involvement with the property, then we evaluate each promised 
 good or service under the contract to determine whether it represents a separate performance obligation, constitutes a guarantee, or 
 prevents the transfer of control. If a good or service is considered a separate performance obligation, an allocated portion of the 
 transaction price is recognized as revenue as we transfer the related good or service to the buyer. 
 The recognition of gain or loss on the sale of a partial interest also depends on whether we retain a controlling or 
 noncontrolling interest in the property. If we retain a controlling interest in the property upon completion of the sale, we continue to 
 reflect the asset at its book value, record a noncontrolling interest for the book value of the partial interest sold, and recognize additional 
 paid-in capital for the difference between the consideration received and the partial interest at book value. Conversely, if we retain a 
 noncontrolling interest upon completion of the sale of a partial interest of real estate, we recognize a gain or loss as if 100 of the asset 
 were sold.

properties in Canada . The functional currency for our subsidiaries 
 operating in the U.S. is the U.S. dollar. The local currency of a foreign subsidiary serves as its functional currency. The assets and 
 liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. 
 Revenue and expense accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the weighted-average exchange rate for the periods 
 presented. Gains or losses resulting from the translation are classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a 
 separate component of total equity and are excluded from net income (loss). 
 Whenever a foreign investment meets the criteria for classification as held for sale, we evaluate the recoverability of the 
 investment under the held for sale impairment model. We may recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the investment 
 exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. In determining an investment s carrying amount, we consider its net book value and any 
 cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment related to the investment. 
 The appropriate amounts of foreign exchange rate gains or losses classified in accumulated other comprehensive income 
 (loss) are reclassified to net income (loss) when realized upon the sale of our investment or upon the complete or substantially 
 complete liquidation of our investment. 

. We evaluate each investment to 
 determine whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. We evaluate investments in 
 which our ownership is equal to or greater than 20 , but less than or equal to 50 , of an investee s voting stock with a presumption 
 that we have this ability. For our investments in limited partnerships that maintain specific ownership accounts, we presume that such 
 ability exists when our ownership interest exceeds 3 to 5 . In addition to our ownership interest, we consider whether we have a 
 board seat or whether we participate in the investee s policy-making process, among other criteria, to determine if we have the ability to 
 exert significant influence, but not control, over an investee. If we determine that we have such ability, we account for the investment 
 under the equity method, as described below. 
 From time to time, we may hold equity investments that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. We do not recognize a 
 discount related to a contractual sale restriction.

 interest rate method. At lease commencement, we record an asset within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, which 
 represents our net investment in the lease. This initial net investment is determined by aggregating the present values of the total future 
 lease payments attributable to the lease and the estimated residual value of the property, less any unearned income related to our 
 direct financing lease. Over the lease term, the investment in the lease accretes in value, producing a constant periodic rate of return on 
 the net investment in the lease. Income from these leases is classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of 
 operations. Our net investment is reduced over time as lease payments are received. We evaluate our net investment in direct financing 
 and sales-type leases for impairment under the current expected credit loss accounting standard. For more information, refer to 
 Allowance for credit losses in Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited consolidated financial 
 statements. 
 As a lessor, we classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate as an operating lease

million and 
 million , respectively, primarily related to short-term parking revenues associated with long-term lease agreements. Short-term 
 parking revenues do not qualify for the single component accounting policy, as discussed in Lessor accounting in Note 2 Summary 
 of significant accounting policies , due to the difference in the timing and pattern of transfer of our parking service obligations and 
 associated lease components within the same lease agreement. We recognize short-term parking revenues in accordance with the 
 revenue recognition accounting standard when the service is provided and the performance obligation is satisfied, which normally 
 occurs at a point in time.

 Based upon our evaluation of each acquisition, we determined that substantially all of the fair value related to each acquisition 
 was concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets or was associated with a land parcel with no 
 operations. Accordingly, each transaction did not meet the definition of a business and therefore was accounted for as an asset 
 acquisition. In each of these transactions, we allocated the total consideration for each acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities 
 acquired on a relative fair value basis .

 agreements for these potential acquisitions with the total p urchase price aggregating million in 2020 and 2022 , and we 
 initially expected to close these acquisitions after 2024. Our intent for each site included the demolition of existing buildings 
 upon expiration of the existing in-place leases and the development of life science properties. During the three months ended

 In 2006, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC, a subsidiary of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., was granted an option to 
 incorporate a land parcel adjacent to and north of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City ACLS-NYC campus 
 Option Parcel into the existing ground lease of that campus. The Option Parcel will allow ARE-East River Science Park, LLC to 
 develop a future world-class life science building within the ACLS-NYC campus. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC s investment in pre- 
 construction costs related to the development of the Option Parcel, including costs related to design, engineering, environmental, 
 survey/title, and permitting and legal costs, aggregate million as of September 30, 2024 . 
 On August 6, 2024, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern 
 District of New York against its landlord, New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation H+H ), and the New York City Economic 
 Development Corporation EDC ). The lawsuit alleges two principal claims against H+H and EDC: fraud in the inducement, and, in the 
 alternative, breach of contract in violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As alleged in the complaint, ARE-East 
 River Science Park, LLC s claims arise from H+H s and EDC s misrepresentations and concealment of material facts in connection with 
 a floodwall, which H+H and EDC are seeking to require ARE-East River Science Park, LLC to integrate into the development of the 
 Option Parcel. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC alleges that H+H s and EDC s misconduct have prevented it from commencing the 
 development of the Option Parcel. In light of the pending litigation, the closing date for the option and thus the commencement date for 
 construction of the third tower at the campus are presently indeterminate. Among other things, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC is 
 seeking significant damages and equitable relief to maintain the option. 
 This matter exposes us to potential losses ranging from zero to the full amount of the investment in the project aggregating 
 million as of September 30, 2024 , depending on any collection of damages and/or the ability to develop the project. We 
 performed a probability-weighted recoverability analysis based on initial estimates of various possible outcomes and determined no 
 impairment was present as of September 30, 2024 .

properties aggregating million operating RSF in key cluster locations, including 
 Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, Research Triangle, and New York City . We primarily focus 
 on developing Class A/A+ properties in AAA life science innovation cluster locations that offer the scale and strategic design integral to 
 our mega campus strategy. Strategically located near top academic medical institutions and equipped with curated amenities, services, 
 and transit access, our mega campuses are designed to support our tenants in attracting and retaining top talent, which we believe is a 
 key driver of tenant demand for our properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , all leases in which we are the lessor were classified as operating leases, with the exception of 
 direct financing lease . Our leases are described below. 
 Operating leases 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our properties were subject to operating lease agreements. of these properties are 
 subject to operating lease agreements that each contain a purchase option as described below: 
 (i) properties, representing land parcels, are subject to lease agreements that each contain an option for the lessee 
 to purchase the underlying asset from us at fair market value during each of the 30-day periods commencing on the dates 
 that are years , years , and years after the rent commencement date of . The remaining lease 
 term related to each of the land parcel s is years . 
 (ii) operating properties aggregating R SF o wned by our 1201 and 1208 Eastla ke Avenue East consolidated real 
 estate joint venture are subject to purchase options held by our partner in this joint venture, who is also a tenant 
 occupying RSF at these properties. One purchase option allows our partner to purchase our interest in 1208 
 Eastlake Avenue East for million in 2031 . Contingent upon the exercise of this option, the second purchase option 
 allows our partner to purchase our interest in 1201 Eastlake Avenue East for million in 2034 . Our partner s 
 remaining lease terms for its operating leases at 1201 and 1208 Eastlake Avenue East are years and years , 
 respectively. 
 We evaluated the impact of the purchase options on the classification of the existing operating leases and determined that 
 each lease continues to meet the criteria for classification as an operating lease. 
 Our leases generally contain options to extend lease terms at prevailing market rates at the time of expiration. Certain 
 operating leases contain early termination options that require advance notification and payment of a penalty, which in most cases is 
 substantial enough to be deemed economically disadvantageous by a tenant to exercise.

 Residual value risk management strategy 
 Our leases do not have guarantees of residual value on the underlying assets. We manage risk associated with the residual 
 value of our leased assets by (i) evaluating each potential acquisition of real estate to determine whether it meets our business 
 objective to invest primarily in high-demand markets, (ii) directly managing our leased properties, conducting frequent property 
 inspections, proactively addressing potential maintenance issues before they arise, and/or timely resolving any occurring issues, and 
 (iii) carefully selecting our tenants and monitoring their credit quality throughout their respective lease terms.

 remaining lease term of operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately years , including extension options that we 
 are reasonably certain to exercise, and the weighted-average discount rate was . The weighted-average discount rate is based on 
 the incremental borrowing rate estimated for each lease, which is the interest rate that we estimate we would have to pay to borrow on

 Included in the operating lease liability balance as of September 30, 2024 is the liability related to an amendment to our 
 existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus aggregating million RSF in our Cambridge 
 submarket, which extended the lease term by years from to . The amendment requires that we 
 prepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating million in two equal installments during the fourth 
 quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. Upon the execution of the amendment in July 2024, we recognized million ,

. We evaluate each investment to 
 determine whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. We evaluate investments in 
 which our ownership is equal to or greater than 20 , but less than or equal to 50 , of an investee s voting stock with a presumption 
 that we have this ability. For our investments in limited partnerships that maintain specific ownership accounts, we presume that such 
 ability exists when our ownership interest exceeds 3 to 5 . In addition to our ownership interest, we consider whether we have a 
 board seat or whether we participate in the investee s policy-making process, among other criteria, to determine if we have the ability to 
 exert significant influence, but not control, over an investee. If we determine that we have such ability, we account for the investment 
 under the equity method, as described below. 
 Investments accounted for under the equity method 
 Under the equity method of accounting, we initially recognize our investment at cost and subsequently adjust the carrying 
 amount of the investment for our share of earnings or losses reported by the investee, distributions received, and other-than-temporary 
 impairments. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had investments in limited partnerships maintaining specific ownership accounts for each 
 investor, which were accounted for under the equity method. These investments aggregated million . Our ownership interest in 
 each of these investments was greater than 5 . 
 Investments that do not qualify for the equity method of accounting 
 For investees over which we determine that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control, we account 
 for each investment depending on whether it is an investment in a (i) publicly traded company, (ii) privately held entity that reports NAV 
 per share, or (iii) privately held entity that does not report NAV per share, as described below. 
 Investments in publicly traded companies 
 Our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are 
 presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value classified in investment income (loss) in our 
 consolidated statements of operations. The fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies are determined based on sales 
 prices or quotes available on securities exchanges. 
 Investments in privately held companies 
 Our investments in privately held entities without readily determinable fair values consist of (i) investments in privately held 
 entities that report NAV per share and (ii) investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share. These investments are 
 accounted for as follows: 
 Investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share 
 Investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share, such as our privately held investments in limited partnerships, 
 are presented at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient, with changes in fair value classified in investment income (loss) in our 
 consolidated statements of operations. We use NAV per share reported by limited partnerships generally without adjustment, unless we 
 are aware of information indicating that the NAV reported by a limited partnership does not accurately reflect the fair value of the 
 investment at our reporting date. 
 Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share 
 Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share are accounted for using a measurement alternative, 
 under which these investments are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes classified 
 in investment income (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 An observable price arises from an orderly transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, which is 
 observed by an investor without expending undue cost and effort. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity 
 transactions of the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity 
 transactions related to the same issuer. To determine whether these transactions are indicative of an observable price change, we 
 evaluate, among other factors, whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution 
 preferences, and conversion rights to the investments we hold.

 terms. O ur investments in privately held entities that report NAV generally have expected initial terms in excess of years. The 
 weighted-average remaining term during which these investments are expected to be liquidated was years as of September 30,

 balances represent the carrying amounts of investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV for which impairments have been recognized in accordance with 
 the measurement alternative guidance described in Investments in Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited consolidated financial 
 statements. 
 Real estate assets classified as held for sale measured at fair value less costs to sell 
 Our real estate assets classified as held for sale and measured at fair value less costs to sell are presented in the table above. 
 These properties are subsets of our total real estate assets classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 2023 , respectively. The fair values for these real estate assets were estimated based on executed purchase and sale agreements, 
 letters of intent, or valuations provided by third-party real estate brokers . Refer to Investments in real estate in Note 2 Summary of 
 significant accounting policies and Note 15 Assets classified as held for sale to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for 
 additional information. 
 Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV 
 Our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes 
 and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. These investments are adjusted based on the observable price changes in 
 orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Further adjustments are not made until another 
 observable transaction occurs. Therefore, the determination of fair values of our investments in privately held entities that do not report 
 NAV does not involve significant estimates and assumptions or subjective and complex judgments. 
 We also subject our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV to a qualitative assessment for indicators of 
 impairment. If indicators of impairment are present, we are required to estimate the investment s fair value and immediately recognize 
 an impairment charge in an amount equal to the investment s carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , our conditional asset retirement obligations liability primarily consisted of 
 the soil and groundwater remediation liabilities associated with certain of our properties. Some of our properties may contain asbestos 
 or may be subjected to other hazardous or toxic substances, which, under certain conditions, requires remediation. We engage 
 independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I or similar environmental assessments at our properties. This type of 
 assessment generally includes a site inspection, interviews, and a public records review; asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold surveys; 
 subsurface sampling; and other testing. We recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation (including 
 asbestos) when the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, environmental laws and regulations subject our 
 tenants, and potentially us, to liability that may result from our tenants routine handling of hazardous substances and wastes as part of 
 their operations at our properties. These assessments and investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any additional 
 environmental liability we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements or that would require 
 additional disclosures or recognition in our consolidated financial statements.

 of the properties . These properties are currently 100 leased for a weighted-average remaining lease term of years to a single 
 tenant with whom we have a long-established relationship. The important tenant relationship and strategic nature of these properties 
 resulted in a limited pool of buyers we would be willing to sell this asset to and, as a result, the likelihood of selling this asset was not 
 probable until the buyer committed in October 2024 to acquire these properties. As a result, in October 2024, we recognized an 
 impairment charge aggregating million to reduce the carrying amounts of these properties to the expected sales price less costs 
 to sell. 
 In October 2024, operatin g properties aggregating RSF and land parcels aggregating million SF in our

 sale of these assets to buyers that are expected to develop residential properties on these sites for an aggregate sales price of 
 approximately million during the fourth quarter of 2024. In October 2024, upon management obtaining the authority to sell these 
 assets and agreeing to acceptable terms, we recognized impairment charges aggregating million to reduce the carrying amounts 
 of these properties to the expected aggregate sales price less costs to sell.

Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax 
 purposes. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE), an S P 500 company, is a best-in-class, mission-driven life science 
 REIT making a positive and lasting impact on the world. As the pioneer of the life science real estate niche with our founding in 1994, 
 Alexandria is the preeminent and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer of collaborative mega campuses in AAA life science 
 innovation cluster locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, Research Triangle, 
 and New York City. As of September 30, 2024 , Alexandria has a total market capitalization of 33.1 billion and an asset base in North 
 America that includes 41.8 million RSF of ope rating properties, 5.3 million RSF of Class A/A+ properties undergoing construction, and 
 one committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the next two years . Alexandria has a longstanding and proven 
 track record of developing Class A/A+ properties clustered in mega campuses that provide our innovative tenants with highly dynamic 
 and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, 
 efficiency, creativity, and success. Alexandria also provides strategic capital to transformative life science companies through our 
 venture capital platform. We believe our unique business model and diligent underwriting ensure a high-quality and diverse tenant base 
 that results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. 
 As of September 30, 2024 : 
 Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent ed 53 of our annual rental revenue; 
 Approximately 96 of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations 
 approximating 3 t hat were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; 
 Approximately 93 o f our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay 
 substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other 
 operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent; 
 Approximately 92 of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) provided for the recapture of capital expenditures 
 (such as HVAC maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would 
 typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases; and 
 80 of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing tenant base. 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and stockholder returns based on a multifaceted platform 
 of internal and external growth. A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A/A+ properties located in collaborative 
 mega campuses in AAA life science innovation clusters. Our mega campuses are designed for scalability, offering our tenants a clear 
 path for growth, including through our future developments and redevelopments. Strategically located near top academic medical 
 institutions and equipped with curated amenities, services, and transit access, our mega campuses are designed to support our tenants 
 in attracting and retaining top talent, which we believe is a key driver of tenant demand for our properties. Our strategy also includes 
 drawing upon our deep and broad real estate and life science relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading tenants and 
 to source additional value-creation real estate.

 options to re-lease or reposition from single tenancy to multi-tenancy that will remain in our same property pool at Alexandria Technology Square in our Cambridge 
 submarket for 182,054 RSF and at 409 Illinois Street, where we have an ownership interest of 25.0 , in our Mission Bay submarket for 234,249 RSF (we are in early 
 discussions with a tenant to lease approximately 50 of this space); and (ii) non-laboratory space for which we are evaluating options to re-lease generally in their 
 current condition, reposition, or, subject to market conditions, may undergo a conversion through redevelopment in our Austin submarket for 247,246 RSF and in our 
 Research Triangle market for 104,531 RSF. Should we commence redevelopment efforts, these properties would be placed into our active pipeline and removed from 
 our same property pool; otherwise, they would remain in our same property pool. We expect downtime on the 768,080 RSF to range from 12 to 24 months on a

Investments in real estate 
 A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new 
 Class A/A+ properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in 
 collaborative mega campuses in AAA life science innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, generic, and 
 reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development and 
 redevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and 
 redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher 
 occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our pre-construction 
 activities are undertaken in order to prepare the property for its intended use and include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and 
 other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements.

 (2) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we filed a lawsuit against the New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation for fraud and breach of contract concerning our

Results of operations 
 We present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results 
 and provide context for the disclosures included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our 
 subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We believe that such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of 
 the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to 
 period. We also believe that this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate 
 operating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of assets classified as held for sale are related to corporate- 
 level decisions to dispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt are related to corporate-level financing 
 decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, 
 impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments, and acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations of 
 executive officers are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level 
 non-real estate investment decisions and external market conditions. Impairments of non-real estate investments are not related to the 
 operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate investments when their fair values 
 decrease below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions outside of our control. Significant 
 items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure for current periods are described in further detail in Item 2. Key items 
 included in net income attributable to Alexandria s common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 
 2023 and the related per share amounts were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Impairment of real estate 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized real estate impairment charges aggregating 36.5 million , 
 which primarily consisted of the following: 
 Impairment charges aggregating 30.8 million primarily consisting of the pre-acquisition costs related to two potential 
 acquisitions aggregating 1.4 million RSF of future development in our Greater Boston market. We executed purchase 
 agreements for these potential acquisitions with the total purchase price aggregating 366.8 million in 2020 and 2022, and we 
 initially expected to close these acquisitions after 2024. Our intent for each site included the demolition of existing buildings 
 upon expiration of the existing in-place leases and the development of life science properties. During the three months ended 
 June 30, 2024, due to the existing macroeconomic environment that negatively impacted the financial outlooks for these 
 projects, we decided to no longer proceed with these acquisitions, resulting in the recognition of impairment charges. 
 Impairment charge of 5.7 million to adjust the carrying amount of one property in Canada that continued to meet the held-for- 
 sale classification to the sales price under negotiation with a potential buyer less costs to sell. We expect to sell this property

 Impairment charge aggregating 20.6 million to further reduce the carrying amounts of primarily three non-laboratory 
 properties located in our Greater Boston and Texa s markets to their respective estimated fair values less costs to sell. W e 
 completed the sale of two of these properties in December 2023 and January 2024 , and we expect to sell the remaining real 
 estate asset during the next 12 months. 
 Impairment charge aggregating 17.1 million to fully write down the carrying amount of our one remaining property in Asia. 
 Investment income 
 D uring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized an investment income aggregating 14.9 million . This 
 income primarily consisted of gains of 51.2 million from increases in fair values of our non-real estate investments in privately held 
 entities that do not report NAV and in publicly traded companies, partially offset by impairment charges of 37.8 million primarily related 
 to non-real estate investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized investment loss aggregating 204.1 million , which

(1) Our assumptions presented in the table above are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as Forward-looking statements under 
 Part I; Item 1A. Risk factors and Item 7. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on Form 10-K for 
 the year ended December 31, 2023 , as well as in Item 1A. Risk factors within Part II Other information of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. To the extent our full- 
 year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance. 
 (2) Reduction in the midpoint of our guidance range for straight-line rent revenue by 22 million is primarily attributable to (i) the write-off of a deferred rent receivable of 
 9 million related to the lease termination and a payment of 10 million from a tenant at 409 Illinois Street in our Mission Bay submarket, a 234,249 RSF property owned 
 by our consolidated real estate joint venture for which we have an ownership interest of 25 , and (ii) a change in the expected stabilization date from the fourth quarter 
 of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025 at our fully leased development project at 230 Harriet Tubman Way in our South San Francisco submarket as reported in our Form 
 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023. 
 (3) Reduction in the midpoint of our guidance range for general and administrative expense by 5 million is primarily attributable to the realization of savings associated with 
 overall efficiencies, including enhanced cost control measures, incremental use of technology, streamlined processes, and optimization of execution in connection with 
 the sale of non-core assets not integral to our mega campus strategy. 
 (4) Represents realized gains and losses included in funds from operations per share diluted, as adjusted, and excludes significant impairments realized on non-real 
 estate investments, if any. Refer to Note 7 Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional details.

Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 
 We present components of balance sheet and operating results information for the noncontrolling interest share of our 
 consolidated real estate joint ventures and for our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to help investors 
 estimate balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. These amounts are estimated by 
 computing, for each joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, the noncontrolling interest percentage of each financial 
 item to arrive at the cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented. In addition, for our real estate joint ventures 
 that we do not control and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to the unconsolidated real estate joint 
 ventures to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. Refer to Note 4 Consolidated and unconsolidated real 
 estate joint ventures to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further discussion.

 We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other 
 construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital 
 expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of dividends through net cash provided 
 by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, 
 borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, and issuances of additional debt 
 and/or equity securities. 
 We also expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, 
 generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating 
 activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. 
 For additional information on our liquidity requirements related to our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to 
 Note 5 Leases and Note 10 Secured and unsecured senior debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1. 
 Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows: 
 Retain cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for 
 investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions; 
 Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; 
 Improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital; 
 Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, 
 secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, strategic real estate joint ventures, non-real estate investment sales, and 
 common stock; 
 Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth; 
 Maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities; 
 Maintain solid credit metrics; 
 Prudently manage variable-rate debt exposure; 
 Maintain a large, unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility; 
 Fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities; 
 Manage a disciplined level of development and redevelopment projects as a percentage of our gross real estate assets; 
 and 
 Maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in development and redevelopment projects.

Operating activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental 
 rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of 
 development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. Net cash provided by 
 operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 28.4 million to 1.23 billion , compared to 1.20 billion 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to cash flows generated from our development and 
 redevelopment projects place into service since January 1, 2023.

The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 , was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for real estate purchases and additions, partially 
 offset by lower proceeds from sales of real estate. Refer to Note 3 Investments in real estate to our unaudited consolidated financial 
 statements in Item 1 for additional information.

(1) Refer to Dispositions in Item 2 for additional detail. We expect to fund our remaining capital requirements for the year ending December 31, 2024 with real estate 
 dispositions. As of the date of this report, we completed real estate dispositions aggregating 319.2 million , have additional pending transactions subject to (i) non- 
 refundable deposits aggregating 577.2 million and (ii) executed letters of intent and/or purchase and sale agreements aggregating 602.5 million and forward equity 
 sales agreements aggregating 28 million , which in aggregate, represents 98 of the 1.55 billion midpoint of our guidance rang e. We do not expect to issue additional 
 equity in 2024 beyond the existing forward equity sales agreements outstanding. 
 (2) In July 2024, we executed an amendment to our existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus in our Cambridge submarket, 
 which requires that we prepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating 270.0 million in two equal installments during the fourth quarter of 2024 
 and the first quarter of 2025. 
 (3) The increase in cash expected to be held at December 31, 2024 is primarily due to changes in the mix and timing of pending dispositions that are subject to non- 
 refundable deposits or subject to executed letters of intent and/or purchase and sale agreements that are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. This cash is 
 expected to reduce our 2025 debt capital needs. 
 (4) Represents 1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable issued in February 2024. Subject to market conditions, we may seek additional opportunities in 2024 to fund 
 all or a portion of the proceeds necessary for the repayment of our 600.0 million of 3.45 unsecured senior notes payable due on April 30, 2025 through the issuance 
 of additional unsecured senior notes payable that is not assumed in our current 2024 guidance . 
 The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable real estate transaction and 
 capital market environments, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development 
 and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and 
 uncertainties, including those discussed as Forward-looking statements under Part I; Item 1A. Risk factors and Item 7. 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
 ended December 31, 2023 ; as well as in Item 1A. Risk factors within Part II Other information of this quarterly report on Form 10- 
 Q. We expect to update our forecast for key sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis. 

91 

Sources of capital 
 Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends 
 We expect to retain 400 million to 500 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock 
 dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending December 31, 2024 . For purposes of this calculation, 
 changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. For the year ending December 31, 2024 , 
 we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly development and redevelopment projects expected to be delivered, contributions 
 from Same Properties, and recently acquired income-producing properties to contribute increases in income from rentals, net operating 
 income, and cash flows. We anticipate contractual near-term growth in annual net operating income (cash basis) of 57 million related 
 to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent 
 period. Refer to Cash flows in Item 2 for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 . 
 Debt 
 We expect to fund a portion of our capital needs for 2024 from issuances under our commercial paper program, issuances of 
 unsecured senior notes payable, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and/or borrowings under our secured 
 construction loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our unsecured senior line of credit had aggregate commitments of 5.0 billion and bore an interest 
 rate of SOFR plus 0.855 . In addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 
 0.145 based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. Based upon our ability to achieve certain annual sustainability targets, the 
 interest rate and facility fee rate are also subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to four basis points with respect to the 
 interest rate and up to one basis point with respect to the facility fee rate . 
 Based on certain sustainability metrics achieved in accordance with the terms of our unsecured senior line of credit 
 agreement, the borrowing rate was reduced for a one-year period by two basis points to SOFR plus 0.855 , from SOFR plus 0.875 , 
 and the facility fee was reduced by 0.5 basis point to 0.145 from 0.15 . As of September 30, 2024 , we had no outstanding balance 
 on our unsecured line of credit . 
 In September 2024, we amended and restated our unsecured senior line of credit to, among other changes, extend the 
 maturity date from January 22, 2028 to January 22, 2030 , including extension options that we control . 
 Our commercial paper program provides us with the ability to issue up to 2.5 billion of commercial paper note s with a maturity 
 of generally 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance . Our commercial paper program is 
 backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity 
 under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance under our commercial paper program. We use borrowings 
 under the program to fund short-term capital needs. The notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary 
 terms in the commercial paper market. They are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market 
 conditions at the time of issuance. In the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial 
 paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the 
 unsecured senior line of credit. The commercial paper notes sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were issued at a 
 weighted-average yield to maturity o f 5.55 . As of September 30, 2024 , we had an outstanding balance of 454.6 million under our 
 commercial paper program with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.05 . 
 In February 2024, we issued 1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.48 
 and a weighted-average maturity of 23.1 years . The unsecured senior notes consisted o f 400.0 million of 5.25 unsecured senior 
 notes due 2036 and 600.0 million of 5.625 unsecured senior notes due 2054 .

Real estate dispositions and issuances of common equity 
 We expect to continue to focus on the disciplined execution of select sales of real estate. Future sales will provide an important 
 source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed acquisitions and our development and redevelopment projects, 
 and also provide significant capital for growth. For the year ending December 31, 2024 , we expect real estate dispositions and 
 issuances of common equity to range from 1.1 billion t o 2.1 billion . The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted 
 sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold. 
 Refer to Note 3 Investments in real estate, Note 4 Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, and 
 Note 13 Stockholders equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 and to Dispositions in Item 2 for 
 additional information on our real estate dispositions. 
 As a REIT, we are generally subject to a 100 tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the IRS characterizes as 
 prohibited transactions. We do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. However, unless we meet certain 
 safe harbor requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances 
 of the sale. Our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. Refer to Item 1A. Risk factors of our 
 annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information about the prohibited transaction tax. 
 Common equity transactions 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating 28 million 
 to sell 230 thousand shares of common stock under our ATM program at an average price of 122.32 (before underwriting discounts) . 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the remaining aggregate amount available under our ATM program for future sales of common stock was 
 1.47 billion . 
 Other sources 
 As a well-known seasoned issuer, we may, from time to time, issue securities at our discretion based on our needs and market 
 conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital. 
 Additionally, we, together with joint venture partners, hold interests in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our 
 financial statements. These existing joint ventures provide significant equity capital to fund a portion of our future construction spend, 
 and our joint venture partners may also contribute equity into these entities for financing-related activities. F rom October 1, 2024 
 through December 31, 2027 , we expect to receive capital contributions aggregating 1.0 billion from existing consolidated real estate 
 joint venture partners to fund construction. During the year ending December 31, 2024 , contributions from noncontrolling interests from 
 existing joint venture partners are expected to aggregate 430.0 million . 

93 

Uses of capital 
 
 Summary of capital expenditures 
 One of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. 
 We currently have projects in our development and redevelopment pipeline aggregating 5.3 million RSF of Class A/A+ properties 
 undergoing construction, one committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the next two years , and 1.9 million 
 RSF of priority anticipated development and redevelopment projects . We incur capitalized construction costs related to development, 
 redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. We also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, 
 property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or 
 construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to 
 New Class A/A+ development and redevelopment properties: current projects and Summary of capital expenditures in Item 2 for 
 more information on our capital expenditures. 
 We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for 
 its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized 
 interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 249.4 million and 274.9 million , respectively, was classified in 
 investments in real estate in our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in capitalized interest was related to a lower weighted- 
 average capitalized cost basis of 8.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 9.6 billion for the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023 , partially offset by an increase in weighted-average interest rate used to capitalize interest to 3.96 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Property taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction, administration, legal fees, and office 
 costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is 
 undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, 
 redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, aggregating 76.8 million and 74.5 million , and property taxes, insurance 
 on real estate, and indirect project costs aggre gating 96.5 million an d 96.7 million du ring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 and 2023 , respectively. 
 The decrease in our capitalized costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period in 2023 , 
 was primarily driven by a reduction in the average real estate basis of our development and redevelopment pipeline following significant 
 deliveries in 2023 , most of which were placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023. Pre-construction activities include 
 entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building 
 improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective 
 tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of 
 buildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain 
 other direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance 
 are expensed as incurred. 
 Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total 
 expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10 reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction 
 activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased 
 by approximately 42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 We use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. We are 
 required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease 
 transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. During the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024 , we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of 67.0 million . Costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a 
 lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, 
 are expensed as incurred. 

94 

Acquisitions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the purchase price of our completed acquisitions aggregated 
 201.8 million . As of September 30, 2024 , the total purchase price of our pending acquisitions under executed letters of intent and/or 
 purchase and sale agreements expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025 aggregated 47.6 million and 47.8 
 million , respectivel y . In October 2024, we completed one acquisition pending as of September 30, 2024 for a purchase price of 47.6 
 million . For additional information, refer to Note 16 Subsequent events to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1. 
 For the year ending December 31, 2024 , we expect real estate acquisitions to range from 250 million to 750 million . 
 Refer to Acquisitions in Note 3 Investments in real estate and to Note 4 Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate 
 joint ventures to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1, and Acquisitions in Item 2 for information on our 
 acquisitions. 
 
 Dividends 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we paid common stock dividends of 671.4 million and 
 633.0 million , respectively. The increase of 38.3 million in dividends paid on our common stock during the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , was primarily due to an increase in the number of 
 common shares outstanding subsequent to January 1, 2023 as a result of settled forward equity sales agreements, and an increase in 
 the related dividends paid to 3.84 per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.66 per common 
 share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Secured notes payable 
 Secured notes payable as of September 30, 2024 consisted of three notes secured by two properties . Our secured notes 
 payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 8.39 . 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the total book value of our investments in real estate securing debt was approximately 364.3 million . As of 
 September 30, 2024 , our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, comprised 
 approximately 587 thousand and 144.4 million of fixed-rate debt and unhedged variable-rate debt, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our unconsolidated real estate joint venture, in which we hold a 10 ownership interest, located at 
 1655 and 1725 Third Street in our Mission Bay submarket , has a 600.0 million secured loan outstanding maturing on March 10, 2025 . 
 The unconsolidated real estate joint venture is in the process of working with prospective lenders to refinance this debt. In the event that 
 all or a portion of the debt cannot be refinanced, we may consider contributing additional equity into this unconsolidated real estate joint 
 venture . 
 
 Unsecured senior notes payable and unsecured senior line of credit

 Estimated interest payments 
 Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest 
 payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of September 30, 2024 , 95.3 of our debt was fixed-rate deb t . For additional 
 information regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 Secured and unsecured senior debt to our unaudited consolidated financial 
 statements in Item 1. 
 
 Ground lease obligations 
 Ground lease obligations as of September 30, 2024 included leases for 36 of our properties and accounted for approximately 
 9 of our total number of properties. Among these 36 properties, 17 properties are subject to ground leases with a weighted-average 
 remaining lease term of 41 years, including extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. These leases are with a single 
 lessor in our Greater Stanford submarket, with whom we have extended three ground leases over the past 10 years. 
 Our remaining 19 properties subject to ground leases are located across multiple submarkets and have remaining lease terms 
 ranging from approximately 46 to 97 years . The weighted-average remaining lease term of these ground leases is 70 years , including 
 extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. 
 In many cases, we seek to extend our ground leases well ahead of their scheduled contractual expirations. If we are 
 successful in extending ground leases, we could see significant up-front or increased recurring future payments to the ground lessor 
 and/or increased ground lease expense, which may require us to increase our capital funding needs. 
 Operating lease agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the 
 lessee aggregated 1.1 billion and 25.3 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , our operating lease liability, calculated as the 
 present value of the remaining payments aggregating 1.1 billion under our operating lease agreements, including our extension 
 options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was 648.3 million , which was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, 
 and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 , the weighted-average remaining lease term of 
 operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately 49 years , including extension options that we are reasonably certain to 
 exercise, and the weighted-average discount rate was 5.1 . Our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial 
 direct leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated 776.7 
 million . We classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Lease accounting in Note 2 
 Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information. 
 Included in the aforementioned September 30, 2024 balances is the ground lease recorded in July 2024 upon our execution of 
 an amendment to our existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus aggregating 1.2 million 
 RSF in our Cambridge submarket, which extended the term by 24 years from January 1, 2065 to December 31, 2088 . The amendment 
 requires that we prepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating 270.0 million in two equal installments 
 during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. Alexandria Technology Square is a foundational mega campus in the 
 heart of the global life science ecosystem in Cambridge and is the Greater Boston base of operations of key strategic tenants such as 
 Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Mass General Brigham. Securing this ground lease 
 through December 2088 significantly enhances the long-term value of our investment in this critical mega campus. 
 
 Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024 , remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing 
 development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated 1.3 billion . We expect payments for these 
 obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease 
 the construction of certain projects, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. 

96 

As of September 30, 2024 , the purchase price of pending acquisitions under executed letters of intent and/or purchase and 
 sale agreements expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025, aggregated 47.6 million and 47.8 million , 
 respectively . In October 2024, we completed one acquisition pending as of September 30, 2024 for a purchase price of 47.6 million . 
 For additional information, refer to Note 16 Subsequent events to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1. I n 
 addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating 29.5 million primarily related to our development and 
 redevelopment projects. 
 We are committed to funding approximately 406.0 million related to our non-real estate investments. These funding 
 commitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report NAV and expire at various dates over 
 the next 12 years , with a weighted-average expiration of 8.1 years as of September 30, 2024 . 
 In July 2024, we executed an amendment to our existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square mega 
 campus in our Cambridge submarket, which requires that we prepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating 
 270.0 million in two equal installments during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 . Refer to Operating lease 
 agreements above for additional details. 
 Exposure to environmental liabilities 
 In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain 
 the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not 
 revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of 
 operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I 
 environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to 
 certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. 
 
 Foreign currency translation gains and losses 
 The following table presents the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Alexandria Real Estate 
 Equities, Inc. s stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the changes in the foreign exchange 
 rates for our real estate investments in Canada (in thousands). We reclassify unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses 
 into net income as we dispose of these holdings.

Inflation 
 As of September 30, 2024 , approximately 93 of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which 
 require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and 
 other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 96 of our leases (on an annual rental 
 revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations approximating 3 that were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer 
 price index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to 
 significant risks from inflation. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, 
 including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured senior notes 
 payable, and borrowings under our secured construction loans, and secured loans held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.

Definitions and reconciliations 
 This section contains additional information on certain non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most 
 directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and the reasons why we use these 
 supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other 
 terms used in this report. 
 
 Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. s common 
 stockholders 
 GAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish 
 over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the 
 Nareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from 
 operations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is 
 helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as 
 adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without 
 having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital 
 structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other 
 corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties. 
 The 2018 White Paper published by the Nareit Board of Governors (the Nareit White Paper defines funds from operations as 
 net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus 
 depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated 
 partnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability 
 period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating 
 performance of the properties during the corresponding period. 
 We compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White 
 Paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non- 
 real estate investments, impairment of real estate primarily consisting of pre-acquisition costs incurred in connection with acquisitions 
 we decided to no longer pursue, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock 
 compensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the 
 amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. We compute the amount that is allocable to our 
 unvested restricted stock awards using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, we allocate net income (after amounts 
 attributable to noncontrolling interests) to common stockholders and to unvested restricted stock awards by applying the respective 
 weighted-average shares outstanding during each quarter-to-date and year-to-date period. This may result in a difference of the 
 summation of the quarter-to-date and year-to-date amounts. Neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, 
 should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indications of financial performance, or to 
 cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the 
 availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. 
 The following table reconciles net income to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint ventures 
 attributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the three and nine months ended

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision- 
 making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated 
 as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses 
 on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. 
 Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains or losses and impairments that result from our 
 non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations 
 outside of total revenues. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the 
 operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and 
 financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and 
 variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early 
 extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We 
 believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized 
 gains or losses on non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to 
 period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related 
 to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating 
 performance of our properties. 
 In addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for 
 investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or 
 future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, 
 it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should 
 not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. 
 In order to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA margin, we divide Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues as presented in our 
 consolidated statements of operations. We believe that this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional 
 useful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities. 
 We are not able to forecast fourth quarter net income without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a reconciliation 
 for Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amount of items 
 that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and financing decisions, as 
 well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, 
 impairment of real estate, and impairment of non-real estate investments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant 
 but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially misleading for our investors.

Annual rental revenue 
 
 Annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with GAAP, including 
 the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and -built landlord improvements, for leases in effect as of the end of the 
 period, related to our operating RSF. Annual rental revenue is presented using 100 of the annual rental revenue from our consolidated 
 properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Annual rental revenue per RSF is 
 computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100 of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of the RSF of 
 properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of September 30, 2024 , approximately 93 of our leases (on an annual 
 rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs 
 and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Annual 
 rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants related to these 
 operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Capitalization rates 
 Capitalization rates are calculated based on net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized, 
 excluding lease termination fees, on stabilized operating assets for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or 
 near-term prospective net operating income. 
 Capitalized interest 
 We capitalize interest cost as a cost of a project during periods for which activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or 
 reposition a project for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has 
 been incurred. Activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or reposition a project include pre-construction activities such as 
 entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building 
 improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective 
 tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of 
 buildings. If we cease activities necessary to prepare a project for its intended use, interest costs related to such project are expensed 
 as incurred. 
 Cash interest 
 Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of 
 loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). Refer to Fixed-charge coverage ratio in this section for a reconciliation of interest expense, 
 the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest. 

103 

Class A/A+ properties and AAA locations 
 Class A/A+ properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and 
 collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, 
 efficiency, creativity, and success. Class A/A+ properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar 
 properties. AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. 
 Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction 
 A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new 
 Class A/A+ properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in 
 collaborative mega campuses in AAA life science innovation clusters. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, 
 generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development 
 and redevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development 
 and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher 
 occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. 
 Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory facilities. 
 Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into laboratory space. 
 We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A/A+ laboratory space without 
 first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A/A+ properties. 
 Priority anticipated projects are those most likely to commence future ground-up development or first-time conversion from 
 non-laboratory space to laboratory space prior to our other future projects, pending market conditions and leasing negotiations. 
 Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of 
 construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time 
 required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and 
 are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to 
 generate significant revenue and cash flows. 
 Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) amounts to bring certain 
 acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of 
 acquisition) and (ii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready laboratory space to foster the growth of promising 
 early- and growth-stage life science companies. 
 Revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of 
 a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from Class B to Class A/A+. 
 Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized 
 property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space. 
 Dividend payout ratio (common stock) 
 Dividend payout ratio (common stock) is the ratio of the absolute dollar amount of dividends on our common stock (shares of 
 common stock outstanding on the respective record dates multiplied by the related dividend per share) to funds from operations 
 attributable to Alexandria s common stockholders diluted, as adjusted. 
 Dividend yield 
 Dividend yield for the quarter represents the annualized quarter dividend divided by the closing common stock price at the end 
 of the quarter.

Fixed-charge coverage ratio 
 Fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest and 
 fixed charges. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing 
 obligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus 
 capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). 
 The following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in 
 accordance with GAAP, to cash interest and computes fixed-charge coverage ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

We are not able to forecast fourth quarter net income without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a reconciliation 
 for fixed-charge coverage ratio on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amount 
 of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and financing 
 decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate 
 investments, impairment of real estate, and impairment of non-real estate investments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may 
 produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially misleading for our investors.

Initial stabilized yield (unlevered) 
 Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment 
 in the property. For this calculation, we exclude any tenant-funded and -built landlord improvements from our investment in the property. 
 Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our development and redevelopment projects are 
 generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial 
 stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We 
 expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields 
 or costs. 
 Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the 
 term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis, and any amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant- 
 funded and -built landlord improvements. 
 Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have 
 elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.

Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants 
 Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded 
 companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than 10 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 , as 
 reported by Bloomberg Professional Services. Credit ratings from Moody s Ratings and S P Global Ratings reflect credit ratings of the 
 tenant s parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant s parent entity will satisfy the tenant s lease obligation upon such 
 tenant s default. We monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. Material changes that cause a tenant s 
 market capitalization to decrease below 10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their 
 exclusion from this measure.

Joint venture financial information 
 We present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are 
 not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with GAAP. We present the proportionate share of certain financial line items 
 as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through 
 contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100 , we apply the noncontrolling interest economic 
 ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component 
 presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or 
 by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each 
 financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. 
 The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent 
 our legal claim to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity 
 holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally 
 entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and 
 claims have been repaid or satisfied. 
 We believe that this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our 
 partially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial 
 statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in 
 our consolidated results. 
 The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an 
 analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures assets, 
 liabilities, or results of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the 
 unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding 
 of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our 
 consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative 
 to our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a 
 supplemental measure of evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated 
 debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. Refer to Adjusted 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this section for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We are not able to forecast fourth quarter net income without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a reconciliation 
 for net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the 
 timing and/or amount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital 
 events, and financing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on 
 non-real estate investments, impairment of real estate, and impairment of non-real estate investments. Our attempt to predict these 
 amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially misleading for our investors.

Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial 
 measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint 
 ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or 
 losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. We believe net operating 
 income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects 
 those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure 
 for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net 
 operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent, amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue, 
 and amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and -built landlord improvements adjustments required by GAAP. We 
 believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it 
 eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and tenant-funded and -built 
 landlord improvements. 

110 

Furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties 
 because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, 
 which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the initial 
 stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. 
 Net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the 
 results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real 
 estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, 
 because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. 
 Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate 
 to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the 
 current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in 
 the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration 
 in market conditions. We also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that 
 occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. 
 Therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property 
 level. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as 
 losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in 
 determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and 
 maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property 
 taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate 
 compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, rent, and supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We 
 calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues. 
 We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should 
 be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income 
 should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows 
 as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions. 
 Operating statistics 
 We present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, 
 leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors 
 because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy 
 percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100 , excluding RSF at properties classified as held for sale, for all 
 properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint 
 ventures. For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to Annual rental revenue in this section. 
 
 Same property comparisons 
 As a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from 
 assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently 
 placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show 
 significant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or 
 annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the 
 comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results 
 to align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management s discussion and analysis of our financial 
 condition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day 
 in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any 
 time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate 
 entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. Additionally, 
 termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. Refer to Same properties in Item 2 for additional information. 
 Stabilized occupancy date 
 The stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95 or 
 greater. 

111 

Tenant recoveries 
 Tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and 
 maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses 
 are incurred and the tenant s obligation to reimburse us arises. 
 We classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenues in 
 income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues 
 and tenant recoveries in Results of operations in Item 2 because we believe it promotes investors understanding of our operating 
 results. We believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover 
 operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, 
 common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant 
 variability to components of our operating expenses.

 Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income 
 
 Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we 
 believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it 
 reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is 
 derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security 
 interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding diluted 
 From time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements Forward 
 Agreements ), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our development and redevelopment projects, and for general working 
 capital purposes. We are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our Forward Agreements under the treasury stock method 
 while the Forward Agreements are outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 , we had Forward Agreements outstanding to sell an 
 aggregate of 230 thousand shares of common stock . Refer to Note 13 Stockholders equity to our unaudited consolidated financial 
 statements in Item 1 for additional information. 
 The weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating EPS diluted, funds from operations per 
 share diluted, and funds from operations per share diluted, as adjusted, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest rate risk 
 The primary market risk to which we believe we may be exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, 
 including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors 
 that are beyond our control. 
 In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate 
 risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate hedge agreements, caps, floors, and 
 other interest rate exchange contracts. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest 
 rates may carry additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedge agreements. As of September 30, 
 2024 , we did not have any outstanding interest rate hedge agreements. 
 Our future earnings and fair values relating to our outstanding debt are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of 
 interest. The following tables illustrate the effect of a 1 change in interest rates, assuming a zero percent interest rate floor, on our 
 fixed- and variable-rate debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Annualized effect on future earnings due to variable-rate debt: 

Rate increase of 1 

(1,166) 

Rate decrease of 1 

1,166 

Effect on fair value of total consolidated debt: 

Rate increase of 1 

(824,796) 

Rate decrease of 1 

945,937 

These amounts are determined by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings as of 
 September 30, 2024 . These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in 
 such an environment. Furthermore, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our 
 exposure to the change. Because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity 
 analyses assume no changes in our capital structure. 
 Equity price risk 
 We have exposure to equity price market risk because we hold equity investments in publicly traded companies and privately 
 held entities. All of our investments in actively traded public companies are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
 Our investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share are measured at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient to fair 
 value. Our equity investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share are measured at cost less impairments, 
 adjusted for observable price changes during the period. Changes in fair value of public investments, changes in NAV per share 
 reported by privately held entities, and observable price changes of privately held entities that do not report NAV per share are 
 classified as investment income in our consolidated statements of operations. There is no assurance that future declines in value will 
 not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10 change in the 
 value of our equity investments would have on earnings as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Equity price risk: 

Fair value increase of 10 

151,933 

Fair value decrease of 10 

(151,933) 

114 

Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our subsidiaries operating in Canada. The functional 
 currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies in each respective country. Gains or losses resulting from the translation 
 of our foreign subsidiaries balance sheets and statements of operations are classified in accumulated other comprehensive income 
 (loss) as a separate component of total equity and are excluded from net income (loss). Gains or losses will be reflected in our 
 consolidated statements of operations when there is a sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete or 
 substantially complete liquidation of the investment. The following tables illustrate the effect that a 10 change in foreign currency rates 
 relative to the U.S. dollar would have on our potential future earnings and on the fair value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
 based on our current operating assets outside the U.S. as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Effect on potential future earnings due to foreign currency exchange rate: 

Rate increase of 10 

223 

Rate decrease of 10 

(223) 

Effect on the fair value of net investment in foreign subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate: 

Rate increase of 10 

40,407 

Rate decrease of 10 

(40,407) 

The sensitivity analyses assume a parallel shift of all foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar; however, 
 foreign currency exchange rates do not typically move in such a manner, and actual results may differ materially. 
 Our exposure to market risk elements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with the risk elements 
 presented above, including the effects of changes in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had performed an evaluation, under the supervision of our principal executive officers and 
 principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. These controls and 
 procedures have been designed to ensure that information required for disclosure is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported 
 within the requisite time periods. Based on our evaluation, the principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that 
 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In 2006, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC, a subsidiary of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., was granted an option to 
 incorporate a land parcel adjacent to and north of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City ACLS-NYC campus 
 Option Parcel into the existing ground lease of that campus. The Option Parcel will allow ARE-East River Science Park, LLC to 
 develop a future world-class life science building within the ACLS-NYC campus. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC s investment in pre- 
 construction costs related to the development of the Option Parcel, including costs related to design, engineering, environmental, 
 survey/title, and permitting and legal costs, aggregate million as of September 30, 2024 . 
 On August 6, 2024, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern 
 District of New York against its landlord, New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation H+H ), and the New York City Economic 
 Development Corporation EDC ). The lawsuit alleges two principal claims against H+H and EDC: fraud in the inducement, and, in the 
 alternative, breach of contract in violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As alleged in the complaint, ARE-East 
 River Science Park, LLC s claims arise from H+H s and EDC s misrepresentations and concealment of material facts in connection with 
 a floodwall, which H+H and EDC are seeking to require ARE-East River Science Park, LLC to integrate into the development of the 
 Option Parcel. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC alleges that H+H s and EDC s misconduct have prevented it from commencing the 
 development of the Option Parcel. In light of the pending litigation, the closing date for the option and thus the commencement date for 
 construction of the third tower at the campus are presently indeterminate. Among other things, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC is 
 seeking significant damages and equitable relief to maintain the option. 
 This matter exposes us to potential losses ranging from zero to the full amount of the investment in the project aggregating 
 million as of September 30, 2024 , depending on any collection of damages and/or the ability to develop the project. We 
 performed a probability-weighted recoverability analysis based on initial estimates of various possible outcomes and determined no 
 impairment was present as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q , one should also carefully review and consider the 
 information contained in the other reports and periodic filings that we make with the SEC, including, without limitation, the information 
 contained under the caption Item 1A. Risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Those 
 risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risks that we describe in our public 
 filings are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we presently deem to be 
 immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed under the caption Item 1A. Risk factors in our 
 annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , except for the following updates: 
 The increased use of artificial intelligence AI and automation in life science research and development 
 R D activities may change the uses, space configurations and tenant requirements for our laboratory properties 
 in currently unforeseen ways. 
 In recent years, some life science companies have augmented their traditional laboratory-based R D efforts by 
 integrating AI, cloud computing, quantum computing and other advanced computational technologies into their R D programs. 
 It is expected that such technologies will accelerate and streamline a number of R D functions, including, for example, through 
 the targeted design and evaluation of clinical trials and the efficient identification of the most promising drug development 
 candidates from among multiple possible drugs. In addition, life science companies, like companies in many other industries, 
 are increasingly integrating new technologies, such as robotics and advanced automation of recurring tasks, into their 
 businesses, including their R D activities. It is widely thought that the life science and healthcare industries, like most 
 industries, are in only the early stages of an advanced technology revolution that may have profound, and largely currently 
 unknown, impacts on their businesses, including the processes and strategies underlying R D and commercialization of new 
 products. 
 We have always strived to provide our tenants with state-of-the-art laboratory facilities incorporating cutting-edge 
 infrastructure features (including energy delivery, environmental, sustainability, security, and waste disposal features) to enable 
 our tenants to perform at the highest levels. It is currently unknown how the ongoing adoption of advanced technologies and 
 automation in the life science industry will impact the optimal space configurations and infrastructure features of the laboratory 
 of the future, and we may face new tenant requirements and requests that will require significant expenditures that may not be 
 entirely recoverable through increased rents. For example, the adoption of AI by our tenants may lead to infrastructure 
 requirements that our buildings currently do not accommodate, such as increased power needs due to high-performance 
 computing. Infrastructure upgrades may necessitate substantial capital expenditures and could potentially impact the 
 environmental footprint of our building operations. 

116 

If technological developments result in a reduction or reconfiguration in space requirements by our tenants, demand by 
 individual tenants and prospective tenants for space may decrease over time. If we are not able to offset any reduction in demand from 
 the foregoing developments through repurposing space, property dispositions, or other means, the realization of any of the 
 aforementioned risks could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, net operating income, results of operations, funds from 
 operations, operating margins, occupancy, earnings per share, FFO per share, our overall business, and the market value of our 
 common stock. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Disclosure of 10b5-1 plans 
 of our officers or directors had any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was 
 intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement in effect at any 
 time during the three months ended September 30, 2024 .

 (vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii) , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing of Floating Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily RFR Loans, prior to 12 00 Noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily RFR Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Committed Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (i) Payments by Borrower Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment and without relieving the Borrower s obligation to make such payment, then each of the Lenders or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans (including Revolving Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies in the event they are Alternative Currency Funding Lenders), to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) and to fund Alternative Currency Risk Participations (if they are Alternative Currency Participating Lenders) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan (including Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency in the event it is an Alternative Currency Funding Lender), to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan (including Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency in the event it is an Alternative Currency Funding Lender), to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) . 
 (e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 2.12 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that 
 (a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and 
 (b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of a Credit Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.16 , or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
 Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Credit Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation.

If the Borrower becomes aware of any Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and, in connection therewith, if a proper calculation of the Sustainability Margin Adjustment, the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment or the Sustainability Metric Percentage would 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024)

 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

any Lender or any L C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to such Credit Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Credit Party under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses (including Taxes) and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such indemnified party plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L C Issuer be required to pay any amount to any Credit Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

 3.02 Illegality . If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Floating Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or Daily RFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Floating Rate or the Daily RFR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender (a) to make or continue Floating Rate Loans or Daily RFR Loans in the affected currency or currencies, (b) in the case of Floating Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans or Daily RFR Loans to Floating Rate Committed Loans and (c) in the case of Daily RFR Loans, to convert Base Rate Loans or Floating Rate Loans in Dollars to Daily RFR Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Floating Rate Loans and or Daily RFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), in the case of Floating Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Floating Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Floating Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Floating Rate, the Administrative Agent shall 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Floating Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Any Lender that is or becomes an Alternative Currency Participating Lender with respect to any Alternative Currency pursuant to this Section 3.02 or otherwise as provided in this Agreement shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in the event that the impediment resulting in its being or becoming an Alternative Currency Participating Lender is alleviated in a manner such that it can become an Alternative Currency Funding Lender with respect to such Alternative Currency. 
 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates . If in connection with any request for a Floating Rate Loan or a Daily RFR Loan, a conversion to a Floating Rate Loan or a Daily RFR Loan or continuation of a Floating Rate Loan (a) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine in good faith that for any reason that (i) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Floating Rate Loan or the applicable term with respect to any Daily RFR Loan or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Floating Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Floating Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing proposed Base Rate Loan or the Daily RFR Rate with respect to a proposed Daily RFR Loan (in each case with respect to clause (a)(i) above, Impacted Loans and the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders, as the case may be, reasonably expect that the situation described in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, will be temporary and the circumstances described in Section 3.07 do not apply, or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine in good faith that for any reason the Floating Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Floating Rate Loan or the Daily RFR Rate with respect to a proposed Daily RFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Floating Rate Loan or Daily RFR Loan, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Floating Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies and or make or maintain Daily RFR Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Floating Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Floating Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or a Borrowing of, or conversion to, Daily RFR Loans, as applicable, or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders has made a determination described in clause (a)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (x) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) of this Section, (y) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (z) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.

 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, which such Lender deems material in its reasonable discretion, of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Floating Rate or the Daily RFR Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L C Issuer in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any L C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or such L C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity ratios or requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such L C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such L C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L C Issuer or such Lender s or such L C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such L C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such L C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material in its reasonable discretion, then upon request of such Lender or L C Issuer from time to time in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L C Issuer or such Lender s or such L C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender or an L C Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such L C Issuer s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L C Issuer pursuant to the provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than three months prior to the date that such Lender or such L C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such L C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 (e) Reserves on Floating Rate Loans and Daily RFR Loans . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities ), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Floating Rate Loan and or Daily RFR Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Floating Rate Loans and or Daily RFR Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which in each case, shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan provided , the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice. Any Lender which gives notice under this Section 3.04(e) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) in the event such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease to exist. 
 Any amounts requested to be payable pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall be requested in good faith (and not on an arbitrary and capricious basis), and, notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 3.04 , the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any greater amounts than such Lender(s) or such L C Issuer is (are) generally charging other borrowers or account parties on loans or letters of credit (as the case may be) similarly situated to the Borrower that are parties to similar credit agreements provided that in no event shall any Lender or L C Issuer be required to disclose information of other customers. 
 3.05 Compensation for Losses . Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of 
 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Floating Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Floating Rate Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise) 
 (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert to any Floating Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

(c) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency 
 (d) any assignment of a Floating Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13 or 
 (e) any change in the applicable Spot Rate between the date of funding of an Alternative Currency Risk Participation pursuant to Section 2.02(f)(iii) and the date of repayment by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02(f)(vi) 
 including any loss or expense (including, without limitation, any foreign exchange losses) arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits). The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
 For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05 , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Floating Rate Committed Loan made by it at the Floating Rate used in determining the Floating Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank eurodollar market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Floating Rate Committed Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation for such amounts, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any prepayment of a Floating Rate Loan made hereunder pursuant to Section 2.05(c) or (e) within 30 days of the end of the Interest Period with respect to such Floating Rate Loan, shall not be subject to this Section 3.05 . 
 3.06 Mitigation Obligations Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

 ARTICLE XI. GUARANTY 
 11.01 The Guaranty . Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to each Lender, each L C Issuer, the Sustainability Structuring Agent and each other holder of the Obligations as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. 
 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents or the other documents relating to the Obligations, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under applicable Debtor Relief Laws. 
 11.02 Obligations Unconditional . The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 11.01 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Obligations, or any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than payment in full of the Obligations), it being the intent of this Section 11.02 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Article XI until such time as the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) have been paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above 
 (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived 
 (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Obligations shall be done or omitted 
 (c) the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Loan Documents or other documents relating to the Obligations shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with 
 (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations as security for any of the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected or 
 (e) any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor). 
 With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives, to the extent permitted by Law, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, acceptance hereof, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Loan Documents or any other document relating to the Obligations, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations. 
 11.03 Reinstatement . The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article XI shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT (2024) 

respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each other holder of the Obligations on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such other holder of the Obligations in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any Debtor Relief Law. 
 11.04 Certain Additional Waivers . Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 11.02 and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 11.06 . 
 11.05 Remedies . The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other holders of the Obligations, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as specified in Section 8.02 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances specified in Section 8.02 for purposes of Section 11.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 11.01 . 
 11.06 Rights of Contribution . The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under applicable Laws. Such contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of such Guarantors under the Loan Documents and no Guarantor shall exercise such rights of contribution until all Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have terminated. 
 11.07 Guarantee of Payment Continuing Guarantee . The guarantee in this Article XI is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising. 
 11.08 Additional Guarantors . The Borrower may at any time and from time to time, upon written request to the Administrative Agent, cause a Domestic Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary to become a Guarantor under this Agreement by (a) executing a Joinder Agreement and (b) delivering such other documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection therewith, including, without limitation, certified resolutions and other organizational and customary authorizing documents of such Person, all in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
