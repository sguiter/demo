 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, including warrants, and from borrowings under term loan facilities. To date, none of the Company s product candidates have been approved for sale, and the Company has not generated any revenue from commercial products. The Company expects operating losses to continue and increase for the foreseeable future as the Company progresses its clinical development activities for its product candidates. The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the date of the issuance of these financial statements.

The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value for the security is estimated under the market or income approach using pricing models with market observable inputs. 

After one year through two years 

Total cash equivalents and marketable securities 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s marketable securities in an unrealized loss position include primarily fixed-rate debt securities of varying maturities, which are sensitive to changes in the yield curve and other market conditions. All of the fixed-rate debt securities in a loss position are investment-grade debt securities. The Company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until recovery of the unrealized losses. Based on the Company s assessment, the unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 were 

 9 

shares of the Company s common stock issued in connection with the Term Loan (See Note 6). The number of warrants that become exercisable is contingent on subsequent loan advances by the Company under the Term Loan facility. As such, the warrants are not considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock and were accounted for as a liability. The Company recorded the fair value of the warrants upon issuance using a probability-weighted scenario analysis with a Black-Scholes valuation model and is required to revalue the warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss until the exercise contingencies are resolved. The valuation of the warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, taking into account the likelihood of the warrants becoming exercisable and the fair value of the underlying common stock of the Company. The warrants had a fair value of million as of the issuance date and September 30, 2024, based on a Black-Scholes valuation with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of , dividends, expected volatility of and expected term of years.

million. Under each license agreement, the Company is required to pay Teva million upon the achievement of a specified clinical development milestone, and additional payments totaling up to million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. Each milestone payment shall be payable once, upon the first occurrence of the applicable milestone. The Company is also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales on all products containing the Teva compounds. The Teva Agreements can be terminated (i) by the Company without cause upon days written notice to Teva, (ii) by either party, if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the Teva Agreements and fails to cure such breach within days after receiving notice thereof, or (iii) by either party, if a bankruptcy petition is filed against the other party and is not dismissed

days. In addition, Teva can also terminate the agreement related to their glycoPEGylated FGF21 program in the event the Company, or any of its affiliates or sublicensees, challenges any of the Teva patents licensed to the Company, and the challenge is not withdrawn within 30 days of written notice from Teva. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made a million milestone payment to Teva following the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the FGF21 program in SHTG. As of September 30, 2024, the timing and likelihood of achieving any remaining milestones are uncertain. Milestone payment obligations will be recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the applicable milestone. BiBo Collaboration Agreement On , the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the Collaboration Agreement with BiBo Biopharma Engineering Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the People s Republic of China BiBo ), pursuant to which BiBo will construct a production facility specifically designed to supply the Company with pegozafermin for commercialization, if approved (the Production Facility ). Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the bulk active ingredient (the Drug Substance required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide the Company with manufacturing capacity to meet its commercial needs. Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company is required to pay BiBo an aggregate of million (exclusive of applicable value-added tax) toward the construction of the Production Facility (collectively, the Payment ), of which million (net of applicable value-added tax) in milestone payments were paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded in Research and Development in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The remainder of the Payment will become payable upon achievement of certain specified milestones, of which up to an additional million of the Payment could become payable by the end of 2024. If the actual costs of the Production Facility are substantially greater than the estimated budget, the parties will negotiate a means of allocating such cost overruns. 

 million, consisting of up to four separate delayed-draw term loans Initial Term Loan ). Upon execution of the agreement, the Company drew million pursuant to the Existing Loan Agreement. An additional million expired undrawn and million available at the Lenders discretion lapsed upon refinancing of the debt (discussed below). Additionally, the Lenders may elect to convert up to an aggregate of million of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loan then outstanding into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share. Notwithstanding the debt refinancing transaction, this conversion right remains outstanding under the Loan Agreement (as defined below). The Initial Term Loan bore interest equal to the greater of (i) and (ii) the sum of (a) the Prime Rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus (b) and provided for interest-only payments through February 1, 2025. Upon prepayment or maturity, the Company was required to pay an end of term fee equal to of the aggregate principal amount of term loans advanced. In connection with the debt refinancing transaction, the Lenders agreed to defer the payment of the existing end of term fee of million to its originally scheduled maturity date of . In connection with the advance of the Initial Term Loan, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, which remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The warrants became exercisable from the date of issuance and have a term of s with an exercise price of per share of common stock. The Company also issued to the Lenders warrants to purchase shares of common stock that were contingently exercisable upon funding of delayed-draw term loans. These contingently exercisable warrants were either forfeited upon expiration of the respective delayed-draw period or cancelled in connection with the debt refinancing transaction. Amended Loan Agreement I n September 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Existing Loan Agreement (the Amendment and the Existing Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, the Loan Agreement increasing the maximum aggregate principal amount in delayed-draw term loans to million (the Term Loan from million. The Loan Agreement consists of (i) a first tranche of million, of which million was funded at closing (including the refinancing of the existing million principal balance outstanding) and of which an additional million is available through June 30, 2025, (ii) a second tranche of million available to be funded upon the achievement of a specific clinical development milestone through December 31, 2025, and (iii) a third tranche of up to million upon the Company s request, subject to review by the Lenders of certain information from the Company and discretionary approval by the Lenders.

times the average change in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities measured over the trailing three-month period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement. and provide for interest-only payments until January 1, 2027, which can be extended to January 1, 2028 upon achievement of a clinical milestone. Consecutive equal payments of principal and interest are due once the interest-only period has lapsed. The Term Loan bears interest equal to the greater of (i) and (ii) the sum of (a) the Prime Rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus (b) . On the date the debt was refinanced and on September 30, 2024, the stated interest rate on the outstanding Term Loan was . An end of term fee of of the aggregate principal amount of term loans advanced is also payable. The Company has the option to prepay the entire outstanding balance of borrowings under the Loan Agreement, subject to a prepayment fee ranging from to depending on the timing of such prepayment. In connection with the Amendment, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share that expire from the date of issuance. Of the shares underlying the warrants issued, shares were immediately exercisable upon the advance of million at closing (including the refinancing of the existing million principal balance outstanding) and met the criteria for equity classification. The remaining shares become exercisable in proportion to future advances of term loans and were liability classified and subject to remeasurement at each reporting period (see Note 3). In addition to the conversion right carried over from the Initial Term Loan, the Lenders may elect to convert up to an additional aggregate of million of the principal amount of the Term Loan then outstanding into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share. The Company evaluated the debt refinancing to determine if it was an extinguishment or a modification of the debt. Due to the addition of a substantive conversion feature (it is reasonably possible that the conversion feature may be exercised and affect the manner of the debt instrument s settlement), the Company determined that the refinancing was an extinguishment of debt. The Company measured the loss on extinguishment of debt based on the difference between the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt and the reacquisition price of the new debt, which included million for amendment fees paid to the lender. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of million as a component of Interest Expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company assessed the embedded conversion feature and concluded that bifurcation and separate accounting as a derivative liability were not required because the feature is indexed to the Company s own stock and meets the criteria for equity classification. The immediately exercisable warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock issued to the Lenders had a fair value of million and was recorded as debt discount with a corresponding entry to additional paid-in capital. The contingently exercisable warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock had a fair value of million at issuance and was recorded as deferred debt issuance costs within other current assets with a corresponding entry to warrant liability (see Note 3). The deferred debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over the respective delayed-draw term loan commitment periods under the Loan Agreement.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our lead product candidate, pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 FGF21 ), is currently being developed for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis MASH ), previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia SHTG ). 
 MASH is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In 2020 and 2022, we presented positive topline results from our Phase 1b/2a trial of pegozafermin in MASH patients, which have informed the advancement of our subsequent clinical strategy in MASH. In our Phase 2b ENLIVEN trial of pegozafermin in MASH patients, patients received weekly doses or an every-two-week dose of pegozafermin or placebo for 24 weeks followed by a blinded extension phase of an additional 24 weeks for a total treatment period of 48 weeks. We reported topline 24-week data from ENLIVEN in March 2023. The 44 mg every-two-week and the 30 mg weekly dose groups both met, with high statistical significance, both of the primary histology endpoints per the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA guidance definitions on endpoints for accelerated approval in non-cirrhotic MASH patients. In September 2023, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pegozafermin in patients with MASH. In addition, in March 2024, the EMA granted Priority Medicines PRIME designation to pegozafermin in patients with MASH, based on clinical data from the Phase 2b ENLIVEN trial. In November 2023, we announced positive topline data from the blinded extension phase of our Phase 2b ENLIVEN trial at 48 weeks. Both the 44 mg every-two-week and 30 mg weekly dose groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements across Non-Invasive Tests NITs representing key markers of liver health. The benefits observed at week 48 represented by NITs were consistent with the histology and NITs results observed at week 24, indicating sustained benefits over time. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we held successful end-of-Phase 2 meetings with the FDA, supporting the advancement of pegozafermin into a Phase 3 program and future biologics license application BLA filing. We received scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency EMA ), which generally aligned with the feedback from the FDA. 
 The Phase 3 ENLIGHTEN program includes two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating patients with MASH: (i) ENLIGHTEN-Fibrosis, in patients with fibrosis stage F2-F3 (F2-F3), which we initiated in the first quarter of 2024 and (ii) ENLIGHTEN-Cirrhosis, in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4), which we initiated in the second quarter of 2024. 
 We are also developing pegozafermin for the treatment of SHTG. In June 2022, we announced positive topline results from the ENTRIGUE Phase 2 trial of pegozafermin in SHTG patients. SHTG is a condition identified by severely elevated levels of triglycerides 500 mg/dL), which is associated with an increased risk of MASH, cardiovascular events and acute pancreatitis. The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides from baseline and key secondary endpoints. We received feedback from the FDA supporting the advancement of pegozafermin and initiated our Phase 3 ENTRUST trial, the first of two recommended Phase 3 trials, in the second quarter of 2023. We expect to report topline results from our Phase 3 ENTRUST trial in 2025. Safety data from the ongoing SHTG Phase 3 program is expected to support the safety database requirements for MASH and vice versa. 
 In April 2024, we entered into a collaboration agreement (the Collaboration Agreement with BiBo Biopharma Engineering Co., Ltd., pursuant to which BiBo will construct a production facility specifically designed to supply us with pegozafermin for commercialization, if approved (the Production Facility ). Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the bulk active ingredient (the Drug Substance required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide us with manufacturing capacity to meet our commercial needs. 
 16 

We commenced operations in 2018 and have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, acquiring our initial product candidate, identifying and developing pegozafermin, licensing certain related technology, conducting research and development activities (including preclinical studies and clinical trials) and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We currently have contractual relationships with Northway Biotechpharma BTPH and BiBo pursuant to which they supply us with pegozafermin for our clinical trials. 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 248.7 million and 102.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 706.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses as we advance pegozafermin and any future product candidates through clinical trials, seek regulatory approval for pegozafermin and any future product candidates, expand our clinical, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities, protect our intellectual property, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of pegozafermin and any future product candidates, expand our general and administrative support functions, including hiring additional personnel, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 423.8 million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least one year from the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our lead product candidate, pegozafermin. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs related to preclinical and clinical development, including costs related to acquiring patents and intellectual property, expenses incurred under license agreements and agreements with contract research organizations and consultants, costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, including under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors, costs related to the preparation of regulatory submissions and expenses related to laboratory supplies and services, as well as personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for individuals involved in research and development efforts. 
 We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as services are provided based on invoices and statements received from our external service providers and by monitoring the status of their activities. We adjust our accrued expenses as actual costs become known. 
 Payments associated with licensing agreements to acquire licenses to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternate commercial use are expensed as incurred. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements or license agreements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the milestone. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of pegozafermin and continue to invest in research and development activities. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of pegozafermin and any future product candidates is highly uncertain. To the extent that pegozafermin continues to advance into larger and later stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. The actual probability of success for pegozafermin or any future product candidate may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, investment in our clinical programs, manufacturing capability and competition with other products. As a result, we are unable to determine the timing of initiation, duration and completion costs of our research and development efforts or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of pegozafermin or any future product candidate. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resource, audit and accounting services, consulting costs and allocated facilities costs. Personnel and related costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and other administrative functions. Facilities costs consist of rent and maintenance of facilities. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business and support our continued research and development activities. 
 17 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense, accretion of final payment fees and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our term loan facility, and loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Interest Income and Other, Net 
 Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest income including accretion of discount on marketable securities, offset by amortization of premium on marketable securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 423.8 million and an accumulated deficit of 706.2 million. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 At-the-Market ATM Offerings 
 In March 2021, we entered into an ATM sales agreement (as amended, the Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. (the Sales Agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 75.0 million of shares of our common stock (the 2021 ATM Facility from time to time pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Sales Agents are entitled to compensation at a commission of up to 3.0 of the aggregate gross sales price per share sold under the Sales Agreement. In February 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Sales Agreement, establishing a new ATM facility with an aggregate offering amount of up to 150.0 million of shares of our common stock (the 2023 ATM Facility pursuant to an effective registration statement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 2,168,539 shares of our common stock under our 2021 ATM Facility and 2023 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of 37.1 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,396,888 shares of our common stock under the 2023 ATM Facility resulting in net proceeds of 21.0 million. However, there were no sales under the 2023 ATM Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was 104.4 million remaining for future sales under the 2023 ATM Facility. 
 Underwritten Public Offerings 
 In March 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and raised net proceeds of 296.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 19.0 million and other offering costs of 0.5 million. 
 In December 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of 161.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 10.4 million and other offering costs of 0.4 million. 
 Exercises of Common Stock Warrants 
 Warrants to purchase 2,927,570 shares of common stock were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, generating 15.6 million in cash proceeds. 
 Warrants to purchase 10,179,789 shares of common stock were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, generating 54.2 million in cash proceeds. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Existing Loan Agreement with the lender parties thereto (the Lenders ), K2 HealthVentures LLC as administrative agent and Ankura Trust Company, LLC as collateral agent. The Existing Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility with a maximum aggregate principal of 100.0 million, consisting of up to four separate delayed-draw term loans Initial Term Loan ). Upon execution of the agreement, we drew 25.0 million pursuant to the Existing Loan Agreement. An additional 25.0 million expired undrawn and 50.0 million available at the Lenders discretion lapsed upon refinancing of the debt (discussed below). 
 In September 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Existing Loan Agreement (the Amendment and the Existing Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, the Loan Agreement increasing the maximum aggregate principal amount in delayed-draw term loans to 150.0 million (the Term Loan from 100.0 million. The Loan Agreement consists of (i) a first tranche of 70.0 million, of which 35.0 million was funded at closing (including the refinancing of the existing 25.0 million principal balance outstanding) and of which an additional 35.0 million is available through June 30, 2025, (ii) a second tranche of 30.0 million available to be funded upon the achievement of a specific clinical development milestone through December 31, 2025, and (iii) a third tranche of up to 50.0 million upon our request, subject to review by the Lenders of certain information from us and discretionary approval by the Lenders. 
 20 

Funding Requirements 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures related to our lead product candidate, pegozafermin, as well as the funding of a portion of the construction of the Production Facility. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical development of our current and future product candidates. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical development, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs we will incur and the timelines that will be required to complete development, obtain marketing approval, and commercialize our current product candidate or any future product candidates. For the same reasons, we are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from product sales or our current or any future license agreements which we may enter into or whether, or when, if ever, we may achieve profitability. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast the timing and amounts of milestone, royalty and other revenue from licensing activities, which future product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 423.8 million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least one year from the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. However, our operating plans and other demands on our cash resources may change as a result of many factors, and we may seek additional funds sooner than planned. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the progress, timing, scope, results and costs of our clinical trials of pegozafermin and preclinical studies or clinical trials of other potential product candidates we may choose to pursue in the future, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for our clinical trials; 

the costs and timing of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies and validating the commercial manufacturing process for pegozafermin and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; 

the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals; 

the timing and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments we are required to make pursuant to current or any future collaboration or license agreements; 

costs of acquiring or in-licensing other product candidates and technologies; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the costs associated with attracting, hiring and retaining additional qualified personnel as our business grows; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; and 

the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 

We expect to continue to generate substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development activities. We will continue to fund our operations primarily through utilization of our current financial resources and through additional raises of capital to advance our current product candidate through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. However, there is no assurance that such funding will be available to us or that it will be obtained on terms favorable to us or will provide us with sufficient funds to meet our objectives. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. 
 To the extent that we raise additional capital through partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our then-existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our clinical trials or preclinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of 246.2 million reflects a net loss of 248.7 million and a net change of 7.6 million in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate noncash charges of 10.1 million. The net loss was driven by milestone payments of 81.0 million (net of applicable value-added tax) made to our contract manufacturing partner, BiBo, under the Collaboration Agreement to secure manufacturing capacity to produce pegozafermin for our commercial needs. Noncash charges primarily included stock-based compensation expense of 15.4 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.5 million related to the refinancing of a term loan, noncash operating lease expense of 0.5 million and amortization of debt discount and accretion of deferred debt costs of 0.5 million, offset in part by net accretion of discounts on investments in marketable securities of 7.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 7.6 million and was primarily due to an increase in prepaid and other assets of 17.2 million as we made prepayments related to the initiation of two Phase 3 clinical trials, ENLIGHTEN-Fibrosis and ENLIGHTEN-Cirrhosis, partially offset by a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 9.8 million driven by timing of payments made and an increase in services rendered by contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations in connection with the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of 94.9 million reflects a net loss of 102.0 million and a net change of 2.8 million in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate noncash charges of 9.8 million. Noncash charges primarily included stock-based compensation expense of 12.1 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.2 million related to the repayment of a term loan, amortization of debt discount and accretion of the final payment fee related to our term loan facility of 0.7 million, offset in part by net accretion of discounts on investments in marketable securities of 4.3 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a 3.2 million increase in prepaid and other assets due to higher contract manufacturing costs related to manufacturing and scale-up related spend, partially offset by a net increase of 0.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 60.7 million, which consisted of 313.1 million in purchases of marketable securities, offset by 252.4 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 59.4 million, which consisted of 216.8 million in purchases of marketable securities, offset by 157.4 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 82.2 million, which primarily consisted of proceeds of 54.2 million from the exercise of common stock warrants, net proceeds of 21.0 million pursuant to the sale of our common stock under our 2023 ATM Facility, and net proceeds of 9.3 million from borrowings under the Loan Agreement. This was offset in part by payments for employee withholding taxes of 2.6 million related to net share settlement upon vesting of restricted stock units. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 350.9 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of 296.8 million from the sale of common stock in public offerings, net proceeds of 37.1 million pursuant to the sale of common stock under our 2021 ATM Facility and 2023 ATM Facility, net proceeds of 24.4 million from borrowings under the Existing Loan Agreement, and proceeds of 15.6 million from the exercise of common stock warrants. This was offset in part by the repayment in full of 21.4 million on a term loan, including prepayment and end of term fees and payments for employee withholding taxes of 2.3 million related to net share settlement upon vesting of restricted stock units.

 In April 2018, we concurrently entered into two Asset Transfer and License Agreements (the Teva Agreements with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Teva under which we acquired certain patents and intellectual property relating to two programs: (1) Teva s glycoPEGylated FGF21 program including the compound TEV-47948 (pegozafermin), a glycoPEGylated long-acting FGF21 and (2) Teva s development program of small molecule inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase, under which we did not develop product candidates, and all rights associated with the program are being returned to Teva. Pursuant to the Teva Agreements, we paid Teva an initial nonrefundable upfront payment of 6.0 million. Under each license agreement, we are required to pay Teva 2.5 million upon the achievement of a specified clinical development milestone, and additional payments totaling up to 65.0 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. Each milestone payment shall be payable once, upon the first occurrence of the applicable milestone. We are also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales on all products containing the Teva compounds. 
 The Teva Agreements can be terminated (i) by us without cause upon 120 days written notice to Teva, (ii) by either party, if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the Teva Agreements and fails to cure such breach within 60 days after receiving notice thereof, or (iii) by either party, if a bankruptcy petition is filed against the other party and is not dismissed within 60 days. In addition, Teva can also terminate the agreement related to their glycoPEGylated FGF21 program in the event we, or any of our affiliates or sublicensees, challenges any of the Teva patents licensed to us, and the challenge is not withdrawn within 30 days of written notice from Teva. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made a 2.5 million milestone payment to Teva following the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the FGF21 program in SHTG. As of September 30, 2024, the timing and likelihood of achieving any remaining milestones are uncertain. Milestone payment obligations will be recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the applicable milestone. 
 Production Facility Funding Commitments 
 On April 4, 2024, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the Drug Substance required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide us with manufacturing capacity to meet our commercial needs. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are required to pay BiBo an aggregate of 135.0 million (exclusive of applicable value-added tax) toward the construction of the Production Facility (collectively, the Payment ), of which 81.0 million (net of applicable value-added tax) in milestone payments were paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded in Research and Development in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The remainder of the Payment will become payable upon achievement of certain specified milestones, of which up to an additional 40.5 million of the Payment could become payable by the end of 2024. If the actual costs of the Production Facility are substantially greater than the estimated budget, the parties will negotiate a means of allocating such cost overruns.

Item 4. Co ntrols and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to make an investment decision with respect to shares of our common stock. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In any such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. We caution you that the risks, uncertainties and other factors referred to below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our future results and operations. Moreover, new risks will emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks. 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 Investing in our common stock involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Below is a summary of some of the risks we face. 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred net losses since our inception, we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses and we may never be profitable. Our stock is a highly speculative investment. 

Our business depends on the success of pegozafermin, our only product candidate under clinical development, which has not completed a pivotal trial. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize pegozafermin or other future product candidates, or we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 

Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes, and the results of prior preclinical or clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of our future results. 

We will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may not complete the development and commercialization of pegozafermin or develop new product candidates. 

If we experience delays in clinical testing, our commercial prospects will be adversely affected, our costs may increase and our business may be harmed. 

If we encounter difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 

We have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers and vendors to produce and release pegozafermin or any future product candidates. Any failure by a third-party to produce and release acceptable product candidates for us pursuant to our specifications and regulatory standards may delay or impair our ability to initiate or complete our clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals or commercialize approved products. 

Pegozafermin and any future product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of an approved label. 

We are developing pegozafermin for the treatment of MASH and the treatment of SHTG. The requirements for approval of pegozafermin by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may be difficult to predict and may change over time, which makes it difficult to predict the timing and costs of the clinical development. 

25 

Lack of efficacy, adverse events or undesirable side effects may emerge in clinical trials conducted by third parties developing FGF product candidates, which could adversely affect our stock price, our ability to attract additional capital and our development program. 

Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 

The manufacture of biologic products is complex and we are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products. 

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do. 

Unstable market and economic conditions, inflation, fluctuations in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine and Israel, or other macroeconomic conditions, may have serious adverse consequences on our business and financial condition. 

Our Loan Agreement contains certain covenants that could adversely affect our operations and, if an event of default were to occur, we could be forced to repay any outstanding indebtedness sooner than planned and possibly at a time when we do not have sufficient capital to meet this obligation. 

Pegozafermin has not received regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market pegozafermin or any future product candidates, our business will be adversely affected. 

Our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies. 

We rely on a license from Teva and a sublicense from ratiopharm to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology that are used in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pegozafermin. Any termination or loss of significant rights, including the right to glycoPEGylation technology, or breach, under these agreements or any future license agreement related to our product candidates, would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue the development and commercialization of the related product candidates. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred net losses since our inception, we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses and we may never be profitable. Our stock is a highly speculative investment. 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history that may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. We commenced operations in 2018, and to date, our operations have been focused on organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, acquiring our initial product candidate, pegozafermin and licensing certain related technology, conducting research and development activities, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect and/or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale, we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have limited experience as a company conducting clinical trials and no experience as a company commercializing any products. 
 Pegozafermin is in development and, to date, we have not generated any revenue from the licensing or commercialization of pegozafermin. We will not be able to generate product revenue unless and until pegozafermin or any future product candidate, alone or with future partners, successfully completes clinical trials, receives regulatory approval and is successfully commercialized. As pegozafermin is in development, we do not expect to receive revenue from it for a number of years, if ever. Although we may seek to obtain revenue from collaboration or licensing agreements with third parties, we currently have no such agreements that could provide us with material, ongoing future revenue and we may never enter into any such agreements. 
 We are not profitable and have incurred net losses since our inception. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, pegozafermin and any future product candidates. We expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as our research and development, clinical trials and manufacturing activities increase. In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including that our product candidates may not advance or may take longer than expected to advance through development or may not achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or if or when 
 26 

we will achieve or maintain profitability. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. Even if we eventually generate product revenue, we may never be profitable and, if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 
 Our business depends on the success of pegozafermin, our only product candidate under clinical development, which has not completed a pivotal trial. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize pegozafermin or other future product candidates, or we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 
 The primary focus of our product development is pegozafermin for the treatment of patients with MASH and the treatment of patients with SHTG. Currently, pegozafermin is our only product candidate under clinical development. This may make an investment in our company riskier than similar companies that have multiple product candidates in active development and that therefore may be able to better sustain a failure of a lead candidate. Successful continued development and ultimate regulatory approval of pegozafermin for the treatment of MASH or SHTG is critical to the future success of our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the clinical development of pegozafermin. If we cannot successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize pegozafermin, we may not be able to continue our operations. The future regulatory and commercial success of pegozafermin is subject to a number of risks, including that, if approved for MASH or SHTG, pegozafermin will likely compete with products that may reach approval for the treatment of MASH prior to pegozafermin, products that are currently approved for the treatment of SHTG and the off-label use of currently marketed products for MASH and SHTG. 
 Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and uncertain outcomes, and the results of prior preclinical or clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of our future results. 
 Pegozafermin and any future product candidates will be subject to rigorous and extensive clinical trials and extensive regulatory approval processes implemented by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities before obtaining marketing approval from these regulatory authorities. The drug development and approval process is lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Investigational new drugs, such as pegozafermin, may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials. We have limited direct experience as a company in conducting pivotal trials required to obtain regulatory approval and we expect that the Phase 3 trials we are conducting will be more expansive and complex than the trials we have conducted to date. We may be unable to conduct clinical trials at preferred sites, enlist clinical investigators, enroll sufficient numbers of participants, procure sufficient drug supply or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. Even if an ongoing clinical trial is successful, it may be insufficient to demonstrate that pegozafermin is safe or effective for registration purposes. 
 There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of pegozafermin or any future product candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies or trials and the results of studies or trials in one set of patients or line of treatment may not be predictive of those obtained in another. In fact, many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical studies and earlier stage clinical trials. In addition, data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. It is impossible to predict when or if pegozafermin or any future product candidate will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Owing in part to the complexity of biological pathways, pegozafermin or any future product candidate may not demonstrate in patients the biochemical and pharmacological properties we anticipate based on laboratory studies or earlier stage clinical trials, and they may interact with human biological systems or other drugs in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. The number of patients exposed to product candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development programs may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events or findings that may only be detected once a product candidate is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time. To date, our Phase 1a, Phase 1b/2a and Phase 2 clinical trials have involved small patient populations and, because of the small sample size in such trials, the results of those clinical trials may be subject to substantial variability, including the inherent variability associated with biopsies in MASH patients, and may not be indicative of either future interim results or final results in future trials of patients with liver or cardio-metabolic diseases. If we are unable to successfully demonstrate the safety and efficacy of pegozafermin or other future product candidates and receive the necessary regulatory approvals, our business will be materially harmed. 
 We will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may not complete the development and commercialization of pegozafermin or develop new product candidates. 
 As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, our operations have consumed significant amounts of cash since our inception. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct Phase 3 clinical trials of, seek regulatory approval for pegozafermin and prepare for commercialization of pegozafermin. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for a period of at least one year from the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. 
 We will require additional capital to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize pegozafermin and any future product candidates. Our ability to complete new and ongoing clinical trials for pegozafermin may be subject to our ability to raise additional capital. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than as a result of any sales that we may make 
 27 

pursuant to the Sales Agreement for our 2023 ATM Facility and proceeds from our Loan Agreement, which are subject to the achievement of certain milestones and/or consent of the lenders. We may also receive additional funds from the exercise of outstanding warrants. We expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings or product collaborations. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all. The current market environment for small biotechnology companies, like 89bio, and broader macroeconomic factors may preclude us from successfully raising additional capital. 
 If we do not raise additional capital, we may not be able to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and we may need to: significantly delay, scale back or discontinue research and discovery efforts and the development or commercialization of any product candidates or cease operations altogether; seek strategic alliances for research and development programs when we otherwise would not, or at an earlier stage than we would otherwise desire or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or relinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. 
 In addition, if pegozafermin receives approval and is commercialized, we will be required to make milestone and royalty payments to Teva, from whom we acquired certain patents and intellectual property rights relating to pegozafermin, and from whom we licensed patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology that is used in the manufacture of pegozafermin. For additional information regarding this license agreement, please see Note 5 to accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 If we experience delays in clinical testing, our commercial prospects will be adversely affected, our costs may increase and our business may be harmed. 
 We cannot guarantee that we will be able to initiate and complete clinical trials and successfully accomplish all required regulatory activities or other activities necessary to gain approval and commercialize pegozafermin or any future product candidates. We currently have two active investigational new drug IND applications with the FDA in the United States for pegozafermin. In the future, we may file an additional IND with another division for any future indications or future product candidates. If any such future IND is not approved by the FDA, our clinical development timeline may be negatively impacted and any future clinical programs may be delayed or terminated. As a result, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or successfully commercialize our products. We do not know whether any other clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize pegozafermin and any future product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize pegozafermin or any future product candidates and may harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Our or our future collaborators inability to timely complete clinical development could result in additional costs to us as well as impair our ability to generate product revenue, continue development, commercialize pegozafermin and any future product candidates, reach sales milestone payments and receive royalties on product sales. In addition, if we make changes to a product candidate including, for example, a new formulation, we may need to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials to bridge or demonstrate the comparability of our modified product candidate to earlier versions, which could delay our clinical development plan or marketing approval for pegozafermin and any future product candidates. 
 If we encounter difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 
 The timely completion of clinical trials largely depends on patient enrollment. We may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our future clinical trials, and even once enrolled, we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Furthermore, there are inherent difficulties in diagnosing MASH, which can currently only be definitively diagnosed through a liver biopsy, and identifying SHTG patients. Specifically, identifying patients most likely to meet MASH enrollment criteria on biopsy is an ongoing challenge, with existing clinical indicators lacking both sensitivity and specificity. As a result, MASH trials often suffer from high levels of screen failure following central review of the baseline liver biopsy, which can lead to lower enrollment. In addition, we do not have experience enrolling patients with cirrhosis and such enrollment make take longer than we expect. As a result of such difficulties and the significant competition for recruiting MASH and SHTG patients in clinical trials, we or our future collaborators may be unable to enroll the patients we need to complete clinical trials on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have significantly greater resources than we do, are conducting clinical trials for the same indications and seek to enroll patients in their studies that may otherwise be eligible for our clinical studies or trials. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which could further reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in these sites. Further, in the event one of our competitors receives regulatory approval for their product candidate before we do, we may have difficulty enrolling patients if they choose to take an approved drug, rather than enroll in a clinical trial. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical studies or trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of pegozafermin and any future product candidates. We plan to leverage the safety database from the SHTG Phase 3 program across both the SHTG and MASH indications. If we are not able enroll enough patients in our trials sufficient to support the safety database, our ability to advance the development of pegozafermin may be adversely affected. 
 28 

We have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers and vendors to produce and release pegozafermin or any future product candidates. Any failure by a third-party to produce and release acceptable product candidates for us pursuant to our specifications and regulatory standards may delay or impair our ability to initiate or complete our clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals or commercialize approved products. 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so. As a result, we currently rely, and expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply us with pegozafermin and any future product candidates. We currently have contractual relationships with BTPH and BiBo pursuant to which they supply us with pegozafermin for our clinical trials. If there should be any disruption in our supply arrangement with BTPH or BiBo, including any adverse events affecting BTPH or BiBo, it could have a negative effect on the clinical development of pegozafermin and other operations while we work to identify and qualify an alternate supply source. In addition, we will require large quantities of pegozafermin for our large Phase 3 clinical trials and to commercialize pegozafermin. Accordingly, in April 2024, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with BiBo, pursuant to which BiBo will construct the Production Facility in China specifically designed to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply, however, we cannot guarantee that BiBo will be able to complete construction of the Production Facility and scale up and produce the quantities we would require to commercialize pegozafermin. 
 Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the Drug Substance required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide us with manufacturing capacity to meet our commercial needs. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are required to pay BiBo an aggregate of 135.0 million (exclusive of applicable value-added tax) toward the construction of the Production Facility, of which 81.0 million (net of applicable value-added tax) in milestone payments were paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The remainder of the Payment will become payable upon achievement of certain specified milestones, of which up to an additional 40.5 million of the Payment could become payable by the end of 2024. If the actual costs of the Production Facility are substantially greater than the estimated budget, the parties will negotiate a means of allocating such cost overruns. We may be ultimately responsible for a substantial portion of such overruns and it could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that BiBo will complete or make operational the Production Facility in a timely manner or at all. 
 We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including BiBo, if we receive regulatory approval for pegozafermin or any other product candidates. The terms of our commercial supply of pegozafermin may not be favorable to us and could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we may be ultimately responsible for a substantial portion of cost overruns and it could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. See further discussion in Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments. We cannot guarantee that BiBo will complete or make operational the Production Facility in a timely manner or at all. 
 There is no guarantee that our third-party manufacturers will be able to fulfill our supply needs. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufacture product candidates or products ourselves. For example, if any of our third-party manufacturers or vendors, including our fill-finish vendor, are not able to fulfill their supply or manufacturing obligations in a timely manner, our clinical trials may be delayed. In addition, if we do not maintain our key manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us, and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. 
 We have begun producing certain of the reagents required for the glycoPEGylation at BTPH using the know-how transferred to us from Teva under our Reagent Supply and Technology Transfer Agreement. We have not completed the manufacturing process for all these reagents and cannot guarantee that we will be able to produce them successfully, or scale up our production for the quantities needed for commercialization. 
 Any significant delay in the acquisition or decrease in the availability of these raw materials from suppliers could considerably delay the manufacture of pegozafermin, which could adversely impact the timing of any planned trials or the regulatory approvals of pegozafermin. 
 We rely on third-party vendors for our assay development and testing. If such third-party vendors are unable to successfully produce or test such assays, it may substantially increase our cost or could adversely impact the timing of any planned trials or the regulatory approvals of pegozafermin. 
 The FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices cGMP ). We have little to no control regarding the occurrence of third-party manufacturer incidents. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA or comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop pegozafermin or any future product candidates and market our products following approval. Our sole source supplier, BTPH, has not yet manufactured a commercial product, and as a result, has not been subject to inspection by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. 
 29 

Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis. Supply chain issues, including those resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine and the acts of piracy and military unrest in the Red Sea, may affect our third-party vendors and cause delays. Furthermore, since we have engaged a manufacturer located in China, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the legislation or policies of the United States, including the proposed BIOSECURE bill, or Chinese governments, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. For example, WuXi Biologics is identified in the proposed U.S. legislation known as the BIOSECURE Act as a biotechnology company of concern. The current version of the BIOSECURE Act introduced in the House of Representatives would prohibit federal agencies from entering into procurement contracts with, as well as providing grants and loans to, an entity that uses biotechnology equipment or services from a biotechnology company of concern, and includes a grandfathering provision allowing biotechnology equipment and services provided or produced by named biotechnology companies of concern under a contract or agreement entered into before the effective date until January 1, 2032. The pathway and timing for the BIOSECURE Act or its provisions to become law are uncertain, although the bill was passed in the House of Representatives on September 9, 2024. Foreign CMOs may be subject to U.S. legislation, including the proposed BIOSECURE bill, trade restrictions and other foreign regulatory requirements which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of material available to us, delay the procurement or supply of such material or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure significant commitments from governments to purchase our potential therapies. These and other risks associated with our collaboration with BiBo, based in China, may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain quantities of pegozafermin needed for commercialization, if approved. In addition, we have agreed to arbitrate claims related to the Collaboration Agreement with BiBo in Shanghai under the laws of the People s Republic of China, which may limit our ability to enforce our contractual rights against BiBo. Changes to Chinese regulations or government policies affecting biopharmaceutical companies are unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our collaborators in China which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Evolving changes in China s public health, economic, political, and social conditions and the uncertainty around China s relationship with other governments, such as the United States and the UK, could also negatively impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our planned clinical trials or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure government funding, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cause it to delay our clinical development programs. Furthermore, if the BIOSECURE bill is passed and one or more of our collaborators in China is deemed to be a biotechnology company of concern, our operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted as a result of any delays or increased costs arising from the trade restrictions and other foreign regulatory requirements affecting such collaborators. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. For example, in the event that we need to switch our third-party manufacturer of pegozafermin from BTPH or BiBo, which are our primary manufacturing sources for pegozafermin, we anticipate that the complexity of the glycoPEGylation manufacturing process may materially impact the amount of time it may take to secure a replacement manufacturer. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer, if we are able to identify an alternative source, could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. 
 Pegozafermin and any future product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the commercial profile of an approved label. 
 Undesirable side effects caused by pegozafermin or any future product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Additional clinical studies may be required to evaluate the safety profile of pegozafermin or any future product candidates. As with other drugs, we have seen evidence of adverse effects in animal and human studies and it is possible that other adverse effects will become apparent in ongoing or future animal or human studies. It may be difficult to discern whether certain events or symptoms observed during our clinical trials or by patients using our approved products are related to pegozafermin or any future product candidates or approved products or some other factor. As a result, we and our development programs may be negatively affected even if such events or symptoms are ultimately determined to be unlikely related to pegozafermin or any future product candidates or approved products. Further, we expect that pegozafermin will require multiple administrations via subcutaneous injection in the course of a clinical trial. This chronic administration increases the risk that rare adverse events or chance findings are discovered in the commercial setting, where pegozafermin would be administered to more patients or for greater periods of time, that were not uncovered by our clinical drug development programs. 
 We are developing pegozafermin for the treatment of MASH and the treatment of SHTG. The requirements for approval of pegozafermin by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may be difficult to predict and may change over time, which makes it difficult to predict the timing and costs of the clinical development. 
 We are developing pegozafermin for the treatment of MASH. Although there are guidelines issued by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the development of drugs for the treatment of MASH, the development of a novel product candidates such as pegozafermin may be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. As other companies are in later stages of clinical trials for their potential MASH therapies, we expect that the path for regulatory approval for MASH therapies may continue to evolve in the near term as these other companies refine their regulatory approval strategies and interact with regulatory authorities. Such evolution may impact our future clinical trial designs, including trial size and endpoints, in ways that we cannot predict today. In particular, regulatory authority expectations about liver biopsy data may evolve especially as more information is published about the inherent variability in liver biopsy data. Certain of our competitors have experienced regulatory setbacks for MASH therapies following communications from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We currently do not know the impact, if any, that these setbacks could have on the path for regulatory approval for MASH 
 30 

therapies generally or for pegozafermin. In addition, if one of the other companies receives regulatory approval for its MASH therapy before we do, such approval could impact our development of pegozafermin. We may have difficulty enrolling patients in our Phase 3 program for patients with MASH if patients choose to take an approved drug, rather than enroll in a clinical trial. In addition, we expect that the first therapy that is approved for the treatment of MASH will establish initial pricing and labelling expectations, which could impact our pricing and labelling if pegozafermin receives marketing approval. 
 We are also developing pegozafermin for the treatment of SHTG. Clinical trials for the treatment of SHTG may be relatively costly and time-consuming. In addition, the requirements for approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change over time. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional evidence in addition to our ongoing Phase 3 program in SHTG to support a successful submission for approval, we may be required to make changes to our program design that could impact timelines and cost. 
 Our anticipated development costs would likely increase if development of pegozafermin or any future product candidate is delayed because we are required by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies or trials in addition to, or different from, those that we currently anticipate, or make changes to ongoing or future clinical trial designs. In addition, if we are unable to leverage our safety database for both SHTG and MASH indications, we may be required to perform additional trials, which would result in increased costs and may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials. 
 Lack of efficacy, adverse events or undesirable side effects may emerge in clinical trials conducted by third parties developing FGF product candidates, which could adversely affect our stock price, our ability to attract additional capital and our development program. 
 Lack of efficacy, adverse events or undesirable side effects may emerge in clinical trials conducted by third parties developing FGF product candidates like ours. For example, Novo Nordisk, Akero Therapeutics, Inc. and Boston Pharmaceuticals are also developing FGF21 product candidates for the treatment of MASH. We have no control over their clinical trials or development program, and lack of efficacy, adverse events or undesirable side effects experienced by subjects in their clinical trials could adversely affect our stock price, our ability to attract additional capital and our clinical development plans for pegozafermin or even the viability or prospects of pegozafermin as a product candidate, including by creating a negative perception of FGF therapeutics by healthcare providers or patients. 
 Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 From time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical trials, which are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. In addition, we may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than all endpoints. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. 
 The manufacture of biologic products is complex and we are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products. 
 To date, pegozafermin has been manufactured by third-party manufacturers for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The process of manufacturing pegozafermin, and in particular, the glycoPEGylation process, is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including for the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of pegozafermin will not occur in the future. We have limited process development capabilities and have access only to external manufacturing capabilities. We do not have and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials or commercialization. 
 We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do. 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid innovation and significant technological advancements. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that we are targeting. Certain of these companies have published positive data regarding their clinical trials, which may further increase the competition we face. Smaller or earlier-stage companies may also prove to be 
 31 

significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Given the high incidence of MASH and SHTG, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases, such as MASH and SHTG, will increase. We may also face competition indirectly from companies developing therapies like the incretins to treat obesity and/or Type 2 diabetes. Some incretin-based therapies are also being developed for the treatment of MASH. 
 There are numerous currently approved therapies for treating diseases other than MASH and some of these currently approved therapies may exert effects that could be similar to pegozafermin in MASH. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. This may make it difficult for us to differentiate our products from currently approved therapies, which may adversely impact our business strategy. We expect that if pegozafermin or any future product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products, including branded generic products. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products prior to utilization of pegozafermin. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as pegozafermin or any future product candidates progress through clinical development. In addition, to the extent pegozafermin or any future product candidates are approved for liver or cardio-metabolic indications, such as SHTG, the commercial success of our products will also depend on our ability to demonstrate benefits over the then-prevailing standard of care, including diet, exercise and lifestyle modifications. 
 Further, if pegozafermin or any future product candidates are approved for the treatment of SHTG, we will compete with currently approved therapies and therapies further along in development. Our competitors both in the United States and abroad include large, well-established pharmaceutical and generic companies with significantly greater name recognition. Our competitors may be able to charge lower prices than we can, which may adversely affect our market acceptance. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do, including financial, product development, marketing, personnel and other resources. 
 If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer or cheaper than our products or that reach the market sooner than our products, we may not achieve commercial success. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop and succeed in obtaining approval for drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. 
 Unstable market and economic conditions, inflation, fluctuation in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine and Israel, or other macroeconomic conditions, may have serious adverse consequences on our business and financial condition. 
 The global economy, including credit and financial markets, have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions at various points over the last few decades, including, among other things, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain shortages, increases in inflation rates, fluctuating interest rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, public health crises have resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. In addition, the Federal Reserve has previously raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Fluctuation in interest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending. Similarly, the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and surrounding areas and the rising tensions between China and Taiwan have created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and may have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. Any such volatility and disruptions may adversely affect our business or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and share price and could require us to delay or abandon development or commercialization plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our service providers, manufacturers or other partners would not survive or be able to meet their commitments to us under such circumstances, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. 
 We have experienced and may in the future experience disruptions as a result of such macroeconomic conditions, including delays or difficulties in initiating or expanding clinical trials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of materials. Any one or a combination of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Loan Agreement contains certain covenants that could adversely affect our operations and, if an event of default were to occur, we could be forced to repay any outstanding indebtedness sooner than planned and possibly at a time when we do not have sufficient capital to meet this obligation. 
 Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property rights, and have agreed that we may not sell or assign rights to our patents and other intellectual property without the prior consent of our lenders. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that could prevent us from taking certain actions without the consent of our lenders. These covenants may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to take actions that might be advantageous to us and our stockholders. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, 
 32 

including, among other things, an event of default upon a change of control. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, all amounts due under the Loan Agreement become automatically (in the case of a bankruptcy event of default) or may become (in the case of all other events of default and at the option of the administrative agent), immediately due and payable. If an event of default under the Loan Agreement should occur and be continuing, we could be required to immediately repay any outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to repay such debt, the lenders would be able to foreclose on the secured collateral, including our cash accounts, and take other remedies permitted under the Loan Agreement. Even if we are able to repay such accelerated debt amount under the Loan Agreement upon an event of default, the repayment of these sums may significantly reduce our working capital and impair our ability to operate as planned. 
 We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could adversely affect our operations. 
 We are in the early stages of building the full team that we anticipate we will need to complete the development pegozafermin and other future product candidates. As we advance our preclinical and clinical development programs for product candidates, seek regulatory approval in the United States and elsewhere and increase the number of ongoing product development programs, we anticipate that we will need to increase our product development, scientific and administrative headcount. We will also need to establish commercial capabilities in order to commercialize any product candidates that may be approved. Such an evolution may impact our strategic focus and our deployment and allocation of resources. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively depends upon the continual improvement of our procedures, reporting systems and operational, financial and management controls. We may not be able to implement administrative and operational improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition, in order to continue to meet our obligations as a public company and to support our anticipated long-term growth, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities. Our management, personnel and systems may experience difficulty in adjusting to our growth and strategic focus. 
 We must attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to succeed. If we are not able to retain our current senior management team and our scientific advisors or continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer. 
 We may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel and consultants due to the intense competition for such individuals in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel and consultants to accomplish our business objectives, it may significantly impede the achievement of our development and commercial objectives and our ability to implement our business strategy. In addition, we are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, manufacturing, commercialization and financial expertise of the members of our executive team, as well as other key employees and consultants. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or other key employees or consultants, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. 
 We rely on third parties for certain aspects of our product candidate development process and we may not be able to obtain and maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop, commercialize and manufacture some or all of our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval, or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed. 
 We depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, manufacturers and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates and to manufacture clinical and commercial scale quantities of our drug substance and drug product and expect to depend on these third parties to market, sell and distribute any products we successfully develop. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities and such alternative arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us. We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development, marketing approval and/or commercialization of pegozafermin or any future product candidates, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue. 
 In addition, we have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third party contract research organizations CROs to conduct, monitor, and manage preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of clinical trials, and we manage and control only some aspects of their activities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including those required by the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable and evolving laws, regulations, and guidelines, the results generated in our clinical trials may be deemed insufficient or unreliable, and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. 
 Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 
 Our operations, and those of our contract research organizations, CMO, suppliers, and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, medical pandemics or epidemics, such as the novel coronavirus, and other natural or man-made 
 33 

disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 
 If we fail to develop and commercialize additional product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business. 
 Although the development and commercialization of pegozafermin is currently our primary focus, as part of our longer-term growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and commercialization of other therapies related to MASH and other liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. The success of this strategy depends primarily upon our ability to identify and validate new therapeutic candidates, and to identify, develop and commercialize new drugs and biologics. Our research efforts may initially show promise in discovering potential new drugs and biologics yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. 
 We may use our limited financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate that is ultimately unsuccessful or less successful than other programs or product candidates that we may have forgone or delayed. 
 Because we have limited personnel and financial resources, we may forego or delay the development of certain programs or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential than the programs or product candidates that we do pursue. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. 
 We may seek to establish commercial collaborations for our product candidates, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans. 
 Our drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may decide to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. 
 We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, in-license or acquire, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. 
 We may seek to identify, in-license or acquire, discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates. We cannot assure you that our effort to in-license or acquire additional product candidates will be successful. Even if we are successful in in-licensing or acquiring additional product candidates, their requisite development activities may require substantial resources, and we cannot assure you that these development activities will result in regulatory approvals. 
 Our international operations may expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. 
 Our use of our international facilities subjects us to U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and customs regulations and laws including various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Doing business internationally potentially involves a number of risks, any of which could harm our ongoing international clinical operations and supply chain, as well as any future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. 
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any resulting products. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, or others using our products. Our clinical trial liability insurance coverage may not adequately cover all liabilities that we may incur. 
 Our employees, contractors, vendors, principal investigators, consultants and future partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 
 We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, contractors, vendors, principal investigators, consultants or future partners. Misconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data timely, completely or accurately, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which may apply to items such as pharmaceutical products and services reimbursed by private insurers. We and/or our future partners may be subject to administrative, civil and criminal sanctions for violations of any of these laws. 
 34 

We depend on our information technology systems and those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants. Our internal computer systems, or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, disruptions, or incidents, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs or loss of data or compromise the privacy, security, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive information related to our business and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Our internal technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current or future third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access or use resulting from malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war and information technology, telecommunication and electrical failures, denial-of-service attacks, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, hacking, phishing and other social engineering attacks, persons inside our organizations (including employees or contractors), loss or theft, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. From time to time, we are subject to periodic phishing attempts. In the third quarter of 2021, we discovered a business email compromise caused by phishing. The phishing attack did not result in the misappropriation of any funds and we do not believe that it had a material adverse effect on our business. We implemented remedial measures promptly following this incident, however, we cannot guarantee that our implemented remedial measures will prevent additional related, as well as unrelated, incidents. If a material system failure, accident or security breach were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and significant reputational, financial, legal, regulatory, business or operational harm. 
 To the extent that any real or perceived security breach affects our systems (or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants), or results in the loss of or accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access to, use of, release of, or other processing of personally identifiable information or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants to comply with our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, or any data security incidents or other security breaches that result in the accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access to, use of, release of, processing of, or transfer of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, may result in negative publicity, harm to our reputation, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation or public statements against us, could cause third parties to lose trust in us or could result in claims by third parties, including those that assert that we have breached our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Approvals 
 Pegozafermin has not received regulatory approval. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market pegozafermin or any future product candidates, our business will be adversely affected. 
 We do not expect pegozafermin or any future product candidate to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Pegozafermin is and any future product candidate will be subject to strict regulation by regulatory authorities in the United States and in other countries. We cannot market any product candidate until we have completed all necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. We do not know whether regulatory agencies will grant approval for pegozafermin or any future product candidate. Even if we complete preclinical studies and clinical trials successfully, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or we may not receive approvals to make claims about our products that we believe to be necessary to effectively market our products. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials is subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and failure to comply with regulatory requirements or inadequate manufacturing processes are examples of other problems that could prevent approval. 
 The regulatory authorities in the United States and the EU have not approved any products for the treatment of MASH, and while there are guidelines issued by the FDA for the development of drugs for the treatment of MASH, it is unclear whether the requirements for approval will change in the future or whether the FDA will rely on regulatory precedent for future regulatory approvals. Any such changes may require us to conduct new trials that could delay our timeframe and increase the costs of our programs related to pegozafermin or any future product candidate for the treatment of MASH or SHTG. 
 Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for pegozafermin or any future product candidate, if they exhibit harmful side effects after approval, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. 
 Even if we receive regulatory approval for pegozafermin or any future product candidates, we will have tested them in only a small number of patients during our clinical trials. If our applications for marketing are approved and more patients begin to use our product, new risks and side effects associated with our products may be discovered. As a result, regulatory authorities may revoke their approvals. Based on guidelines issued by the FDA for the development of drugs for the treatment of MASH, if pegozafermin is approved by the FDA based on a surrogate endpoint pursuant to section 506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the accelerated approval regulations (21 C.F.R. part 314, subpart H; 21 C.F.R. part 601, subpart E), consistent with FDA guidance, we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials establishing clinical benefit on the ultimate outcome of MASH. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such studies be underway prior to approval or 
 35 

within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. If pegozafermin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of SHTG based on an endpoint of the reduction of triglycerides, the FDA may still require a cardiovascular outcomes study as part of a post-marketing authorization commitment. Such a study would be time consuming and costly and we cannot guarantee that we will see positive results, which could result in the revocation of the approval. Additionally, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of our product, reformulate our product or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers manufacturing facilities for pegozafermin and any future product candidates. We might have to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of our product if and when regulatory approvals for such product are revoked. As a result, we may experience harm to our reputation in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of our approved product or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our product. 
 The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval for pegozafermin or any future product candidates would substantially harm our business. 
 Currently, we do not have any product candidates that have received regulatory approval. The time required to obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate s development and may vary among jurisdictions. It is possible that none of pegozafermin or any future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval. Pegozafermin or any future product candidate could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for many reasons, including those referenced in Part I, Item 1. Business Government Regulation and Product Approval in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of the product candidate. 
 We have received Breakthrough Therapy designation for pegozafermin in MASH from the FDA and PRIME designation for pegozafermin in MASH from the EMA, but such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that pegozafermin will receive marketing approval. In addition, we may seek Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track or PRIME designation for other indications or future product candidates, but we might not receive such designation. 
 In September 2023, we received Breakthrough Therapy designation for pegozafermin in MASH from the FDA. However, the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation for pegozafermin in MASH may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. 
 In March 2024, the EMA granted PRIME status to pegozafermin in patients with MASH, and, in the future, we may seek Fast Track designation or PRIME designation for our other product candidates. If a drug or biologic is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug or biologic demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the sponsor may apply for Fast Track designation. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. 
 PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for research on and development of medicines that have demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy and thus the potential to target a significant unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. This regulatory program offers developers of promising medicines enhanced interaction and early dialogue with the EMA and is designed to optimize development plans and speed evaluation ensuring these medicines reach patients as early as possible. The EMA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. 
 In addition, we may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation, Fast Track designation or PRIME designation for other indications or future product candidates. Even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the FDA, EMA or similar regulatory agency would decide to grant them. Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and PRIME designations may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA or EMA procedures, respectively. In addition, even though pegozafermin is designated as a Breakthrough Therapy in MASH, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for designation and the designation may be rescinded. The Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and PRIME designations do not assure ultimate regulatory approval by the FDA or the EMA. Many drugs and biologics that have received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track or PRIME designation have failed to obtain approval. See Part I, Item 1. Business Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We plan to conduct clinical trials for pegozafermin at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations. 
 36 

We have conducted and expect in the future to conduct one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and would delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidates. Even if the FDA accepted such data, it could require us to modify our planned clinical trials to receive clearance to initiate such trials in the United States or to continue such trials once initiated. 
 Further, conducting international clinical trials presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials, the administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple sets of foreign regulations, foreign exchange fluctuations, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, as well as political and economic risks relevant to foreign countries. 
 Even if pegozafermin or any future product candidate receives regulatory approval, it may still face future development and regulatory difficulties. 
 Even if we obtained regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP, regulations and standards. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or undesirable side effects caused by such products are identified, a regulatory agency may: issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product; mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; require that we conduct post-marketing studies; require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; suspend marketing of, withdraw regulatory approval of or recall such product; suspend any ongoing clinical studies; refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us; suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or require us to initiate a product recall. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate product revenue. 
 We expect the product candidates we develop will be regulated as biologics, and therefore they may be subject to competition sooner than anticipated. 
 The BPCIA was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any of these processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. 
 We believe that any of the product candidates we develop that is approved in the United States as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the subject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. 
 In addition, the first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. The approval of a biologic product 
 37 

biosimilar to one of our product candidates could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our product candidates. 
 Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us, and any collaborators, to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain. 
 Heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA ), which, among other provisions, included several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms. We cannot be sure whether additional legislation or rulemaking related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future. 
 Healthcare insurance coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable for our product candidate, if approved, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidate or other therapies profitably. 
 The success of pegozafermin, if approved, depends on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial payors, and health maintenance organizations. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for, or accurately estimate the potential revenue from, our product candidates or assure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we may develop. 
 Governments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenue, if any. 
 In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate to other available procedures. If reimbursement of our drugs is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies. 
 Our success will depend in significant part on our current or future licensors , licensees or collaborators ability to establish and maintain adequate protection of our owned and licensed intellectual property covering the product candidates we plan to develop, and the ability to develop these product candidates and commercialize the products resulting therefrom, without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to taking other steps to protect our intellectual property, we hold issued patents, we have applied for patents, and we intend to continue to apply for patents with claims covering our technologies, processes and product candidates when and where we deem it appropriate to do so. We have filed numerous patent applications both in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions to obtain patent rights to inventions we have discovered, with claims directed to compositions of matter, methods of use and other technologies relating to our programs. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will issue as patents or, for those applications that do mature into patents, that the claims of the patents will exclude others from making, using or selling our product candidates or products that compete with or are similar to our product candidates. In countries where we have not sought and do not seek patent protection, third parties may be able to manufacture and sell our product candidates without our permission, and we may not be able to stop them from doing so. 
 With respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect our technologies, processes and product candidates, or if any of our issued patents or our current or future licensors , licensees or collaborators issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies, processes and products. We cannot be certain that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. 
 Any changes we make to our pegozafermin or any future product candidates to cause them to have what we view as more advantageous properties may not be covered by our existing patents and patent applications, and we may be required to file new applications and/or seek other forms of protection for any such altered product candidates. The patent landscape surrounding the technology underlying our product candidates is crowded, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure patent protection that would adequately cover an alternative to pegozafermin or any future product candidates. 
 38 

We and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection for them. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and may be reliant on our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to perform these activities, which means that these patent applications may not be prosecuted, and these patents enforced, in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators fail to establish, maintain, protect or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. 
 Similar to the patent rights of other biotechnology companies, the scope, validity and enforceability of our owned and licensed patent rights generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. In recent years, these areas have been the subject of much litigation in the industry. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our current or future licensors , licensees or collaborators patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our current or future licensors , licensees or collaborators pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, or products resulting therefrom, in whole or in part, or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. The patent examination process may require us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators to narrow the scope of the claims of pending and future patent applications, which would limit the scope of patent protection that is obtained, if any. Our and our current or future licensors , licensees or collaborators patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology that is currently claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the claims that issue are broad enough to cover the technology being practiced by those third parties. 
 Furthermore, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after the resulting products are commercialized. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms for our issued patents, where available. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any comparable foreign regulatory authorities, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. In addition, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to the expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 
 The legal protection afforded to inventors and owners of intellectual property in countries outside of the United States may not be as protective or effective as that in the United States and we may, therefore, be unable to acquire and enforce intellectual property rights outside the United States to the same extent as in the United States. Whether filed in the United States or abroad, our patent applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States are less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and certain state laws in the United States. 
 Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with pegozafermin or any future product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 We rely on a license from Teva and a sublicense from ratiopharm to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology that are used in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pegozafermin. Any termination or loss of significant rights, including the right to glycoPEGylation technology, or breach, under these agreements or any future license agreement related to our product candidates, would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue the development and commercialization of the related product candidates. 
 In April 2018, we entered into the FGF21 Agreement with Teva under which we acquired certain patents, intellectual property and other assets relating to Teva s glycoPEGylated FGF21 program including pegozafermin. Under this agreement, we were granted a perpetual, non-exclusive (but exclusive as to pegozafermin), non-transferable, worldwide license to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology used in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pegozafermin and products containing pegozafermin. The FGF21 Agreement also contains numerous covenants with which we must comply, including the utilization of commercially reasonable efforts to develop and ultimately commercialize pegozafermin, as well as certain reporting covenants and the obligation to make royalty payments, if and when pegozafermin is approved for commercialization. Our failure to satisfy any of these covenants could result in the termination of the FGF21 Agreement. In addition, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with ratiopharm (the ratiopharm Sublicense ), under which we were granted a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide sublicense to patents and know-how related to glycoPEGylation technology used in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pegozafermin and products containing pegozafermin. Termination of the FGF21 Agreement or the ratiopharm Sublicense will impact our rights under 
 39 

the intellectual property licensed to us by Teva and ratiopharm, respectively, including our license to glycoPEGylation technology, but will not affect our rights under the assets assigned to us. 
 Beyond this agreement, our commercial success will also depend upon our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. A third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. As a result, we may enter into additional license agreements in the future. If we fail to comply with the obligations under these agreements, including payment and diligence obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell any product that is covered by these agreements or to engage in any other activities necessary to our business that require the freedom to operate afforded by the agreements, or we may face other penalties under the agreements. 
 We may be unable to obtain intellectual property rights or technology necessary to develop and commercialize pegozafermin and any future product candidates. 
 The patent landscape around our programs is complex, and we are aware of several third-party patents and patent applications containing subject matter that might be relevant to pegozafermin. Depending on what claims ultimately issue from these patent applications, and how courts construe the issued patent claims, as well as depending on the ultimate formulation and method of use of pegozafermin or any future product candidates, we may need to obtain a license to practice the technology claimed in such patents. There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 We may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 
 Third parties may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. In the future, we may initiate legal proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own, control or to which we have rights. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable or interpreted in such a manner that would not preclude third parties from entering the market with competing products. 
 Third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings, or other pre-issuance or post-grant proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation in the United States or other jurisdictions provoked by third parties or brought by us, may be necessary to determine the inventorship, priority, patentability or validity of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could leave our technology or product candidates without patent protection, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or could require us to obtain license rights from the prevailing party in order to be able to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party in such a case does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Even if we successfully defend such litigation or proceeding, we may incur substantial costs and our defense may distract our management and other employees. 
 Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions have rules of discovery that are different than those in the United States and that may make defending or enforcing our patents extremely difficult. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. 
 Third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties. 
 Third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties, including in oppositions, interferences, revocations, reexaminations, inter partes review or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or its counterparts in other jurisdictions. These proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and many of our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. We could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent of a third party. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our pegozafermin or any future product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. 
 Although we have reviewed certain third-party patents and patent filings that we believe may be relevant to our therapeutic candidates or products, we have not conducted a freedom-to-operate search or analysis for any of our therapeutic candidates or products, and we may not be aware of patents or pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing our product candidates. Thus, we cannot guarantee that our product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, do not and will not infringe any third party s intellectual property.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly and results announced by us and our collaborators or competitors could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those described in these Risk Factors, including business developments announced by us and by our collaborators and competitors, or as a result of market trends and daily trading volume. The business developments that could affect our stock price include announcements or disclosures from competitors in the same class or category, new collaborations, clinical advancement, commercial launch or discontinuation of product candidates in the same class or category and regulatory approvals for our product candidates or product candidates in the same class or category. Our stock price could also fluctuate significantly with the level of overall investment interest in small-cap biotechnology stocks or for other reasons unrelated to our business. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. 
 Sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, or issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of warrants could depress the price of our common stock. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have filed a registration statement registering under the Securities Act the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan and the Amended and Restated 2023 Inducement Plan, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. Further, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt or equity securities. 
 In addition, we must settle exercises of our outstanding warrants in shares of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the market s expectation that exercises may occur could depress the trading price of our common stock even in the absence of actual exercises. Moreover, the expectation of exercises could encourage the short selling of our common stock, which could place further downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. 
 Certain of our executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the executive officer or director when entering into the plan, without further direction from the executive officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our executive officers and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information. 
 Raising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies. 
 Existing stockholders could suffer dilution or be negatively affected by fixed payment obligations we may incur if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity securities, including under the ATM Facility (defined above), or debt. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants or protective rights that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. 
 Hedging activity by investors in the warrants could depress the trading price of our common stock. 
 We expect that many investors in our warrants will seek to employ an arbitrage strategy. Under this strategy, investors typically short sell a certain number of shares of our common stock and adjust their short position over time while they continue to hold the warrants. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of, or in addition to, short selling shares of our common stock. This market activity, or the market s perception that it will occur, could depress the trading price of our common stock. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Our directors, executive officers and current holders of 5 or more of our capital stock have substantial control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters subject to stockholder approval, including a change of control. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our executive officers, directors and other holders of 5 or more of our common stock beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors and other holders of 5 or more of our 
 41 

common stock, if they act, will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. In addition, our current directors, executive officers and other holders of 5 or more of our common stock, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our company. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our stock may decrease. 
 We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 also requires our independent auditors to express an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal controls in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a public company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or Section 404. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could prevent a third party from acquiring us (even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders), may limit the ability of our stockholders to replace our management and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination specified in the statute with an interested stockholder (as defined in the statute) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in advance by a majority of the independent directors or by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding disinterested shares. The application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides further that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. If a 
 42 

court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited. If we are required to pay any tax assessment, it could impact our net operating loss carryforwards, as well as our results of operations and financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of 195.0 million and 302.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2023, we also had gross federal tax credits of 7.5 million, which may be used to offset future tax liabilities. Certain NOLs and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2039. Use of our NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards depends on many factors, including having current or future taxable income, which cannot be assured. 
 In addition, in December 2023, the Israeli Tax Authorities issued a tax assessment claiming our 2019 reorganization and intercompany transaction to license the intellectual property rights from our subsidiary in Israel should be treated as a sale of intellectual property rights. If this matter is litigated and the Israeli Tax Authorities are able to successfully sustain their position and we are required to pay a tax assessment, it could impact our NOL carryforwards and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. See further discussion in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Income Taxes and in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Litigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 From time to time we may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, securities litigation, employment matters, security of patient and employee personal information, contractual relations with collaborators and licensors and intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

coverage required hereunder (the Delivery Requirements ), then Sublandlord will have no obligation to so deliver possession of the Subleased Premises to Subtenant, but the failure on the part of Sublandlord to so deliver possession of the Subleased Premises to Subtenant in such event will not serve to delay the occurrence of the Commencement Date and the commencement of Subtenant s obligations to pay Rent (defined below) hereunder. 

(ii) Early Access . Subtenant and Subtenant s representatives will have the right to enter the Subleased Premises from and after the later to occur of (A) the Consent Date and (B) the date upon which Subtenant satisfies the Delivery Requirements (the date upon which Subtenant first has such access to the Subleased Premises being referred to herein as the Early Access Date for the sole purpose of preparing the Subleased Premises for Subtenant s occupancy, including without limitation coordinating Subtenant s move into the Subleased Premises, installing Subtenant s personal property and fitting-up the FF E (defined below) and voice and data cabling, all subject to the terms, conditions and requirements of the Master Lease. All of the rights and obligations of the parties under this Sublease (other than Subtenant s obligation to pay Base Rent, but expressly including without limitation Subtenant s obligation to pay excess utility charges pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Master Lease and carry insurance, as well as Subtenant s indemnification obligations) shall commence upon the Early Access Date. Subtenant shall coordinate any such entry with Sublandlord. 

(iii) Failure to Obtain Consent . Promptly following the mutual execution and delivery of this Sublease, Sublandlord will request that Landlord issue the Consent, and Sublandlord and Subtenant each agree to use good faith efforts to cooperate with Landlord and each other in order to obtain the Consent on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Consent has not been obtained as of the date that is forty-five (45) days following the mutual execution and delivery of this Sublease on terms acceptable to the parties in each party s sole and absolute discretion, either party hereto may terminate this Sublease by written notice delivered to the other at any time thereafter, but before, Landlord grants such consent. Any legal fees, fees or other consideration charged by Landlord for its review of, and consent to, this Sublease shall be borne solely by Sublandlord (not to exceed 5,000.00 in the aggregate), and Subtenant shall be responsible for any fees to the extent in excess of such cap.

If the Commencement Date does not occur on December 1, 2023, as anticipated by the parties when entering into this Sublease, they will update this rent table in the Confirmation of Sublease Commencement Date. 
 It is the intention of the parties that this Sublease will, subject to its terms, generally be a so-called full service or gross sublease; as such, Base Rent is inclusive of all regularly recurring payments in respect of Direct Expenses (as defined in the Master Lease), and Subtenant shall not owe any separate or additional sums in respect of recurring Direct Expenses under this Sublease. Except as noted in the preceding sentence, in addition to the Base Rent, from and after the Commencement Date, Subtenant shall pay, as additional rent, any and all incidental or additional charges, fees or expenses that become payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease as a result of Subtenant s use and occupancy of the Subleased Premises during the Term, including, without limitation, any use by Subtenant of additional services for which Landlord charges separate fees pursuant to the Master Lease (such as any excess utilities charges or After-Hours HVAC fees as defined and described in Section 6.2 of the Master Lease). Base Rent and additional rent are collectively referred to herein as Rent . 
 Base Rent shall be paid in advance on the first day of each month of the Term, except that Subtenant shall pay one (1) month s Base Rent (i.e., 73,400.00)( Pre-paid Base Rent to Sublandlord within three (3) business days following the mutual execution and delivery of this Sublease; said Pre-Paid Base Rent will be applied to the first (1st) month s Base Rent due and payable hereunder following the Abatement Period, defined below. In the event Subtenant fails to deliver the Prepaid Base Rent within such 3-business day period, such failure shall be deemed a Default hereunder without the application of any additional cure period and Sublandlord shall have the right to terminate this Sublease by written notice to Subtenant, and upon such termination, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for any obligations or liabilities which expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease). If the Term does not begin on the first day of a calendar month or end on the last day of a month, the Base Rent for any partial month shall be prorated by multiplying the monthly Base Rent by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of the partial month included in the Term and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the full calendar month. All Rent shall be payable in lawful money of the United States, by ACH wire transfer or by regular bank check of Subtenant, to Sublandlord at the following address: 
 AP at Sendoso Attention: Daniel Kopelovich Email: ap@sendoso.com and daniel.kopelovich@sendoso.com 
 or to such other persons or at such other places as Sublandlord may designate in writing. 
 (ii) Abatement . Notwithstanding anything in Section 3(a)(i) above to the contrary, so long as Subtenant is not in Default, Subtenant shall be entitled to an abatement of Base Rent for the first four (4) full calendar months of the Term (the Abatement Period ); the Abatement Period will not include any partial calendar month immediately following 

3 

the Commencement Date. The total amount of Base Rent abated during the Abatement Period, in the amount of 293,600.00, is referred to herein as the Abated Rent . If Subtenant is in Default at any time during the Term, then (A) if such Default occurs prior to the expiration of the Abatement Period, there will be no further Abatement of Base Rent pursuant to this Section 3(a)(ii) unless and until Subtenant cures such Default and such cure is accepted by Sublandlord in lieu of seeking to terminate this Sublease due to such Default, and (B), if this Sublease is terminated due to Subtenant s Default, then, at Sublandlord s option, all then-unamortized Abated Rent (assuming amortization of the Abated Rent on a straight-line basis over the Term) shall immediately become due and payable by Subtenant. The payment by Subtenant of such Abated Rent in the event the Sublease terminates as a result of Subtenant s Default shall not limit or affect any of Sublandlord s other rights, pursuant to this Sublease or at law or in equity. During the Abatement Period, only Base Rent shall be abated, and all other costs and charges specified in this Sublease shall remain as due and payable pursuant to the provisions of this Sublease. 

(b) Other Taxes Payable by Tenant . Subtenant shall pay before delinquency any and all taxes levied or assessed and which become payable by Subtenant (or directly or indirectly by Sublandlord) during the Term, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto, which are based upon, measured by or otherwise calculated with respect to: (i) the gross or net rental income of Sublandlord under this Sublease, including, without limitation, any gross receipts tax levied by any taxing authority, or any other gross income tax or excise tax levied by any taxing authority with respect to the receipt of the rental payable hereunder, inclusive of the San Francisco Gross Receipts Tax and Business Registration Fees Ordinance (2012 Proposition E) and the Commercial Rent Tax for Childcare and Early Education (2018 Proposition C) Early Care Tax ); (ii) the value of Subtenant s equipment, furniture, fixtures or other personal property located in the Subleased Premises (including the FF E during the Term); (iii) the possession, lease, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Subtenant of the Subleased Premises or any portion thereof; or (iv) this transaction or any document to which Subtenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Subleased Premises. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the Early Care Tax imposed on Landlord with respect to the rent payable under the Master Lease (as distinguished from the Rent payable under this Sublease) shall not be subject to payment or reimbursement by Subtenant as additional Rent hereunder or otherwise. For clarity, if any particular gross receipts tax is imposed by a taxing authority based upon the rent payable by Sublandlord under the Master Lease and upon the rent payable by Subtenant under this Sublease (i.e., such tax is imposed at both the lease level and the sublease level ), then Subtenant shall be responsible for only the gross receipts tax based upon the rent payable under this Sublease (and Sublandlord shall remain solely responsible for such tax based upon the rent payable under the Master Lease without being permitted to pass the same through to Subtenant). 

4. Security Deposit . Within three (3) business days following the mutual execution and delivery of this Sublease, Subtenant shall deposit with Sublandlord the sum of 160,412.32 (the Security Deposit ). In the event Subtenant fails to deliver the Security Deposit within such 3-business day period, such failure shall be deemed a Default hereunder without the application of any additional cure period and Sublandlord shall have the right to terminate this Sublease by written notice to Subtenant, and upon such termination, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder (except for any obligations or liabilities which expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease). The Security Deposit shall be held 

4 

by Sublandlord as security for the faithful performance by Subtenant of all the provisions of this Sublease to be performed or observed by Subtenant. If Subtenant fails to pay rent or other sums due hereunder, or otherwise is in breach with respect to any provisions of this Sublease beyond the applicable notice and cure period (if any), or in the event of an uncured failure by Subtenant to perform one or more of its obligations under this Sublease and the existence of circumstances in which Sublandlord is enjoined or otherwise prevented by operation of law from giving to Subtenant a written notice which would be necessary for such failure of performance to constitute a default beyond the applicable notice and cure period, Sublandlord may use, apply or retain all or any portion of the Security Deposit for the payment of any past due sum or for the payment of any other sum to which Sublandlord may become obligated by reason of Subtenant s breach, or to compensate Sublandlord for any loss or damage which Sublandlord may suffer thereby. If Sublandlord so uses or applies all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Subtenant shall within ten (10) days after demand therefor deposit cash with Sublandlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the full amount thereof and Subtenant s failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Sublease. If Subtenant performs all of Subtenant s obligations hereunder, the Security Deposit, or so much thereof as has not theretofore been applied by Sublandlord, shall be returned, without interest, to Subtenant (or, at Sublandlord s option, to the last assignee, if any, of Subtenant s interest hereunder) within forty-five (45) days following the later to occur of (a) the expiration of the Term, and (b) Subtenant s vacation from the Subleased Premises and completion of all removal, repair and restoration obligations of Subtenant. No trust relationship is created herein between Sublandlord and Subtenant with respect to the Security Deposit. Sublandlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its other accounts. Subtenant hereby waives any and all rights under and the benefits of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code (except for Section 1950.7(b)), and all other provisions of law now in force or that become in force after the date of execution of this Sublease, that provide that Sublandlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy any failure to timely pay Rent, to repair damage caused by Subtenant, or to clean the Subleased Premises. Sublandlord and Subtenant agree that Sublandlord may, in addition, claim those sums reasonably necessary to compensate Sublandlord for any other loss or damage caused by Subtenant s Default. 

5. Use and Occupancy . 

(a) Use . The Subleased Premises shall be used and occupied only for general office use and ancillary uses consistent with a first-class building, and for no other use or purpose. 

(b) Compliance with Master Lease . Subtenant will occupy the Subleased Premises in accordance with the terms of the Master Lease and will not suffer to be done, or omit to do, any act which may result in a violation of or a default under the Master Lease, or render Sublandlord liable for any damage, charge or expense thereunder. Except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sublandlord, its agents, employees or contractors, Subtenant will indemnify, defend protect and hold Sublandlord harmless from and against any loss, cost, damage or liability (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any kind or nature arising out of, by reason of, or resulting from, (i) Subtenant s failure to perform or observe any of the terms and conditions of (x) the Master Lease which are Subtenant s obligation to perform or observe pursuant to this Sublease, or (y) this Sublease, or (ii) any accident, damage or injury to any person or property occurring in, on or about the Subleased Premises after the Early 

5 

Access Date, or any work done in or to the Subleased Premises after the Early Access Date; or (iii) the negligent acts or omissions of Subtenant, its agents, employees, or contractors. Except to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Subtenant, its agents, employees or contractors, Sublandlord will indemnify, protect and hold Subtenant harmless from and against any loss, cost, damage or liability (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any kind or nature arising out of, by reason of, or resulting from, (i) Sublandlord s failure to perform or observe any of the terms and conditions of the Master Lease (unless caused by Subtenant s breach or default under this Sublease) or of this Sublease beyond any applicable notice and cure periods, or (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sublandlord, its agents, employees or contractors. The indemnifications in this Section 5(b) will survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Sublease. Any other provision in this Sublease to the contrary notwithstanding, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord as Rent hereunder any and all sums which Sublandlord may be required to pay the Landlord arising out of a request by Subtenant for, or the use by Subtenant of, additional or over-standard Building services from Landlord (for example, but not by way of limitation, charges associated with after-hours HVAC usage and overstandard electrical charges). 

(c) Landlord s Obligations . Subtenant agrees that Sublandlord shall not be required to perform any of the covenants, agreements and/or obligations of Landlord under the Master Lease, including, without limitation, the services provided in Article 7 of the Master Lease, and, insofar as any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of Sublandlord hereunder are required to be performed under the Master Lease by Landlord thereunder, Subtenant acknowledges and agrees that Sublandlord shall be entitled to look to Landlord for such performance. In addition, Sublandlord shall have no obligation to perform any repairs or any other obligation of Landlord under the Master Lease, nor shall any representations or warranties made by Landlord under the Master Lease be deemed to have been made by Sublandlord. Sublandlord shall not be responsible for any failure or interruption, for any reason whatsoever, of the services or facilities that may be appurtenant to or supplied at the Building by Landlord or otherwise, including, without limitation, heat, air conditioning, ventilation, life-safety, water, electricity, elevator service and cleaning service, if any; and no failure to furnish, or interruption of, any such services or facilities shall give rise to any (i) abatement, diminution or reduction of Subtenant s obligations under this Sublease, or (ii) liability on the part of Sublandlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Sublandlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to secure such performance upon Subtenant s request to Sublandlord to do so and shall thereafter diligently prosecute such performance on the part of Landlord, provided that in no event will this sentence or any other provision of this Sublease be construed to require Sublandlord to commence any litigation, arbitration, judicial reference, or other similar proceeding against Landlord; and (ii) in the event that Sublandlord actually receives an abatement of rent under the Master Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises as result of an interruption of services thereto, then Subtenant shall receive a corresponding abatement of Base Rent under this Sublease (not to exceed the corresponding amounts payable by Subtenant to Sublandlord pursuant to the terms hereof or the amount actually received by Sublandlord, whichever is less). 

(d) Sublandlord s Covenants and Agreements . 

(i) Sublandlord represents and warrants to Subtenant that, to Sublandlord s actual knowledge, as of the Effective Date, (a) Exhibit D to this Sublease is a true, correct and complete copy of the Master Lease, as may be redacted; (b) the Master Lease is in full 

6 

force and effect; and (c) Sublandlord is not in default or breach of any of the provisions of the Master Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure periods. 

(ii) Sublandlord agrees that it will not amend or modify the Master Lease during the Term of this Sublease in any way that adversely affects Subtenant to any material extent; provided, however, that Sublandlord reserves the right to exercise any express termination rights it may have under the Master Lease. 

(e) Subtenant s Obligations . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Sublease to the contrary, Subtenant shall have no obligation to remove any alterations, additions or improvements existing as of the Commencement Date (or, if applicable, the Early Access Date), nor to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Landlord or Sublandlord with respect to matters occurring prior to Subtenant first entering the Subleased Premises. 

6. Master Lease and Sublease Terms . 

(a) Subject to Master Lease . This Sublease is and shall be at all times subject and subordinate to the Master Lease. Subtenant acknowledges that Subtenant has reviewed and is familiar with all of the terms, agreements, covenants and conditions of the Master Lease. During any period of early access and the Term, and for all periods subsequent thereto with respect to obligations which have arisen prior to the termination of this Sublease, Subtenant agrees to perform and comply with, for the benefit of Sublandlord and Landlord, the obligations of Sublandlord under the Master Lease which pertain to the Subleased Premises and/or this Sublease to the extent incorporated herein, except for those provisions of the Master Lease which are inconsistent with, or directly contradicted by this Sublease, in which event the terms of this Sublease document shall control over the Master Lease. If any of the express provisions of this Sublease conflict with any portion of the Master Lease as incorporated herein, the express terms of this Sublease shall govern as between Sublandlord and Subtenant. 

(b) Incorporation of Terms of Master Lease . The terms, conditions and respective obligations of Sublandlord and Subtenant to each other under this Sublease shall be the terms and conditions of the Master Lease to the extent incorporated herein, except for those provisions of the Master Lease which are inconsistent with or directly contradicted or modified by the express terms of this Sublease, in which event the terms of this Sublease shall control over the Master Lease. Therefore, for the purposes of this Sublease, wherever in the Master Lease the word Landlord is used it shall be deemed to mean Sublandlord and wherever in the Master Lease the word Tenant is used it shall be deemed to mean Subtenant. Additionally, wherever in the Master Lease the word Premises is used it shall be deemed to mean the Subleased Premises. Any non- liability, release, indemnity or hold harmless provision in the Master Lease for the benefit of Landlord that is incorporated herein by reference, shall be deemed to inure to the benefit of Sublandlord, Landlord, and any other person intended to be benefited by said provision, for the purpose of incorporation by reference in this Sublease. Any right of Landlord under the Master Lease (i) of access or inspection, (ii) to do work in the Master Lease Premises or in the Building, (iii) in respect of rules and regulations, which is incorporated herein by reference, shall be deemed to inure to the benefit of Sublandlord, Landlord, and any other person intended to be benefited by said provision, for the purpose of incorporation by reference in this Sublease. 

7 

(c) Modifications . For the purposes of incorporation herein, the terms of the Master Lease are subject to the following additional modifications: 

(i) Approvals . In all provisions of the Master Lease (under the terms thereof and without regard to modifications thereof for purposes of incorporation into this Sublease) requiring the approval or consent of Landlord, Subtenant shall be required to obtain the approval or consent of both Sublandlord and Landlord. Sublandlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Subtenant in obtaining the consent of Landlord where any such consent is required by this Sublease or the Master Lease, at no out-of-pocket cost to Sublandlord. If Subtenant shall submit to Sublandlord a request for Landlord s consent or approval with respect to any given matter requiring consent under this Sublease or the Master Lease, then Sublandlord shall promptly forward such request on to Landlord for its consent or approval. 

(ii) Obligations Outside of Master Lease Premises . Sublandlord shall not be obligated to perform those obligations of Landlord which require access to areas outside of the Master Lease Premises or that are not permitted to be taken by Sublandlord pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. For example, but not by way of limitation, Sublandlord shall not be obligated to perform Landlord s obligations under the Master Lease to maintain the roof, foundations, slabs, structural elements, subfloors, exterior walls, drainage systems, or any electrical, plumbing, mechanical or life-safety equipment or systems, any common area or any other repair or maintenance obligations which are Landlord s obligations under the Master Lease. 

(iii) Deliveries . In all provisions of the Master Lease requiring Sublandlord, as tenant, to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide Landlord with evidence, certificates, or any other matter or thing, Subtenant shall be required to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide, as the case may be, the same to both Landlord and Sublandlord. 

(iv) Damage; Condemnation . Sublandlord shall have no obligation to restore or rebuild any portion of the Subleased Premises after any destruction or taking by eminent domain. Any rights of Subtenant to abatement of Rent shall be conditioned upon Sublandlord s ability to abate rent for the Subleased Premises under the terms of the Master Lease. 

(v) Insurance . In all provisions of the Master Lease requiring Sublandlord, as tenant, to designate Landlord as an additional or named insured on its insurance policy, Subtenant shall be required to so designate Landlord and Sublandlord on its insurance policy. Sublandlord shall have no obligation to maintain the insurance to be maintained by Landlord under the Master Lease. Subject to Landlord s consent, the waiver of subrogation contained in Section 10.5 of the Master Lease shall be deemed to be modified to constitute an agreement by and among and apply to Landlord, Sublandlord and Subtenant. 

(vi) Representations and Warranties . Sublandlord shall not be deemed to have made or adopted as its own any representations or warranties made by Landlord in the Master Lease, except to the extent the relevant provision of the Master Lease is incorporated or as otherwise stated herein.

7. Assignment and Subletting . Subtenant shall not assign this Sublease or further sublet all or any part of the Subleased Premises except subject to and in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Master Lease, and Sublandlord (in addition to Landlord) shall have the same rights with respect to assignment and subleasing as Landlord has under the Master Lease. Subtenant shall pay all fees and costs payable to Landlord pursuant to the Master Lease in 

9 

as well as all of Sublandlord s reasonable, actual out-of-pocket costs paid to third parties relating to any proposed assignment, sub-sublease or transfer of the Subleased Premises regardless of whether any required consent is granted, and the effectiveness of any such consent shall be conditioned upon Landlord s and Sublandlord s receipt of all such fees and costs. Subject nevertheless to Landlord s consent, Subtenant shall be entitled to the Permitted Transfer rights set forth in Section 14.8 of the Master Lease, as incorporated herein, upon and subject to the terms and conditions thereof and hereof. 

8. Default . It shall constitute a Default hereunder if Subtenant fails to perform any obligation hereunder (including, without limitation, the obligation to pay Rent), or any obligation under the Master Lease which has been incorporated herein by reference, and, in each instance, Subtenant has not remedied such failure (a) in the case of any monetary Default, three (3) business days after delivery of written notice, (b) in the case Subtenant s failure to observe or perform according to the provisions of Articles 5, 14, 17 or 18 of the Master Lease, in each instance, one (1) business day after delivery of written notice, and (c) in the case of any other Default (except where a specific time period is otherwise set forth for Subtenant s performance in this Sublease, in which event the failure to perform by Subtenant within such time period shall be a Default hereunder), twenty (20) calendar days after delivery of written notice; provided, however, that if the nature of such Default is such that the same cannot reasonably be cured within such twenty (20) day period, Subtenant shall not be deemed to be in Default if it diligently commences such cure within such period and thereafter diligently proceeds to rectify and cure the same; however, if at any time Sublandlord receives notice from Landlord that the Default will be treated as a Default under the Master Lease, Subtenant s cure period will immediately be deemed to expire ten (10) days before the date of expiration of Sublandlord s cure period as set forth in Landlord s notice of default to Sublandlord, provided that such cure period will be extended by one (1) day for each day after the third (3rd) business day following the date on which Sublandlord received Landlord s notice that Sublandlord fails to deliver a copy thereof to Subtenant. 

9. Remedies . In the event of any Default hereunder by Subtenant, Sublandlord shall have all remedies provided to the Landlord in the Master Lease as if a default had occurred thereunder and all other rights and remedies otherwise available at law and in equity. Sublandlord may resort to its remedies cumulatively or in the alternative. 

10. Right to Cure Defaults . If Subtenant is in Default hereunder due to its failure to perform any of its obligations under this Sublease after expiration of applicable grace or cure periods, then Sublandlord may, but shall not be obligated to, perform any such obligations for Subtenant s account. All reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sublandlord in performing any such act for the account of Subtenant shall be deemed Rent payable by Subtenant to Sublandlord within thirty (30) days of demand (with reasonable backup documentation), together with interest thereon at the lesser of (a) twelve percent (12 per annum or (b) the maximum rate allowable under law from the date of the expenditure until repaid. If Sublandlord undertakes to perform any of Subtenant s obligations for the account of Subtenant pursuant hereto, the taking of such action shall not constitute a waiver of any of Sublandlord s remedies. Subtenant hereby expressly waives its rights under any statute to make repairs at the expense of Sublandlord. 

11. Consents, Approvals, and Notices . In any instance when Sublandlord s consent or approval is required under this Sublease, Sublandlord s refusal to consent to or approve 

10 

any matter or thing shall be deemed reasonable if, among other matters, such consent or approval is required under the provisions of the Master Lease incorporated herein by reference but has not been obtained from Landlord. Except as otherwise provided herein, Sublandlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to or approval of a matter if such consent or approval is required under the provisions of the Master Lease and Landlord has consented to or approved of such matter. In the event that Sublandlord delivers or receives a notice of default under the Master Lease which reasonably could be expected to impact Subtenant s occupancy, Sublandlord agrees to promptly deliver a copy thereof to Subtenant. 

If, at any time during the Term, Sublandlord receives any notice or demand from Landlord under the Master Lease which applies specifically to the Subleased Premises (as opposed to the Master Lease Premises generally), Sublandlord shall promptly deliver a true and correct copy of same to Subtenant (unless it is clear from the notice that a simultaneous notice has been sent by Landlord to Subtenant). 
 12. Liability . 

(a) Limitation of Liability . Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Sublease, the liability of Sublandlord to Subtenant for any default in Sublandlord s obligations under this Sublease shall be limited to actual, direct damages, and under no circumstances shall Subtenant, its partners, members, shareholders, directors, agents, officers, employees, contractors, sublessees, successors and/or assigns be entitled to recover from Sublandlord (or otherwise be indemnified by Sublandlord) for (i) any losses, costs, claims, causes of action, damages or other liability incurred in connection with a failure of Landlord, its partners, members, shareholders, directors, agents, officers, employees, contractors, successors and /or assigns to perform or cause to be performed Landlord s obligations under the Master Lease, (ii) lost revenues, lost profit or other consequential, special or punitive damages arising in connection with this Sublease for any reason, or (iii) any damages or other liability arising from or incurred in connection with the condition of the Subleased Premises or suitability of the Subleased Premises for Subtenant s intended uses. Subtenant shall, however, have the right to seek any injunctive or other equitable remedies as may be available to Subtenant under applicable law.

Subtenant will submit all such information for Sublandlord s review and written approval prior to commencement of any such work; Sublandlord will similarly promptly submit such plans to Landlord for review and approval.

(ii) Code-Required Work .

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Subtenant shall surrender the FF E to Sublandlord in as good condition and repair as on the Commencement Date, normal wear and tear excepted. Subtenant may, at Subtenant s sole cost and expense, remove items of the FF E from the Subleased Premises during the Term, provided that Subtenant: (a) first provides Sublandlord with prior written notice Subtenant s Notice thereof, which Subtenant s Notice shall include a description of those items of the FF E which Subtenant wishes to remove; and (b) at its sole cost and expense, stores such FF E in a secure, offsite location and returns the same to the Subleased Premises upon the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Sublease.

Secured Parties rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Collateral Trustee has all rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. Any Secured Party s exercise of one right or remedy is not an election and shall not preclude any Secured Party from exercising any other remedy under this Agreement or other remedy available at law or in equity, and any waiver of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Any delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence. 

9.8 Demand Waiver . Each Loan Party waives presentment, demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments or chattel paper.

 (d) Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for damages solely caused by its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent: (i) may consult with legal counsel, independent chartered accountants and other experts and consultants selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants, experts or consultants; (ii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (iii) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents on the part of any Loan Party or to inspect the Collateral (including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (iv) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (v) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by email, telecopy, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

Administrative Agent and each of its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any of their Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities of any Loan Party or any such Affiliate, all as if Administrative Agent was not Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from any Loan Party for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 

(f) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender, made its own credit and financial analysis of the Loan Parties and its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

 (h) Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof to Lenders, Collateral Trustee and Borrower Representative. Upon any such resignation, Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent that may be the Collateral Trustee. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after Administrative Agent s giving notice of resignation, then Administrative Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender or the Collateral Trustee, if a Lender or Collateral Trustee is willing to accept such appointment, or otherwise shall be a commercial bank or financial institution or a subsidiary of a commercial bank or financial institution if such commercial bank or financial institution has combined capital of at least 300,000,000. If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing, by the 30th day after the date such notice of resignation was given by the resigning Administrative Agent, such resignation shall become effective and Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent. Upon the earlier of the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent or the effective date of the resigning Administrative Agent s resignation, the resigning Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except that any indemnity, expense reimbursement or other rights in favor of such resigning Administrative Agent shall continue. After any resigning Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.18 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as K2 HealthVentures LLC is a Lender pursuant to this Agreement, K2 HealthVentures LLC shall not resign as Administrative Agent unless a successor Administrative Agent is appointed concurrently with such resignation, which successor Administrative Agent shall have the wherewithal to perform, and shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 

(i) In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, with the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, each Lender and each holder of any Obligation is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Loan Party or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all balances held by it at any of its offices for the account of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Loan Party or such Subsidiary) and any other properties or assets any time held or owing by that Lender or that holder to or for the credit or for the account of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party against and on account of any of the Obligations which are not paid when due. Any Lender or holder of any Obligation exercising a right to set off or otherwise receiving any payment on account of the Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement relating to the priority of the repayment of the Obligations shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders or holders shall sell) such participations in each such other Lender s or holder s Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to share the amount so set off or otherwise received with each other Lender or holder in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement relating to the priority of the repayment of the Obligations. Each Loan Party agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any Lender or holder may exercise its right to set off with respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations and may sell participations in such amount so set off to other Lenders and holders and (ii) any Lender or holders so purchasing a participation in the Loans made or other Obligations held by other Lenders or holders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers Lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender or holder were a direct holder of the Loans and the other Obligations in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all or any portion of the set-off amount or payment otherwise received is thereafter recovered from Lender that has exercised the right of set-off, the purchase of participations by that Lender shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored without interest. 

(j) Nothing in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to require Administrative Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill

 its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrowers may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. To the extent that Administrative Agent advances funds to Borrowers on behalf of any Lender and is not reimbursed therefor on the same Business Day as such advance is made, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to retain for its account all interest accrued on such advance until reimbursed by the applicable Lender. 

(k) If Administrative Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Administrative Agent from Borrowers and such related payment is not received thereby, then Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. 

(l) If Administrative Agent determines at any time that any amount received thereby under this Agreement shall be returned to Borrowers or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to Administrative Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Administrative Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Administrative Agent is required to pay to Borrowers or such other Person, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. 

(m) Administrative Agent will use reasonable efforts to provide Lenders with any written notice of Event of Default received by Administrative Agent from, or delivered by Administrative Agent to, any Loan Party; provided , however , that Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any Lender for any failure to do so, except to the extent that such failure is attributable solely to Administrative Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

(n) Anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender and with Administrative Agent that no Lender shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including exercising any rights of set-off) without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, it being the intent of Lenders that any such action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of Administrative Agent at the request of Required Lenders.

13.6 Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations .

(g) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Agreement. 

(h) To the extent applicable, the ISR Guarantor waives the benefits and any rights afforded to it under the Israeli Guaranty Law, 5727-1967, as may be amended from time to time (the Guaranty Law ), and including any successor law or similar applicable law of a non-Israeli jurisdiction which defenses or rights would have been available to the undersigned and the ISR Guarantor hereby confirms that such rights and defenses set forth in the Guaranty Law, shall not apply to the ISR Guarantor, including but not limited to Sections 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 thereto.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8 , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 8 the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 8 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

 additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Recipient for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender and delivered to the Borrower Representative, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Loan Parties shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 

10. Survival . Each party s obligations under the provisions of this Schedule 3 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or Collateral Trustee or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

11. Tax Treatment . Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties hereto agree to treat the Loans, for U.S. federal income tax purpose, as a convertible debt instrument that is not subject to the application of the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-4.

 The undersigned hereby acknowledges and is advised of the following Interpretation A.65 of the July 1997 SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations regarding short selling: 
 An Issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock against the box and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date. The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the registration statement become effective, because the shares underlying the short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would, therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold prior to the effective date. 
 By returning this Questionnaire, the undersigned will be deemed to be aware of the foregoing interpretation. 
 I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the foregoing statements (including without limitation the answers to this Questionnaire) are correct.

Capitalization Adjustments, the Company will seek stockholder approval of any amendment of this Plan that (A) materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan, (B) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under this Plan, (C) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under this Plan, (D) materially reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be issued or purchased under this Plan, (E) materially extends the term of this Plan, or (F) materially expands the types of Awards available for issuance under this Plan. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan (including subsection (viii) below) or an Award Document, no amendment of this Plan will materially impair a Participant s rights under an outstanding Award without the Participant s written consent. 
 (vii) To submit any amendment to this Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to this Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule, if applicable. 
 
 (viii) To approve forms of Award Documents for use under this Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more outstanding Awards, including, but not limited to, amendments to provide terms more favorable to the Participant than previously provided in the Award Documents for such Awards. A Participant s rights under any Award will not be impaired by any such amendment unless the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and the Participant consents in writing. However, a Participant s rights will not be deemed to have been impaired by any such amendment if the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that the amendment, taken as a whole, does not materially impair the Participant s rights. In addition, subject to the limitations of applicable law, if any, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards without the affected Participant s consent (A) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code or (B) to comply with other applicable laws or listing requirements. 
 (ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company and that are not in conflict with the provisions of this Plan and/or Award Documents. 
 (x) To adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate (A) to permit or facilitate participation in this Plan by persons eligible to receive Awards under this Plan who are not citizens of, subject to taxation by, or employed outside, the United States or (B) to allow Awards to qualify for special tax treatment in a jurisdiction other than the United States. Board approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to this Plan or any Award Document that are required for compliance with the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. 
 (xi) To effect, with the consent of any adversely affected Participant, (A) the reduction of the exercise, purchase or strike price of any outstanding Stock Award; (B) the cancellation of any outstanding Stock Award and the grant in substitution therefore of a new (1) Option or SAR, (2) Restricted Stock Award, (3) Restricted Stock Unit Award, (4) cash award and/or (5) award of other valuable consideration determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, with any such substituted award (x) covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock as the cancelled Stock Award and (y) granted under this Plan or another equity or compensatory plan of the Company; or (C) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles. 
 (c) Delegation to Committee . 
 (i) General . The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of this Plan to a Committee or Committees, except that the Board s authority under Section 2(b)(i) above may only be delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board. If administration of this Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection with the administration of this Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee). Any delegation of administrative powers will be reflected in the charter of the Committee to which the delegation is made, or resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, adopted from time to time by the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Committee may, at any time, abolish the subcommittee and/or revest in the Committee any powers delegated to any subcommittee. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, delegation of authority by the Board to a Committee, or to an Officer or employee pursuant to Section 2(d) , does not limit the authority of the Board, which may continue to exercise any authority so delegated and may concurrently administer this Plan with the Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. 

(ii) Rule 16b-3 Compliance . The Committee may consist solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 
 (d) Delegation to an Officer . The Board (or a Committee, if within the scope of the Committee s delegated authority) may delegate to one (1) or more Officers the day to day administration of the Plan, and such administrator(s) may have the authority to execute and distribute agreements or other documents evidencing or relating to Awards granted under this Plan, to maintain records relating to the grant, vesting, exercise, forfeiture, or expiration of Awards, to process or oversee the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise, vesting, and/or settlement of an Award, to interpret the terms of Awards and to take such other actions as the Board may specify. 
 (e) Effect of Board s Decision . All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board (or a duly authorized Committee, subcommittee or Officer exercising powers delegated by the Board under this Section 2 in good faith will not be subject to review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 

3. 
 SHARES SUBJECT TO THIS PLAN. 

(a) Share Reserve . 
 (i) Subject to Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards from and after the Effective Date will not exceed 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock (the Share Reserve ). 
 (ii) For clarity, the Share Reserve is a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under this Plan. As a single share may be subject to grant more than once (e.g., if a share subject to a Stock Award is forfeited, it may be made subject to grant again as provided in Section 3(b) below), the Share Reserve is not a limit on the number of Stock Awards that can be granted. 
 (b) Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve . If a Stock Award or any portion of a Stock Award (i) expires, is cancelled or forfeited or otherwise terminates without all of the shares covered by the Stock Award having been issued or (ii) is settled in cash (i.e., the Participant receives cash rather than stock), such expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, termination or settlement will not reduce (or otherwise offset) the number of shares of Common Stock that are available for issuance under this Plan. If any shares of Common Stock issued under a Stock Award are forfeited back to, reacquired at no cost by, or repurchased at cost by the Company, whether or not because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition required to vest such shares in the Participant, then the shares that are forfeited, reacquired or repurchased will revert to and again become available for issuance under this Plan. Any shares retained and not issued by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on a Stock Award or as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award will not reduce (or otherwise offset) the number of shares of Common Stock that are available for issuance under this Plan. Any shares reacquired by the Company (as distinguished from being retained without issuance by the Company) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on a Stock Award, as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award, or with the proceeds paid by the Participant under the terms of a Stock Award, will again become available for issuance under this Plan. Under all circumstances, the Share Reserve shall only be reduced upon the issuance of shares covered by a Stock Award. 
 (c) Source of Shares . The stock issuable under this Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise or shares classified as treasury shares. 

4. 
 ELIGIBILITY. 

Awards under the Plan may be granted only to New Employees who satisfy the standards for inducement grants under the Listing Rule, and only when the Award is an inducement material to the individual s entering into employment with the Company within the meaning of the Listing Rule. 

5. 
 PROVISIONS RELATING TO OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. 

Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. All Options will be granted as Nonstatutory Stock Options. The provisions of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Document will conform to (through incorporation of 

provisions hereof by reference in the applicable Award Document or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: 
 (a) Term . No Option or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Document. 
 (b) Exercise Price . The exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will be not less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike price lower than 100 of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Award if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a corporate transaction and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and, if applicable, Section 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents. 
 (c) Purchase Price for Options . The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option may be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below. The Board will have the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to use a particular method of payment. The purchase price shall be denominated in U.S. dollars. The permitted methods of payment are as follows: 
 (i) by cash, check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company; 
 (ii) pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the United States Federal Reserve Board or a successor regulation, or a similar rule in a foreign jurisdiction of domicile of a Participant, that, prior to or contemporaneously with the issuance of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the proceeds of sale of such stock; 
 
 (iii) by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock; 
 (iv) by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued. Shares of Common Stock will no longer be subject to an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares issuable upon exercise are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the net exercise, (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or 
 (v) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Document. 
 (d) Exercise and Payment of a SAR . To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Appreciation Right Award Document evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such SAR (with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date), over (B) the aggregate strike price of the number of Common Stock equivalents with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date. The appreciation distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Award Document evidencing such SAR. 
 (e) Transferability of Options and SARs . The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on the transferability of Options and SARs as the Board determines. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply: 
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer . An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below), and will be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. The Board may permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner that is 

not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration. 
 (ii) Domestic Relations Orders . Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to the terms of a domestic relations order, official marital settlement agreement or other divorce or separation instrument as permitted by applicable law. 
 
 (iii) Beneficiary Designation . Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form approved by the Company (or the designated broker), designate a third party who, on the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or administrator of the Participant s estate will be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a beneficiary at any time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of applicable laws. 
 (f) Vesting Generally . The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of performance goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options or SARs may vary. The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing the minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to which an Option or SAR may be exercised. 
 (g) Termination of Continuous Service . Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant s death or Disability), the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) within the period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service and (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Document. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame, the Option or SAR will terminate. 
 (h) Extension of Termination Date . Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant s death or Disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a total period of three (3) months (that need not be consecutive) after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of such registration requirements, and (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Document. In addition, unless otherwise provided in a Participant s applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if the sale of any Common Stock received upon exercise of an 
 Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (other than for Cause) would violate the Company s insider trading policy, and the Company does not waive the potential violation of the policy or otherwise permit the sale, or allow the Participant to surrender shares of Common Stock to the Company in satisfaction of any exercise price and/or any withholding obligations under Section 9(h) , then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a period of months (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post-termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service during which the sale of the Common Stock received upon exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of the Company s insider trading policy, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Document. 
 (i) Disability of Participant . Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of Continuous Service), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous 

Service, and (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Document. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame, the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate. 
 (j) Death of Participant . Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if (i) a Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s death, or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in this Plan or the applicable Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, for exercisability after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (for a reason other than death), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of death) by the Participant s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participant s death, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date 18 months following the date of death, and (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Document. If, after the Participant s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the applicable time frame, the Option or SAR will terminate. 
 (k) Termination for Cause . Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant s Award Document or other individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Participant s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or SAR will terminate upon the date on which the event giving rise to the termination for Cause first occurred, and the Participant will be prohibited from exercising his or her Option or SAR from and after the date on which the event giving rise to the termination for Cause first occurred (or, if required by law, the date of termination of Continuous Service). If a Participant s Continuous Service is suspended pending an investigation of the existence of Cause, all of the Participant s rights under the Option or SAR will also be suspended during the investigation period. 
 
 (l) Non-Exempt Employees . If an Option or SAR is granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, the Option or SAR will not be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least 6 months following the date of grant of the Option or SAR (although the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the U.S. Worker Economic Opportunity Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Change in Control in which such Option or SAR is not assumed, continued, or substituted, or (iii) upon the non-exempt Employee s retirement (as such term may be defined in the non-exempt Employee s applicable Award Document, in another agreement between the non-exempt Employee and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with the Company s then current employment policies and guidelines), the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than 6 months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt Employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or required for compliance with the U.S. Worker Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt Employee in connection with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from such employee s regular rate of pay, the provisions of this paragraph will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Documents. 

6. 
 PROVISIONS OF STOCK AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS AND SARS. 

(a) Restricted Stock Awards . Each Restricted Stock Award Document will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. To the extent consistent with the Company s bylaws, at the Board s election, shares of Common Stock may be (x) held in book entry form subject to the Company s instructions until any restrictions relating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse, or (y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Award Documents may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award Documents need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Award Document will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: 
 (i) Consideration . A Restricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company or (B) any other form of legal consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law. 

(ii) Vesting . Shares of Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Document may be subject to forfeiture to the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Board. 
 (iii) Termination of Participant s Continuous Service . If a Participant s Continuous Service terminates, the Company may receive through a forfeiture condition or a repurchase right, any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant that have not vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Document. 
 
 (iv) Transferability . Common Stock issued pursuant to an Award, and rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Document, will be transferable by the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Document, as the Board determines in its sole discretion, so long as such Common Stock remains subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Document. 
 (v) Dividends . Any dividends paid on Restricted Stock will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture restrictions as apply to the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award to which they relate. 
 (b) Restricted Stock Unit Awards . Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Document will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Documents may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Documents need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Document will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: 
 (i) Consideration . At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be paid by the Participant upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law. 
 (ii) Vesting . At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
 (iii) Payment . A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any combination thereof or in any other form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Document. 
 (iv) Additional Restrictions . At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board, as it deems appropriate, may impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award. 
 (v) Dividend Equivalents . Dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares of Common Stock covered by a Restricted Stock Unit Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Document. At the sole discretion of the Board, such dividend equivalents may be converted into additional shares of Common Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award in such manner as determined by the Board. Any dividend equivalents and/or additional shares covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents will be subject to all of the same terms and conditions of the underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award Document to which they relate. 
 
 (vi) Termination of Participant s Continuous Service . Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant s termination of Continuous Service. 
 (c) Performance Awards . 
 (i) Performance Stock Awards . A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of the achievement of certain performance goals. A Performance Stock Award may, but need not, require the 

completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the performance goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such performance goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee, the Board, or an authorized Officer, in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Document, the Board may determine that cash may be used in payment of Performance Stock Awards. 
 (ii) Board Discretion . The Committee, the Board, or an authorized Officer, as the case may be, retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due upon attainment of performance goals and to define the manner of calculating the performance criteria it selects to use for a Performance Period. 

7. 
 COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. 

(a) Availability of Shares . The Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy then-outstanding Stock Awards. 
 (b) Securities Law Compliance . The Company will seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over this Plan such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities Act this Plan, any Stock Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under this Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent issuance of cash or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities law. 
 (c) No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes . The Company will have no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such holder as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. The Company has no duty or obligation to, and does not undertake to, provide tax advice or to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award. 

8. 
 MISCELLANEOUS. 

(a) Use of Proceeds from Sales of Common Stock . Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Stock Awards will constitute general funds of the Company. 
 (b) Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Awards . Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any Participant will be deemed completed as of the latest date that all necessary corporate action has occurred and all material terms of the Award (including, in the case of stock options, the exercise price thereof) are fixed, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the documentation evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually received or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g., exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Document as a result of a clerical error in the papering of the Award Document, the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in the Award Document. 
 (c) Stockholder Rights . No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance of shares of Common Stock under, the Stock Award pursuant to its terms, and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Stock Award has been entered into the books and records of the Company. 
 (d) No Employment or Other Service Rights . Nothing in this Plan, any Award Document or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Award granted pursuant thereto will confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award 

was granted or any other capacity or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate the Participant s employment or other service with or without notice and with or without cause, including, but not limited to, Cause. 
 
 (e) Change in Time Commitment . In the event a Participant s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services for the Company and any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the Employee has a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee or takes an extended leave of absence), or the Participant s role or primary responsibilities are changed to a level that, in the Board s determination does not justify the Participant s unvested Awards, and such reduction or change occurs after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the Board has the right in its sole discretion to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the event of any such reduction, the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced or extended. 
 (f) Investment Assurances . The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any Stock Award, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award, and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inoperative if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of a Stock Award or acquisition of Common Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under this Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock. 
 
 (g) Withholding Obligations . Unless prohibited or restricted by the terms of an Award Document, the Company may, in its sole discretion, satisfy any national, state, local or other tax withholding obligation relating to an Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a cash payment; (ii) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in connection with the Award (only up to the amount permitted that will not cause an adverse accounting consequence or cost); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant, including proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Stock Award; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Document. 
 (h) Electronic Delivery or Notice . Any reference herein to a written agreement, document, or notice will include any agreement, document, or notice delivered electronically (including via the website of a designated broker), filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto), or posted on the Company s intranet (or other shared electronic medium controlled by the Company to which the Participant has access). 
 (i) Deferrals . To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may be deferred and may establish programs and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code (to the extent applicable to a Participant). Consistent with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise providing services to the Company. The Board is authorized to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant s termination of Continuous Service, and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of this Plan and in accordance with applicable law. 

(j) Compliance with Section 409A . Unless otherwise expressly provided for in an Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, this Plan and Award Documents will be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes this Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to an Award, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted hereunder is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award Document evidencing such Award will incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to the extent an Award Document is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan (and unless the Award Document specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the Participant is otherwise subject to Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a separation from service (as defined in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death, unless such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred will be paid in a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule. 
 
 (k) Clawback/Recovery . All Awards granted under this Plan will be subject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Company s securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In addition, the Board may impose such other clawback, recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Document as the Board determines necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of Common Stock or other cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause. No recovery of compensation under such a clawback policy will be an event giving rise to a right to resign for good reason or constructive termination (or similar term) under any agreement with the Company or an Affiliate. 

9. 
 ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN COMMON STOCK; OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. 

(a) Capitalization Adjustments . In the event of a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to this Plan pursuant to Section 3(a) ; and (ii) the class(es) and number of securities or other property and value (including price per share of stock) subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determination will be final, binding and conclusive. 
 (b) Dissolution or Liquidation . Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Document, or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to a forfeiture condition or the Company s right of repurchase) will terminate immediately prior to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company s repurchase rights or subject to a forfeiture condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing Continuous Service; provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested, exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expired or terminated) before the dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion. 
 (c) Change in Control . The following provisions will apply to Awards in the event of a Change in Control unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award or any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant or unless otherwise expressly provided by the Board at the time of grant of an Award. In the event of a Change in Control, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board will take one or more of the following actions with respect to each outstanding Award, contingent upon the closing or completion of the Change in Control: 
 (i) arrange for the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation s parent company) to assume or continue the Award or to substitute a similar award for the Award 

(including, but not limited to, an award to acquire the same consideration per share paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Change in Control); 
 
 (ii) arrange for the assignment of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Award to the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation s parent company); 
 (iii) accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of the Award (and, if applicable, the time at which the Award may be exercised) to a date prior to the effective time of such Change in Control as the Board will determine (or, if the Board will not determine such a date, to the date that is 5 days prior to the effective date of the Change in Control), with such Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, and with such exercise reversed if the Change in Control does not become effective; 
 (iv) arrange for the lapse, in whole or in part, of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to the Award; 
 (v) cancel or arrange for the cancellation of the Award, to the extent not vested or not exercised prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, in exchange for such cash consideration, if any, as the Board, in its reasonable determination, may consider appropriate as an approximation of the value of the canceled Award, taking into account the value of the Common Stock subject to the canceled Award, the possibility that the Award might not otherwise vest in full, and such other factors as the Board deems relevant; and 
 (vi) cancel or arrange for the cancellation of the Award, to the extent not vested or not exercised prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, in exchange for a payment, in such form as may be determined by the Board equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the value in the Change in Control of the property the Participant would have received upon the exercise of the Award immediately prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, over (B) any exercise price payable by such holder in connection with such exercise. 
 The Board need not take the same action or actions with respect to all Awards or portions thereof or with respect to all Participants. The Board may take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an Award. 
 In the absence of any affirmative determination by the Board at the time of a Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be assumed or an equivalent Award will be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation (the Successor Corporation ), unless the Successor Corporation does not agree to assume the Award or to substitute an equivalent Award, in which case the vesting of such Award will accelerate in its entirety (along with, if applicable, the time at which the Award may be exercised) to a date prior to the effective time of such Change in Control as the Board will determine (or, if the Board will not determine such a date, to the date that is 5 days prior to the effective date of the Change in Control), with such Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, and with such exercise reversed if the Change in Control does not become effective. 
 
 (d) Acceleration of Awards upon a Change in Control . An Award may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a Change in Control as may be provided in the Award Document for such Award or as may be provided in any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, but in the absence of such provision, no such acceleration will occur. 

10. 
 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THIS PLAN. 

The Board or the Compensation Committee may suspend or terminate this Plan at any time. This Plan will have no fixed expiration date. No Awards may be granted under this Plan while this Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. 

11. 
 EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN. 

The 89bio, Inc. 2023 Inducement Plan originally came into existence on the Effective Date and this Plan, as most recently amended and restated, became effective as of September 23, 2024. 

12. 
 CHOICE OF LAW. 

The laws of the State of Delaware will govern all questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Plan, without regard to that state s conflict of laws rules. 

13. 
 DEFINITIONS. 

As used in this Plan, the following definitions will apply to the capitalized terms indicated below: 
 (a) Affiliate means, at the time of determination, any parent or subsidiary of the Company, as such terms are defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. The Board will have the authority to determine the time or times at which parent or subsidiary status is determined within the foregoing definition.

 (c) Award Document means a written agreement between the Company and a Participant, or a written notice issued by the Company to a Participant, evidencing the terms and conditions of an Award. 
 (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 (e) Capitalization Adjustment means any change that is made in, or other events that occur with respect to, the Common Stock subject to this Plan or subject to any Stock Award after the Effective Date without the receipt of consideration by the Company through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, large nonrecurring cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other similar equity restructuring transaction, as that term is used in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company will not be treated as a Capitalization Adjustment. 
 (f) Cause will have the meaning ascribed to such term in any written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Affiliate defining such term and, in the absence of such agreement, such term means, with respect to a Participant, the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Participant s failure substantially to perform his or her duties and responsibilities to the Company or any Affiliate or violation of a policy of the Company or any Affiliate; (ii) Participant s commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in injury to the Company or any Affiliate; (iii) unauthorized use or disclosure by Participant of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom the Participant owes an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of his or her relationship with the Company or any Affiliate; or (iv) Participant s breach of any of his or her obligations under any written agreement or covenant with the Company or any Affiliate. The determination as to whether a Participant is being terminated for Cause will be made in good faith by the Company and will be final and binding on the Participant. Any determination by the Company that the Continuous Service of a Participant was terminated with or without Cause for the purposes of outstanding Awards held by such Participant will have no effect upon any determination of the rights or obligations of the Company, any Affiliate or such Participant for any other purpose. 
 (g) Change in Control means the occurrence, in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the following events: 
 (i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50 of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company directly from the Company, (B) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Company s securities in a transaction or series of related transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities or (C) solely because the level of Ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the Subject Person exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acquisition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares outstanding, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the 

Company, and after such share acquisition, the Subject Person becomes the Owner of any additional voting securities that, assuming the repurchase or other acquisition had not occurred, increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities Owned by the Subject Person over the designated percentage threshold, then a Change in Control will be deemed to occur; 
 (ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and, immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior thereto do not Own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting securities representing 50 or more of the combined outstanding voting power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) 50 or more of the combined outstanding voting power of the parent of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; 
 (iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than a sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to an Entity, more than 50 of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are Owned by stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such sale, lease, license or other disposition; or 
 (iv) individuals who, on the Effective Date, are members of the Board (the Incumbent Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for election) of any new Board member was approved or recommended by a majority vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing definition or any other provision of this Plan, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other transaction effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or any analogous term is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply. 
 
 If required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such transaction is not also a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company as determined under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant s consent, amend the definition of Change in Control to conform to the definition of Change in Control under Section 409A of the Code, and the regulations thereunder. 
 (h) Code means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder. 
 (i) Committee means a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with Section 2(c) . 
 (j) Compensation Committee means the Compensation Committee of the Board. 
 (k) Common Stock means the common stock of the Company. 
 (l) Company 89bio, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 
 (m) Consultant means any person, including an advisor, who is (i) engaged by the Company or an Affiliate to render consulting or advisory services and is compensated for such services, or (ii) serving as a member of the board of directors of an Affiliate and is compensated for such services. However, service solely as a Director, or payment of a fee for such service, will not cause a Director to be considered a Consultant for purposes of this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person is treated as a Consultant under this Plan only if a Form Registration Statement on Form S-8 or a successor form under the Securities Act is available to register either the offer or the sale of the Company s securities to such person. 

(n) Continuous Service means that the Participant s service with the Company or an Affiliate, whether as an Employee, Director or Consultant, is not interrupted or terminated. A change in the capacity in which the Participant renders service to the Company or an Affiliate as an Employee, Consultant or Director or a change in the Entity for which the Participant renders such service, provided that there is no interruption or termination of the Participant s service with the Company or an Affiliate, will not terminate a Participant s Continuous Service. For example, a change in status from an Employee of the Company to a Consultant of an Affiliate or to a Director will not constitute an interruption of Continuous Service. If the Entity for which a Participant is rendering services ceases to qualify as an Affiliate, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, such Participant s Continuous Service will be considered to have terminated on the date such Entity ceases to qualify as an Affiliate. To the extent permitted by law, the Board or the chief executive officer of the Company, in that party s sole discretion, may determine whether Continuous Service will be considered interrupted in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Board or chief executive officer, including sick leave, military leave or any other personal leave, or (ii) transfers between the Company, an Affiliate, or their successors. In addition, if required for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the determination of whether there has been a termination of Continuous Service will be made, and such term will be construed, in a manner that is consistent with the definition of separation from service as defined under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder). A leave of absence will be treated as Continuous Service for purposes of vesting in a Stock Award only to such extent as may be provided in the applicable Award Document, the Company s leave of absence policy, in the written terms of any leave of absence agreement or policy applicable to the Participant, or as otherwise required by law. 
 
 (o) Director means a member of the Board. 
 (p) Disability means, with respect to a Participant, the inability of such Participant to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months as provided in Sections 22(e)(3) and 409A(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Code, and will be determined by the Board on the basis of such medical evidence as the Board deems warranted under the circumstances. 
 (q) Effective Date means February 9, 2023. 
 (r) Employee means any person providing services as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate. For avoidance of doubt, service solely as a Director or Consultant, or payment of a fee for such services, will not cause a Director or Consultant to be considered an Employee for purposes of this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who already is serving as a Director prior to becoming an Employee will not be eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan unless permitted under the Listing Rule. 
 (s) Entity means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity. 
 (t) Exchange Act means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 (v) Fair Market Value means, as of any date, the value of the Common Stock determined as follows: 
 (i) If the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange or traded on any established market, the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of any date of determination will be, unless otherwise determined by the Board, the closing sales price for such stock as quoted on such exchange or market (or the exchange or market with the greatest volume of trading in the Common Stock) on the date of determination, as reported in a source the Board deems reliable. 

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Board, if there is no closing sales price for the Common Stock on the date of determination, then the Fair Market Value will be the closing selling price on the last preceding date for which such quotation exists. 
 (iii) In the absence of such markets for the Common Stock, the Fair Market Value will be determined by the Board in good faith and in a manner that complies with Sections 409A and 422 of the Code. 
 (w) Listing Rule means Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. 
 (x) New Employee means an Employee who commenced employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates on terms and conditions consistent with the Listing Rule.
