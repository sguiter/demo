The Company recorded net gains of and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net losses of and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to changes in the fair value of the Company s portfolio of equity securities during the applicable periods. Debt Securities Debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax.

The mortgage-backed securities in the Company s portfolio are government sponsored enterprise GSE pass-through instruments issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), which guarantees the timely payment of principal on these investments. ASC 326 made targeted changes to the accounting for credit losses on securities available for sale. The concept of other-than-temporarily impaired securities was replaced with the allowance for credit losses. Unlike held to maturity debt securities, available for sale securities are evaluated on an individual level and pooling of securities is not allowed. For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For debt securities available for sale that do not meet the criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the

 million in unfunded commitments and in anticipated credit losses in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. At December 31, 2023, the Company had million in unfunded commitments and in anticipated credit losses in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The reserve for unfunded commitments is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as opposed to in the ACL. Provisions to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are recorded as other noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The determination of the ACL is complex, and the Company makes decisions on the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Evaluations of the loan portfolio and individual credits require certain estimates, assumptions and judgements as to the facts and circumstances related to particular situations or credits. There may be significant changes in the ACL in future periods determined by factors prevailing at that point in time along with future forecasts.

 of the appraised value of the property and are typically secured by personal guarantees of the borrowers. As economic conditions deteriorate, the Company reduces its exposure in real estate loans with higher risk characteristics. In underwriting these loans, the Company performs a thorough analysis of the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower s credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property securing the loan. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are performed by independent appraisers. Real estate - commercial loans generally present a higher level of risk than certain other types of loans, particularly during slow economic conditions. Real Estate - Construction Lending: The Company engages in real estate - construction lending in its primary market area and surrounding areas. The Company s real estate - construction lending consists of 1-4 family residential construction loans and other construction loans, which are construction loans for purposes other than constructing 1-4 family residential properties such as land development and commercial building construction loans. The Company s 1-4 family residential construction loans are loans for constructing 1-4 family residential properties, which will secure the loan. Other construction loans are generally secured with the subject property, and advances are made in

 -years for both permanent structures and those under construction. The Company s 1-4 family residential mortgage originations are secured primarily by properties located in its primary market area and surrounding areas. Most of the Company s residential real estate - mortgage loans originate with a loan-to-value of or less. Home equity installment loans are secured by the borrower s primary residence with a maximum loan-to-value of and a maximum term of 15 years . Home equity lines of credit are secured by the borrower s primary residence with a maximum loan-to-value of and a maximum term of 20 years . In underwriting 1-4 family residential real estate loans, the Company evaluates the borrower s ability to make monthly payments, the borrower s repayment history and the value of the property securing the loan. The ability to repay is determined by the borrower s employment history, current financial conditions and credit background. The analysis is based primarily on the customer s ability to repay and secondarily on the collateral or security. Most properties securing real estate loans made by the Company are appraised by independent fee appraisers. The Company generally requires mortgage loan borrowers to obtain an attorney s title opinion or title insurance and fire and property insurance (including flood insurance, if necessary) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. The Company does not engage in sub-prime residential mortgage originations. Residential mortgage loans and home equity loans generally present a lower level of risk than certain other types of consumer loans because they are secured by the borrower s primary residence. Risk is increased when the Company is in a subordinate position for the loan collateral. Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions: The Company lends to local municipalities and other tax-exempt organizations. These loans are primarily tax-anticipation notes and, as such, carry minimal risk. Historically, the Company has never had a loss on any loan of this type. Personal Lending: The Company offers a variety of secured and unsecured personal loans, including vehicle loans, mobile home loans and loans secured by savings deposits as well as other types of personal loans.

 consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Charge-offs will occur when a confirmed loss is identified. Professional appraisals of collateral, discounted for expected selling costs, appraisal age, economic conditions and other known factors, are used to determine the charge-off amount. Under ASC 326, loans that do not share risk characteristics are not evaluated collectively and are instead individually evaluated. When management determines foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Real estate - mortgage Total The following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans by class of loans and collateral type as of December 31, 2023. 

(Dollars in thousands) Real Estate Other Real estate - commercial Real estate - mortgage Total Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or reasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of principal or interest. However, it is the Company s policy to continue to accrue interest on loans over 90 days past due if (1) they are guaranteed or well secured and (2) there is an effective means of timely collection in process. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed against current period income, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for credit losses. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, accruals are resumed on loans only when the obligation is brought fully current with respect to interest and principal, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. The Company s nonaccrual and charge-off policies are the same, regardless of the loan type.

 (1) These loans are guaranteed, or well-secured, and there is an effective means of collection in process. 
 The decline in nonaccrual real estate commercial loans with no allowance for credit losses was due to the pay-off of a participated loan during the first quarter of 2024. The Company recognized in interest income on nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio is also monitored by analyzing the age of the loans receivable as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. Past due status is determined by the contractual terms of the loan.

 Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-then-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Company may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. There were no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 and, as such, there were no payment defaults on loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. If the Company determines a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on a continuing basis, with all such loans reviewed annually. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention - Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Loans in this category are reviewed no less than quarterly. Substandard - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans in this category are reviewed no less than monthly. Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, highly questionable and improbable based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loans in this category are reviewed no less than monthly. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass-rated loans.

As of September 30, 2024, there were 23.6 million of loans classified as special mention compared to 21.4 million at December 31, 2023, 1.8 million of loans classified as substandard at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.9 million at December 31, 2023, and 72,000 of loans classified as doubtful at September 30, 2024 compared to none at December 31, 2023. The increase in special mention loans between periods was primarily due to the downgrade of a commercial

 relationship, while the decline in substandard loans was primarily due to the pay-off of a participated real estate-commercial loan during the first quarter of 2024. Management believes the allowance for credit losses carried was adequate to cover forecasted expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024. Management also believes the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital to absorb losses that may occur but continues to closely monitor the financial strength of borrowers and their ability to comply with repayment terms. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or reasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of principal or interest. However, it is the Company s policy to continue to accrue interest on loans over 90 days past due if (1) they are guaranteed or well secured and (2) there is an effective means of timely collection in process. The following table summarizes the Bank s non-performing loans on September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

Allowance for Credit Losses ACL ): Juniata adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments as of January 1, 2023. The new current expected credit loss CECL model is based on forecasted economic scenarios as well as qualitative factors specific to Juniata. The ACL represents management s assessment of the estimated credit losses the Company will receive over the life of the loan. ACL requires a projection of credit losses over the contract lifetime of the credit adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Management analyzes the adequacy of the ACL regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio. Consideration is given to economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrowers ability to pay, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non-performing loan balances. The ACL is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for credit losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio. In addition to extensive in-house loan monitoring procedures, the Company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships. Management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL associated with these types of loans. 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 The ACL is made up of two basic components. The first component of the allowance for credit loss is the specific reserve in which the Company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual analyzed credits. In establishing specific reserves, the Company analyzes all substandard, doubtful and loss graded loans monthly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower, the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantors. If the loan is individually analyzed and cash flow dependent, then a specific reserve is established for the discount on the net present value of expected future cash flows. If the loan is individually analyzed and collateral dependent, then any shortfall is either charged off or a specific reserve is established. The Company also considers the impacts of any Small Business Administration guarantees. The specific reserve portion of the ACL was 70,000 at September 30, 2024 and 4,000 at December 31, 2023. The second component is a general reserve, which is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans for which the Company estimates the expected losses over the contractual lifetime of the loan, adjusted for prepayment tendencies. In addition, the future economic environment is incorporated into the projection with selected macro-economic variables to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can no longer make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. Discounted cash flows DCF was selected as the appropriate method to analyze the Company s loan segments because DCF allows for the effective incorporation of a reasonable and supportable forecast in a directionally consistent and objective manner. DCF generates cash flow projections at the instrument level where payment expectations are adjusted for prepayment and curtailment to produce an expected cash flow stream. This expected cash flow stream is compared to contractual cash flows to establish a valuation account for these loans. Additionally, the Company is using reasonable credit risk assumptions, based on an annual report produced by Moody s, for the obligations of states and political subdivisions segment. CECL requires a reasonable and supportable economic forecast when establishing the ACL. The Company estimates losses over a four quarter forecast period and has elected to revert historical loss experience over four quarters. The economic factors considered as part of the ACL were selected after a rigorous regression analysis and model selection process. The quantitative general allowance was 2.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 2.5 million at December 31, 2023. In addition to the quantitative analysis, a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to determine additional general reserves on loan portfolios that are not individually analyzed for various factors. The overall qualitative factors are based on the following risk factors: 1) Lending Policy, Procedures, Strategies - Changes in policy and/or underwriting standards as well as anticipated changes are considered, and a qualitative factor is applied in accordance with the magnitude and direction (loosening/tightening) of the change. In addition, any new loan programs are also taken into consideration when evaluating this factor. 2) Changes in Nature and Volume of the Portfolio - The composition of the Bank s loan portfolio is assessed to evaluate possible risk changes arising from new or increasing types of loans, industries or collateral. 3) Credit Lending Staff/Administration - The knowledge and experience of the lending and credit personnel is assessed. 4) Problem Loan Trends - The level of delinquency, modifications, and extensions is used to measure the trends of the risk changes within the portfolio. 5) Concentrations - As an extension of the portfolio composition review, lending concentrations are monitored regularly. Concentrations may be measured by collateral, type, industry and geographical location. 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 6) Loan Review Results - Loan reviews conducted internally as well as by outside auditors or examiners are studied for indications of possible risk changes. 7) Collateral Values - Changes in market values of the underlying collateral are monitored on select loan types and pools. Examples could include housing, CRE or cattle prices. These variations may indicate the need for risk adjustment as future loss levels could change if liquidation becomes necessary. 8) Regulatory and Business Environment - The impact of government fiscal and business policy as well as the regulatory environment are monitored and may result in possible adjustments to the risk factors. 
 In determining how to apply the weightings for the various qualitative factors, management considered which factors were not entirely considered within the base model and assessed which factors would have the highest impact on potential loan losses. Weights and risks are consistent across various segments except for instances where the risk factor is not applicable, or the segment is more or less exposed than other segments. Risk weighting is adjusted directionally based on relevancy and the ability to quantify an impact. For example, the economy and external factors were determined to have the most significant effect on the estimated losses largely because there is evidence that economic conditions are largely correlated and can explain a significant portion of historical changes in loss. Likewise, risks that are well-controlled throughout the organization, such as managerial contingencies and loan review controls require less allocation. The qualitative analysis resulted in a general reserve of 3.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.2 million at December 31, 2023. The determination of the ACL is complex, and the Company makes decisions on the effects of matter that are inherently uncertain. Evaluations of the loan portfolio and individual credits require certain estimates, assumptions and judgements as to the facts and circumstances related to particular situations or credits. There may be significant changes in the ACL in future periods determined by factors prevailing at that point in time along with future forecasts. Subsequent Event: On October 15, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.22 per share to shareholders of record on November 15, 2024, payable on November 29, 2024.

Net Interest Income: Net interest income was 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 115,000, or 2.0 , compared to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets increased 11.2 million, or 1.3 , to 853.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of 30.2 million, or 5.9 , in average loans, partially offset by a decline of 19.9 million, or 6.1 , in average investment securities driven by principal paydowns on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Average interest bearing liabilities increased by 7.6 million, or 1.3 , compared to the corresponding 2023 period, primarily due to increases in average time deposits, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings. The yield on earning assets increased 39 basis points, to 4.41 , due to a 47 basis point increase in the yield on average loans in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the cost to fund interest earning assets with interest bearing liabilities increased 51 basis points, to 2.38 . The net interest margin, on a fully tax equivalent basis, increased from 2.71 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.73 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Provision for Credit Losses: Juniata recorded a provision for credit losses of 232,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 121,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the 2024 period, this increase was due primarily to an updated loss driver analysis for the allowance for credit losses calculation and not a result of deteriorated asset quality, which remained strong. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and makes assessments as to specific loan impairment, charge-off expectations, general economic conditions in the Bank s market area, specific loan quality and other factors. See the earlier discussion in the Financial Condition section explaining the information used to determine the provision. Non-interest Income: Non-interest income was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.1 , compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Most significantly impacting non-interest income in the comparative three month periods were increases of 117,000 in customer service fees and 84,000 in the change in value of equity securities. Partially offsetting these increases in the comparative three month periods was a decrease of 35,000 in fees derived from loan activity primarily due to decreases in title insurance commissions and the derivative credit adjustment. As a percentage of average assets, annualized non-interest income was 0.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest Expense: Non-interest expense was 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.2 . Most significantly impacting non-interest expense in the comparative three month periods was an increase of 126,000 in employee benefits expense, due primarily to an increase in medical claims expenses, as well as an increase of 86,000 in both equipment expenses and professional fees. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest expense during the 2024 period was a 67,000 increase in taxes, other than income, due to recording a 62,000 Pennsylvania Shares Tax refund in the 2023 period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 47,000 in the provision for unfunded commitments recorded in other non-interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of average assets, annualized non-interest expense was 2.38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Income Taxes: An income tax provision of 270,000 was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax provision of 310,000 recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease between three month periods was mainly due to more taxable income recorded in the 2023 period. Juniata qualifies for a federal tax credit for an investment in a low-income housing partnerships. The tax credit was 82,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the tax credit lowered the effective tax rate from 18.5 to 14.2 compared to the same period in 2023, when the tax credit lowered the effective tax rate from 18.7 to 14.8 .

 Comparison of the Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operations Overview: Net income was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 184,000, or 3.7 , compared to net income 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per share, basic and diluted, was 0.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.1 , compared to 0.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Annualized return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.73 , compared to 0.79 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, annualized return on average equity was 14.70 in 2024 compared to 18.25 in 2023. Presented below are selected key ratios for the two periods: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Return on average assets (annualized) 0.73 0.79 Return on average equity (annualized) 14.70 18.25 Average equity to average assets 4.99 4.31 Non-interest income, as a percentage of average assets (annualized) 0.65 0.62 Non-interest expense, as a percentage of average assets (annualized) 2.38 2.39 The discussion that follows further explains changes in the components of net income when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income: Net interest income was 17.1 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Average earning assets increased 21.1 million, or 2.5 , to 856.2 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to an increase of 39.9 million, or 8.0 , in average loans. The increase in average loans was partially offset by a decline of 20.6 million, or 6.2 , in average investment securities as principal paydowns on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio were used to fund loan growth rather than being reinvested into the securities portfolio. Average interest bearing liabilities increased by 19.5 million, or 3.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable 2023 period, due to growth in average time deposits, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings, with this growth partially funding loan growth. The yield on earning assets increased 42 basis points, to 4.33 , due to a 51 basis point increase in the yield on average loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the cost to fund interest earning assets with interest bearing liabilities increased 68 basis points, to 2.31 . The net interest margin, on a fully tax equivalent basis, decreased from 2.77 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.70 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Provision for Loan Losses: Juniata recorded a provision for credit losses of 471,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 411,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due primarily to an updated loss driver analysis for the allowance for credit losses calculation in the third quarter of 2024 and not a result of deteriorated asset quality, which remained strong. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and makes assessments as to specific loan impairment, charge-off expectations, general economic conditions in the Bank s market area, specific loan quality and other factors. See the earlier discussion in the Financial Condition section explaining the information used to determine the provision. Non-interest Income: Non-interest income was 4.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8.4 . Most significantly impacting the comparative nine month periods were increases of 282,000 in customer service fees due to collecting more overdraft fees and deposit service charges, 144,000 in the change in value of equity securities due to an increase in bank stock market values and 114,000 in fees derived from loan activity due primarily to increases in title insurance commissions and guidance line and service fees. These increases were partially offset by a 161,000 decrease in life insurance proceeds as no proceeds were recorded in the 2024 period. As a percentage of average assets, annualized non-interest income was 0.65 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 0.62 in the comparable 2023 period. Non-interest Expense: Non-interest expense was 15.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.6 . Most significantly impacting non-interest expense in the comparative nine month periods were increases of 356,000 in salary expense due to annual salary increases and overtime pay from the core conversion in the first quarter of 2024, as well as increases of 124,000 in equipment expense, primarily due to an increase in office depreciation, and 196,000 in professional fees, primarily due to an increase in audit and consulting expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 180,000 in employee benefits expense, due to a decline in medical claims expense, and 227,000 in merger and acquisition expense due to the expense incurred in connection with the Path Valley branch acquisition in the 2023 period. As a percentage of average assets, annualized non-interest expense was 2.38 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.39 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for income taxes: An income tax provision of 767,000 was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax provision of 708,000 recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Juniata qualifies for a federal tax credit for investments in low-income housing partnerships. The tax credit decreased from 284,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 247,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the completion of the amortization period for one of Juniata s low-income housing partnership investments in January 2023.

 The tax credit lowered the effective tax rate from 18.4 to 13.9 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, when the tax credit lowered the effective tax rate from 17.6 to 12.6 . Liquidity: The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available, at a reasonable cost, to meet the ongoing operational cash needs of the Company and to take advantage of income producing opportunities as they arise. While the desired level of liquidity will vary depending upon a variety of factors, it is a primary goal of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity in all economic environments. Principal sources of asset liquidity are provided by loans and securities maturing in one year or less, and other short-term investments, such as federal funds sold and cash and due from banks. Liability liquidity, which is more difficult to measure, can be met by attracting deposits and maintaining the core deposit base. The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh for the purpose of providing short-term liquidity to supplement other sources of liability liquidity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overnight borrowings from the FHLB averaged 12.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 6.1 million in short-term borrowings and 5.0 million in long-term debt with the Federal Home Loan Bank, with a remaining unused borrowing capacity of 242.5 million with the FHLB. These credit facilities are secured by qualifying loans and investment securities held in safekeeping at the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 24.0 million in short-term borrowings with the Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP that matures in December 2024 with remaining unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve of 17.3 million. The Company opted to utilize this additional contingent liquidity source in order to take advantage of the program s advantageous borrowing rate. The Company has internal authorization for brokered deposits of up to 175.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no brokered deposits. In addition, the Company also has an unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank totaling 11.0 million, of which no funds were drawn at September 30, 2024. This line of credit is tested at least annually to ensure the availability of funds. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 15.6 million in funding derived from securities sold under agreements to repurchase (accounted for as collateralized financing transactions). This product is available through corporate cash management accounts for business customers and provides the Company with the ability to pay interest on corporate checking accounts. At September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits represented 20.5 of the Company s total deposits. This amount excludes deposits of state and political subdivisions because the Company pledges debt securities for deposits in excess of the 250,000 FDIC insurance limit in the case of those deposits. In view of the sources previously mentioned and the steps taken by the Company through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management believes the Company s liquidity can provide the funds needed to meet operational cash needs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk, credit risk and interest rate risk. These commitments consist mainly of loans approved but not yet funded, unused lines of credit and outstanding letters of credit. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Generally, financial and performance letters of credit have expiration dates within one year of issuance, while commercial letters of credit have longer term commitments. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same 

 52 

Table of Contents 
 as the risks that are involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds collateral and/or personal guarantees supporting these commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 140.4 million outstanding in loan commitments and other unused lines of credit extended to its customers as compared to 137.4 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 4.0 million and 3.6 million, respectively, of financial and performance letters of credit commitments outstanding. Commercial letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 12.9 million and 9.3 million, respectively. Management believes the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of collateral and the enforcement of guarantees would be sufficient to cover the potential amount of future payments required under the corresponding letters of credit. The current amount of the liability as of September 30, 2024 for payments under letters of credit issued was not material. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk. Additionally, the Company has sold qualifying residential mortgage loans to the FHLB as part of its Mortgage Partnership Finance Program Program ). Under the terms of the Program, there was limited recourse back to the Company for loans that do not perform in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Each loan sold under the Program is credit enhanced such that the individual loan s rating was raised to BBB , as determined by the FHLB. The Program can be terminated by either the FHLB or the Company, without cause. The FHLB has no obligation to commit to purchase any mortgage through, or from, the Company. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Interest rate sensitivity management is overseen by the Asset/Liability Management Committee. This process involves the development and implementation of strategies to maximize net interest margin, while minimizing the earnings risk associated with changing interest rates. Traditional gap analysis identifies the maturity and re-pricing terms of all assets and liabilities. A simulation analysis is used to assess earnings and capital at risk from movements in interest rates. Capital Adequacy: Bank regulatory authorities in the United States issue risk-based capital standards. These capital standards relate a banking company s capital to the risk profile of its assets and provide the basis by which all banking companies and banks are evaluated in terms of capital adequacy. The Basel III risk-based capital standards require financial institutions to maintain: (a) a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , (b) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 ; (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 ; and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0 , calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). In addition, the rules also limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the minimum risk-based standards stated in (a) (c). At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the regulatory requirements to be considered a "well capitalized" financial institution under Basel III, as well as exceeded the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 for the risk-based capital standards stated in (a) (c) in the paragraph above. The Company s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. At September 30, 2024, 45.6 million in undistributed earnings of the Bank, included in the consolidated 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 stockholders equity, was available for distribution to the Company as dividends without prior regulatory approval, subject to regulatory capital requirements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), Rule 13a-15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. These controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of a material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of capitalized expenditures. Specifically, controls were not designed and did not operate over the review of expenditures for capitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This material weakness resulted in restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and each of the interim periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of the financial statements or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential conditions, regardless of how remote. Attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this quarterly report are certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) and Rule 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act. This portion of the Company s quarterly report includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. Remediation of Material Weakness The Company s management has addressed the underlying cause of the material weakness referenced above by improving the design and operation of their controls over the accounting for capital expenditures and prepaid expenses. The enhanced internal controls have been in operation for a sufficient period of time and the Company s management has concluded that the material weakness has been fully remediated.
