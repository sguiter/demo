ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview of Our Business 

Planet Green Holdings Corp.
(the Planet Green ), headquartered in Flushing, NY, is not an operating company in the PRC but a Nevada holding company
with its operations conducted through its subsidiaries in the PRC, U.S., Hong Kong and Canada (the Subsidiaries and through
contractual arrangements with its variable interest entity, Jilin Chuanyuan (the VIE ), which is a company incorporated
in the PRC. Planet Green is engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including consumer products, chemical products, and online
advertising and mobile game. The VIE is consolidated for accounting purpose only and Planet Green does not own any equity interest in
the VIE. Investors may never directly hold equity interests in the VIE. The VIE structure is used to provide investors with exposure
to foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or limits direct foreign investment in the operating companies.
However, our contractual arrangements with the VIE are not equivalent of an investment in the VIE. Investors of our securities thus are
not purchasing equity interest in the VIE and their subsidiaries in China but instead are purchasing equity interest in a Nevada holding
company. Such VIE arrangement is not identical to owning such entities directly, and investors will own shares in a holding company with
contracts with the VIE and will not have any equity ownership of such VIE itself. The VIE arrangement may not be as effective as direct
ownership in providing us with control over the VIE. Direct ownership would allow us, for example, to directly or indirectly exercise
our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the boards of directors, which, in turn, could affect changes, subject to any applicable
fiduciary obligations at the management level. However, under the VIE arrangement, as a legal matter, if the VIE or its shareholders
fail to perform their respective obligations under the VIE arrangement, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant
resources to enforce those arrangements and resort to litigation or arbitration and rely on legal remedies under PRC laws. These remedies
may include seeking specific performance or injunctive relief and claiming damages, any of which may not be effective. In the event we
are unable to enforce these VIE Agreements or we experience significant delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing the VIE
arrangement, we may lose control over the assets owned by the VIE.

Our corporate structure is subject to risks relating
to our contractual arrangements with our VIE and its shareholders. Such contractual arrangements have not been tested in any of the PRC
courts. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations,
and rules relating to these contractual arrangements. If the PRC government finds these contractual arrangements non-compliant with the
restrictions on direct foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if the relevant PRC laws, regulations, and rules or the interpretation
thereof change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in the VIE or forfeit our
rights under the contractual arrangements. We and investors face uncertainty about potential future actions by the PRC government, which
could affect the enforceability of our contractual arrangements with our VIE and consequently, significantly affect the financial condition
and results of operations of us. If we are unable to claim our right to control the assets of the VIE, our common stock may decline in
value or become worthless. The PRC government could even disallow the VIE structure completely, which would likely result in a material
adverse change in our operations and our common stock may significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

5 

Under our corporate structure, our ability to pay
dividends and to service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses principally depends on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries
and VIE. Cash is transferred through our organization in the manner as follows: (1) we may transfer funds to our WFOEs through our Hong
Kong subsidiaries, Promising Prospect HK Limited, and Bless Chemical Co., Ltd. (HK) by additional capital contributions or shareholder
loans, as the case may be; (2) the VIE may pay service fees to our PRC subsidiaries for services rendered by our PRC subsidiaries; (3)
our PRC subsidiaries may pay service fees to the VIE for services rendered by the VIE; and (4) our PRC subsidiaries may make dividends
or other distributions to the Planet Green. We do not have cash management policies dictating how funds are transferred throughout our
organization. We may encounter difficulties in our ability to transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely
due to various PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange. If we intend to distribute dividends to the Planet Green, our WFOEs
will transfer the dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong
subsidiaries will transfer the dividends to the Planet Green, and the dividends can be distributed from the Planet Green to all shareholders
respectively in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries
or regions. However, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will not intervene or impose restrictions on the Company s
ability to transfer cash out of China. In 2023, our PRC subsidiaries did not receive any cash benefits from the VIE for services rendered
to the VIE and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, the VIE owns 2,823,782 to our WFOE. As of December 31, 2023, we were not subject
to any actual foreign exchange restrictions. The foregoing cash flows include all distributions and transfers between Planet Green, our
PRC subsidiaries and the VIE as of the date of this annual report. As of the date of this annual report, none of our subsidiaries have
ever issued any dividends or made other distributions to the Planet Green nor have Planet Green ever paid dividends or made other distributions
to U.S. investors. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to finance the VIE s and our subsidiaries operations
and to expand their business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any limitation on the
ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends to us or on the ability of the VIE to make payments to us may restrict our ability
to satisfy our liquidity requirements. To the extent cash or assets in the business is in the PRC or Hong Kong or in a PRC or Hong Kong
entity, and may need to be used to fund operations outside of the PRC or Hong Kong, the funds and assets may not be available to fund
operations or for other uses outside of the PRC or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations
by the government on our subsidiaries or the VIE s ability to transfer cash and assets. 

We face various legal and operational risks and
uncertainties related to being based in and having significant operations in mainland China. The PRC government has significant authority
to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on
U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, oversight on cybersecurity
and data privacy, as well as the lack of inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB on our
auditors. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the common stock or could significantly limit
or completely hinder our ability to offer common stock and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or be worthless. These regulatory risks and uncertainties could become applicable to our Hong Kong subsidiaries
if regulatory authorities in Hong Kong adopt similar rules and/or regulatory actions. 

6 

Because our operations are primarily located in
the PRC and Hong Kong through our subsidiaries and VIE, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations
in China and Hong Kong, including changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government, the relations between
China and the United States, or Chinese or United States regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and therefore,
these risks may result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock, or could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline
or be worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations
in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over
China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity
reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that our subsidiaries and VIE are directly subject
to these regulatory actions or statements, as we have not implemented any monopolistic behavior and our business does not involve the
collection of user data or implicate cybersecurity. As of the date of this annual report, no relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly
require us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC ), Cyberspace Administration of China
(the CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our offering, nor has our Nevada holding company or any of our subsidiaries
or our VIE received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding our offering from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities.
However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation
rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what
existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential
impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments
and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. The Standing Committee of the National People s Congress, or the SCNPC, or other
PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws, regulations or implementing rules that requires our company or any of our
subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before offering in the U.S. In other words, although the Company is
currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government to obtain such permission and has not received
any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly; our ability to offer, or
continue to offer, securities to investors would be potentially hindered and the value of our securities might significantly decline or
be worthless, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental
authorities, if we or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that
such permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain
such permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption by PRC governmental with little advance notice. 

As of the date of this annual report, the two
Hong Kong subsidiaries of Planet Green do not have any material operation in Hong Kong and they have not collected, stored, or managed
any personal information in Hong Kong. Therefore, we have concluded that currently it does not expect that laws and regulations in Mainland
China on data security, data protection, cybersecurity or anti-monopoly to be applied to its Hong Kong subsidiaries or that the oversight
of the Cyberspace Administration of China will be extended to its operations outside of Mainland China. 

In order to operate our business, in addition to
the required regular business licenses, Jingshan Sanhe is required to obtain Permit for Hazardous Chemical Products, Jilin Chuangyuan
is required to obtain Safe Production License, and Shandong Yunchu is required to obtain Permit for Food Products. As of the date of this
annual report, our subsidiaries, WFOEs and VIE have received from PRC authorities all requisite licenses, permissions, and approvals needed
to engage in the businesses currently conducted in the PRC, and no permission or approval has been denied. However, we cannot assure
you that any of these entities will be able to receive clearance of such compliance requirements in a timely manner, or at all in the
future. Any failure of these entities to fully comply with such compliance requirements may cause our PRC subsidiaries or the PRC operating
entities to be unable to begin their new businesses or operations in the PRC, subject them to fines, relevant new businesses or operations
suspension for rectification, or other sanctions. 

7 

As advised by our PRC counsel, Hubei Kaicheng Law
Offices, as of the date of this annual report, our subsidiaries, WFOEs and VIE, (i) are not required to obtain additional permissions
or approvals to operate their current business, (ii) are not required to obtain permission from the CSRC, the CAC, or any other Chinese
authorities to issue our securities to foreign investors based on PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, and (iii) have not
received or were denied such permission by any Chinese authorities. However, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory agencies, including
the CAC or the CSRC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that the VIE and its subsidiaries are always able to
successfully update or renew the licenses or permits required for the relevant business in a timely manner or that these licenses or permits
are sufficient to conduct all of their present or future business. If the VIE, WFOEs or any of its subsidiaries (i) does not receive
or maintain required permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently concludes that such permissions or approvals are not required,
or (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and the VIE or any of its subsidiaries is required to obtain such
permissions or approvals in the future, it could be subject to fines, legal sanctions, or an order to suspend their relevant services,
which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our securities to significantly
decline in value or become worthless. 

In light of the recent statements and regulatory
actions by the PRC government, such as those related to the use of variable interest entities, data security, and anti-monopoly concerns,
Planet Green may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard, and if Chinese regulatory
authorities disallow the VIE structure, that may result in a material change in our operations and/or value of our securities, including
that the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Planet Green may also be subject to penalties and sanctions
imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, if it fails to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely
affect the ability of Planet Green to continue to be listed for trading on NYSE American or another foreign exchange, which may cause
the value of Planet Green s securities to significantly decline or become worthless. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
(the HFCA Act and related regulations call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market
companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors and could add uncertainties to Planet Green s offering that trading
in Planet Green s securities may be prohibited under the HFCA Act. Planet Green s auditor, YCM CPA Inc., is headquartered
in California and has been inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB on a regular
basis. Our auditor is not included in the list of PCAOB Identified Firms of having been unable to be inspected or investigated completely
by the PCAOB in the PCAOB Determination Report issued in December 2021. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering
the prohibitions under the HFCA Act from three years to two. On December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023, which, among other things, amended the HFCAA to reduce the number of consecutive years an issuer can be identified as a Commission-Identified
Issuer before the Commission must impose an initial trading prohibition on the issuer s securities from three years to two years.
Therefore, once an issuer is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years, the Commission is required under
the HCFAA to prohibit the trading of the issuer s securities on a national securities exchange and in the over-the-counter market.
Although we believe that the HFCA Act and the related regulations do not currently affect us, we cannot assure you that there will not
be any further implementations and interpretations of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act or the related regulations, which
might pose regulatory risks to and impose restrictions on us because of our operations in mainland China. 

Planet Green is engaged in a number of diverse
businesses, including consumer products, chemical products, advertising and mobile game.

Consumer Products Business 

The Company s consumer products business
is conducted through two subsidiaries: Shandong Yunchu and Xianning Bozhuang. 

Shandong Yunchu imports and distributes animal
proteins, mainly beef products in Chinese market. It markets and transports the best beef products from the world s major agricultural
regions. Shandong Yunchu has the mature global purchasing network and has gained the trust and authority of many international brands
with more than 8 years of development and accumulation. Beef products are marketed domestically to food retailers, foodservice distributors,
restaurant operators, hotel chains and other food processors. Over the past few years, Yunchu develops into a professional integrated
company, which can manage import, storage, whole sale, retail and distribution. 

Xianning Bozhuang produces and distributes a variety
of Chinese tea leaves broadly categories including Cyan brick tea, black tea and green tea in China. 

Competition 

Shandong Yunchu mainly purchased frozen beef from
six countries: Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand and 25 factories are involved. The top ten suppliers include:
Marrig, Minerva S.A., G K O Connor Pty Ltd, Frigorifico matadero Pando ontilcor S.A., Las Moras, Frigorifico de Osorno S.A.,
Ersinal S.A. ecoparks S.A., lorsinal S.A., and Minerva S.A. The Company has established a stable long term cooperative relationship with
these beef and mutton manufacturers. The stable supply provides competitive advantage for Company to procure various various beef products
with high quality and low price to meet the needs of domestic customers. 

Our food products compete with those of other food
producers and processors and certain prepared food manufacturers. We seek to achieve a leading market position for our products via our
principal marketing and competitive strategy, which includes: 

identifying target markets for value-added products; 

concentrating production, sales and marketing efforts to appeal to and enhance demand from those markets; and 

utilizing our national distribution systems and customer support services. 

Past efforts indicate customer demand can be increased
and sustained through application of our marketing strategy, as supported by our distribution systems. The principal competitive elements
are price, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of products,
customer service and credit terms. 

Black tea is produced in Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan,
Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi and Anhui provinces in China. Our black tea products are processed in our factory in Hubei province and distributed
nationwide. There are few large players on the market but we face fierce competition from numerous small black tea manufactures and distributors.
However, as our brand has over hundreds of year s history, we have accumulated loyal consumers and gained favorable market reputation
over years.

Jingshan Sanhe has four production lines on an
11,000-square-meter facility and capacities to complete manufacturing, labeling, and packaging. Jingshan Sanhe researches, manufactures
and distributes ethanol fuel products in China. 

Competition 

The specialty chemical industry comprises a number
of companies similar in size to the Jilin Chuangyuan, as well as companies larger and smaller than Jilin Chuangyuan. The Company cannot
readily determine its precise competitive position in every industry it serves. However, the Company estimates it holds a leading regional
position in the market for production of formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde glue in Chinese northeast provinces. Competition in the industry
is based primarily on the ability to supply products that meet the needs of the customer and to a lesser extent, on price. Since its inception,
the company has developed rapidly relying on advanced enterprise management and safe, effective, exclusive patented products and strong
marketing strength. The production scale of formaldehyde is ranking top three among provinces in northeast China. The production scale
of urea-formaldehyde glue attains the first place in China. Our enterprise comprehensive strength is considered first tier among all companies
in northeast China. 

There are many other companies operating in the
renewable energy. Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect
on the competitive landscape. The clean energy markets are heavily fragmented. We believe we are in a strong position to compete for new
project development and supply opportunities. Competition for such opportunities, however, including the prices being offered for fuel
supply, affect the profitability of the opportunities we pursue, and may make opportunities unsuitable to pursue. Jingshan Sanhe is one
of the top ten private enterprises in the region of Jingshan with 12 patents, 17 sets of professional laboratory equipment and 2 advanced
and complete production lines. 

The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive.
The biggest competition for alcohol-based high clean fuel used as a vehicle fuel is gasoline and diesel because most vehicles in our key
markets are powered by these fuels. Many established businesses are in the market for alcohol-based high clean fuels and other alternatives
for use as vehicle fuel, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, industrial gas companies, truck
stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers, utilities and their affiliates and other organizations. 

If the alternative vehicle fuel market grows then
the number and type of participants in this market and their level of capital and commitments to alternative vehicle fuel programs will
increase. We compete for vehicle fuel users based on demand for the type of fuel, which may be affected by a variety of factors, including,
among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, cleanliness, and safety of the fuel; cost, availability and reputation of vehicles
and engines; convenience and accessibility of fueling stations; regulatory mandates and other requirements; and recognition of the brand.
We believe we compare favorably with our competitors based on these factors; however, some of our competitors have substantially greater
financial, marketing, and other resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes
in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends; devote greater resources to the development, promotion
and sale of their products; adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in
support of their business or product development activities; implement more robust or creative initiatives to advance consumer acceptance
of their products; or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market.

13 

Each of the VIE Agreements is described in detail
below: 

Consultation and Service Agreement . Pursuant
to the Consultation and Service Agreement, WFOE has the exclusive right to provide consultation and services to the operating entities
in China in the area of business management, human resource, technology and intellectual property rights. WFOE exclusively owns any intellectual
property rights arising from the performance of this Consultation and Service Agreement. The amount of service fees and payment term can
be amended by the WFOE and operating companies consultation and the implementation. The term of the Consultation and Service Agreement
is 20 years. WFOE may terminate this agreement at any time by giving 30 day s prior written notice. 

Business Cooperation Agreement . Pursuant
to the Business Cooperation Agreement, WFOE has the exclusive right to provide complete technical support, business support and related
consulting services, including but not limited to technical services, business consultations, equipment or property leasing, marketing
consultancy, system integration, product research and development, and system maintenance. WFOE exclusively owns any intellectual property
rights arising from the performance of this Business Cooperation Agreement. The rate of service fees may be adjusted based on the services
rendered by WFOE in that month and the operational needs of the operating entities. The Business Cooperation Agreement shall maintain
effective unless it was terminated or was compelled to terminate under applicable PRC laws and regulations. WFOE may terminate this Business
Cooperation Agreement at any time by giving 30 day s prior written notice. 

Equity Pledge Agreements . Pursuant to the
Equity Pledge Agreements among WFOE, operating entities and each of operating entities shareholder, shareholders of the operating
entities pledge all of their equity interests in the operating entities to WFOE to guarantee their performance of relevant obligations
and indebtedness under the Technical Consultation and Service Agreement and other control agreements. In addition, shareholders of the

meeting. The term of each Voting Rights Proxy Agreement is 20 years. WFOE has the right to extend each Voting Proxy Agreement by giving
written notification. 

As discussed above, we operate a portion of business
in China through the VIE and its subsidiaries, and rely on contractual arrangements among our WFOEs, the VIE, and their respective shareholders
to exert influence on the business operations of the VIE. The VIE structure provides our business operations in China with contractual
exposure to foreign investment. However, our contractual arrangements with the VIE are not equivalent of an investment in the VIE. Investors
are purchasing equity securities of our ultimate Nevada holding company rather than purchasing equity securities of the VIE. Chinese regulatory
authorities could disallow this structure, which would likely result in a material change in our and/or the VIE s operations and/or
a material change in the value of the securities we are registering for sale, including that it could cause the value of such securities
to significantly decline or become worthless. If the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements with the consolidated VIE
domiciled in China do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations
or the interpretation of existing regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we, our subsidiaries and the VIE could
be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish their interests in those operations. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws
or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. In addition, to
the extent cash is located in the PRC or within a PRC domiciled entity and may need to be used to fund operations outside of the PRC,
the funds may not be available due to limitations placed on us, our subsidiaries and the VIE by the PRC government. To the extent cash
or assets in the business is in the PRC or Hong Kong or in a PRC or Hong Kong entity, and may need to be used to fund operations outside
of the PRC or Hong Kong, the funds and assets may not be available to fund operations or for other uses outside of the PRC or Hong Kong
due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations by the government on us, our subsidiaries or the VIE s
ability to transfer cash and assets. 

14 

Cash Flows through Our Organization: 

Planet Green is a holding company with no material
operations of its own. We currently conduct our operations through our subsidiaries including our WFOEs, the VIE and their respective
subsidiaries. Cash is transferred through our organization in the manner as follows: (1) we may transfer funds to our WFOEs through our
Hong Kong subsidiaries, Promising Prospect HK Limited, and Bless Chemical Co., Ltd. (HK) by additional capital contributions or shareholder
loans, as the case may be; (2) the VIE may pay service fees to our PRC subsidiaries for services rendered by our PRC subsidiaries; (3)
our PRC subsidiaries may pay service fees to the VIE for services rendered by the VIE; and (4) our PRC subsidiaries may make dividends
or other distributions to Planet Green. We do not have cash management policies dictating how funds are transferred throughout our organization.
We may encounter difficulties in our ability to transfer cash between PRC subsidiaries and non-PRC subsidiaries largely due to various
PRC laws and regulations imposed on foreign exchange. If we intend to distribute dividends through Planet Green, our WFOEs will transfer
the dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiaries in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, and then our Hong Kong subsidiaries
will transfer the dividends to the Planet Green, and the dividends will be distributed from the Planet Green to all shareholders respectively
in proportion to the shares they hold, regardless of whether the shareholders are U.S. investors or investors in other countries or regions.
There can be no assurance the PRC government will not intervene or impose restrictions on the Company s ability to transfer cash
out of China. In 2023 our PRC subsidiaries did not receive any cash benefits from the VIEs for services rendered to the VIEs and their
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, our VIE owned 2,823,782 to our WOEFs as loan. As of December 31, 2023, we were not subject to
any actual foreign exchange restrictions. 

We have no present plans to distribute earnings
or settle amounts owed under the VIE agreements which it plans to retain the retained earnings to continue to grow the business. No dividends
or distribution has been declared to paid to Planet Green from subsidiaries or its VIEs and no dividends or distribution was made to any
U.S. investors. 

Effects of PRC foreign exchange regulations
on our ability to transfer assets within our organization 

Current foreign exchange and other regulations
in the PRC may restrict our PRC subsidiaries and VIE in their ability to transfer their net assets to Planet Green and its subsidiaries
and to investors. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases,
the remittance of currency out of China. Under our current corporate structure, Planet Green as the holding company may rely on dividend
payments from its subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements Planet Green may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange
regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign
exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE,
cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends to Planet Green. However, approval from
or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted
out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain
SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and VIE to pay off their respective debt in a currency
other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than
Renminbi. 

In light of the flood of capital outflows of China
in 2016 due to the weakening Renminbi, the PRC government has imposed more restrictive foreign exchange policies and stepped up scrutiny
of major outbound capital movement including overseas direct investment. More restrictions and substantial vetting process are put in
place by SAFE to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. If any of Planet Green s shareholders regulated
by such policies fail to satisfy the applicable overseas direct investment filing or approval requirement timely or at all, it may be
subject to penalties from the relevant PRC authorities. The PRC government may at its discretion further restrict access in the future
to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents Planet Green from obtaining sufficient
foreign currencies to satisfy Planet Green s foreign currency demands, Planet Green may not be able to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to its shareholders.

Recent Regulatory Development 

As we conduct substantially all of our operations
in China, we are subject to legal and operational risks associated with having substantially all of our operations in China, including
changes in the legal, political and economic policies of the Chinese government, the relations between China and the United States, or
Chinese or United States regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result
in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability
to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business
operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision
over China-based companies listed overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts
in anti-monopoly enforcement. We have relied on the opinion of our PRC counsel, Hubei Kaicheng Law Office, that as of the date of this
Annual Report, we are not directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements, as we have not implemented any monopolistic behavior
and our business does not involve large-scale collection of user data, implicate cybersecurity, or involve any other type of restricted
industry. As further advised by our PRC counsel, Hubei Kaicheng Law Office, as of the date of this Annual Report, no relevant laws or
regulations in the PRC explicitly require us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our overseas listing or securities offering plans, nor has our company or any of our subsidiaries
received any inquiry, notice, warning or sanctions regarding our offering of securities from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities.
However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published and official guidance and related implementation
rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain what potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily
business operations, or ability to accept foreign investments and list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. The Standing Committee of
the National People s Congress (the SCNPC or other PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate laws,
regulations or implementing rules that require our company or any of our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities
before offering securities in the U.S. In other words, although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of
the PRC central or local government and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected,
directly or indirectly; our ability to offer, or continue to offer, securities to investors would be potentially hindered and the value
of our securities might significantly decline or be worthless, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or
industry or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental authorities, if we or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such
permissions or approvals, (ii) inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations,
or interpretations change and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption
by PRC governmental with little advance notice. 

Enforcement of Civil Liabilities 

Currently all our directors and majority of senior
executive officers either are physically reside in China for a significant portion of each year, and/or are PRC nationals. As a result,
it may be difficult for you to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside mainland China. In addition, there is uncertainty
as to whether the PRC courts would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of U.S. securities laws or those of any U.S. state. 

The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments
are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the
requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made
or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other forms of written arrangement with the
U.S. that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures
Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates
the basic principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security, or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what
basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the U.S. 

It may also be difficult for you or overseas regulators
to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to
obtaining information needed for shareholder investigations or litigation outside China or otherwise with respect to foreign entities.
Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with its counterparts of another country or region
to monitor and oversee cross-border securities activities, such regulatory cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the
U.S. may not be efficient in the absence of a practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities
Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct
investigations or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. Article 177 further provides that Chinese entities and
individuals are not allowed to provide documents or materials related to securities business activities to foreign agencies without prior
consent from the securities regulatory authority of the PRC State Council and the competent departments of the PRC State Council. While
detailed interpretation of or implementing rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities
regulator to directly conduct an investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced
by you in protecting your interests.

Production Lines 

We currently manufacture our products using production lines. 

The production process for our cyan brick tea
products involves, primary processing of fresh leaves, piling and fermenting, storing and aging, picking, pressing, and baking. The production
process for our black tea products involves selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, withering, rolling, fermenting, baking and drying,
grading according to color, prompting fragrance, packing and warehousing. The production process for our green tea products involves
selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, airing, fixating, cooling, rolling, stir drying, selecting and grading, prompting fragrance,
packing and warehousing. 

The production process for our formaldehyde products
is illustrated as follows. The raw material methanol, after being injected into the high position tank, enters the methanol evaporator
through the filter, mixes with the air from the roots blower to form the binary mixture, and then adds steam to form the ternary mixture,
which is heated by the superheater to 120 and enters the oxidizer, carries out oxidation and dehydrogenation reaction through
the silver catalyst to form the formaldehyde gas, and then absorbs the formaldehyde solution through the first absorption tower and the
second absorption tower. The excess waste gas is burned out by the exhaust gas boiler. 

The production process for our methyl starting
with the raw materials methanol and formaldehyde are pumped into the reaction distillation tower according to the proportion. At the bottom
of the tower, formaldehyde and methanol are indirectly heated by steam. The reaction liquid vapor from the tower upwards through the catalyst
reaction to produce methyl acetal, and then through the distillation tower separation, cooling, the final product methyl acetal. 

The production process for our urea-formaldehyde
glue is demonstrated as follows. Formaldehyde is pumped from the formaldehyde workshop into the tank of formaldehyde storage, and then
pumped into the metering tank through the feed pump of formaldehyde. After the PH value is adjusted by adding alkali, it is sent into
the reaction kettle. At the same time, urea is also added into the kettle according to the corresponding proportion, heating the reaction
kettle. After heating up the kettle, melamine is added, so that the material can undergo addition reaction in the kettle. After the PH
value is adjusted by dropping formic acid in the kettle, the material is sent into the condensation kettle through the transfer pump.
Urea and additives are added into the condensation kettle according to a certain proportion for condensation reaction, and the finished
product is formed after cooling treatment. 

17 

The production process for our clean fuel
oil is illustrated as follows. The self-control design of the facilities for storage of raw materials and addition of additives shall,
in accordance with the requirements of the process, conduct centralized indication and adjustment of the temperature, flow rate and liquid
level of the raw oil tanks, raw oil metering tanks, product oil allocation tanks and finished oil tanks during the fuel blending process;
realize remote monitoring of the whole fuel production process, and conduct on-the-spot indication of pressure and partial flow rate. 

The production process for our construction rubber
powder (re-dispersible latex powder) is demonstrated as follows. Using polymer emulsion (VAE emulsion) as raw material, all kinds of additives
are added, and then transported to the reaction kettle through diaphragm pump to warm up and mix evenly, and then transported to the mixing
kettle with additives through diaphragm pump to mix evenly, then transported to the high-speed reactor through diaphragm pump to emulsify,
emulsified and then transported to the spare material tank through the diaphragm pump, and then transported to the spray drying tower
through the spare material tank through the diaphragm pump to form polymer powder after spray drying, and the polymer powder and various
additives are mixed and screened through the mixer to be packed into the warehouse.

all of the risks described on the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed by the Company on September 17, 2021, and as subsequently amended,
together with the other information contained in this report, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the events descripted

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 

We do not consider that we
face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted any cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity
risk. We depend on the digital technologies of third parties, and any sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in,
systems or infrastructure or the cloud that we utilize, including those of third parties, could lead to corruption or misappropriation
of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or reputation. Because of our reliance on the technologies of third parties, we also depend upon the personnel and the processes
of third parties to protect against cybersecurity threats, and we have no personnel or processes of our own for this purpose. As a company
without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We also lack
sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible
that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have material adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial
loss. 

Our board of directors is
generally responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, if there is any. Our management will promptly report to the
board of directors on incidents of material cybersecurity risks facing us and any third parties and the measures that may be taken to
mitigate such risks. As of the date of this annual report, we have not encountered any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected,
or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial
condition. We do, however, face risks from cybersecurity threats.

Net Revenues . Our net revenues for the
fiscal year ending on December 31, 2023 amounted to 27.12 million, reflecting a decline of approximately 17.64 million or 39 compared
to the previous year s figure of 44.76 million (ending on December 31, 2022). In the previous fiscal year, 50 of our total revenue was
generated from the sale of a diverse range of food products to restaurants. However, this segment has been significantly impacted by the
adverse effects of COVID-19, leading to a decline in sales from 23.34 million in 2022 to 14.32 million in 2023. The residual decrease
was attributable to disposal of certain subsidiaries in late 2022. 

Cost of Revenues. During the year ended
December 31, 2023, we experienced a decrease in cost of revenue of 14.72 million or 36 , in comparison to the year ended December 31,
2022, from approximately 40.41 million to 25.69 million. This change was mainly due to a decrease in sales of revenue, as discussed
above, and disposal of certain subsidiaries in late 2022. 

Gross Profit . Our gross profit
declined by 2.92 million, representing a decrease of 67 to 1.43 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to
 4.35 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. This decline can be primarily attributed to the aforementioned factors,
namely a decrease in sales revenue and the divestiture of certain subsidiaries towards the end of 2022. Additionally, another
contributing factor was a slight increase in the average combined cost per unit of our products. The gross profit margin decreased
from 10.77 in 2022 to 5.57 in 2023, representing a decrease of 5.2 . This decline is primarily attributed to the significant
reduction in sales of cold chain food mentioned earlier, as well as a notable increase in associated warehousing costs. 

Operating Expenses 

Selling and Marketing Expenses. Our selling
and marketing expenses decreased by 1.27 million, or 59 , to 0.90 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 2.17 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to the aforementioned reasons, attributable to a decrease in sales of revenue
and the disposal of certain subsidiaries in 2022. 

General and Administrative Expenses. Our
general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 1.98 million, or 28 , to 9.04 million compared
to the previous year s 7.06 million. After adjusting for the impact of 1.10 million from last year s General and Administrative
Expenses generated by the disposed subsidiary, the increase in fiscal 2023 is approximately 3.03 million. The primary reason for this
increase is attributed to inadequate inventory management, resulting in a loss of inventory of approximately 1.97 million and an expected
credit loss of 2.76 million on trade receivables, partially offset by a decrease of 1.70 million attributed to cost control during 2023. 

Net Loss 

Our net loss decreased by 5.09 million, or 20 ,
to a net loss of 20.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 25.94 million in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This decrease was mainly due to the aforementioned reasons, attributable to a decrease in sales of revenue and the disposal of certain
subsidiaries in 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze
our cash-on-hand and operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs meet our working capital requirements, operating
expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. In the reporting period in the fiscal year 2023, our primary sources of financing have
been cash generated from operations and private placements. 

26 

As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents
of 436.38 thousand compared to 93.49 thousand as of December 31, 2022. The debt to assets ratio was 54.40 and 33.16 as of December
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We expect to continue to finance our operations and working capital needs in 2023 from cash
generated from operations and, if needed, private financings. Suppose available liquidity is insufficient to meet our operating and loan
obligations as they come due. In that case, our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements or reducing expenditures as
necessary to meet our cash requirements. However, there is no assurance that we will raise additional capital or reduce discretionary
spending to provide liquidity if needed. We cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any alternative financing arrangements. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the Company has incurred a net loss of 20,843,796
attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of 140,724,597, a working capital deficit of 6,675,220, its net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023
was 5,282,343. 

These factors raise substantial doubt on the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management s plan for the Company s continued existence is dependent upon management s
ability to execute the business plan, develop the plan to generate profit; additionally, Management may need to continue to rely on private
placements or certain related parties to provide funding for investment, for working capital and general corporate purposes. If management
is unable to execute its plan, the Company may become insolvent. 

The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this report.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 3.73 million to
 5.28 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 from 9.01 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily
due to the decrease in net loss excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of 1.42 million and changes in net operating assets and
liabilities of 5.15 million. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities for
the year ended December 31, 2023 was 2.67 million, representing an increase of 6.52 million from the 3.85 million used in investing
activities for the same period in 2022. This increase is primarily attributed to the disposal of a certain subsidiary amounting to 2.77
million and a decrease in long-term investments totaling 4.10 million compared to the previous year. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December
31, 2023, amounted to 2.88 million, indicating a decrease of 7.95 million compared to the corresponding period in 2022. This decline
primarily stems from a reduction of 11.10 million in proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock as opposed to 2022, partially
offset by an increase of 2.97 million attributed to changes involving related parties during 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with the United States generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes to that, and related disclosures of commitments contingencies,
if any. 

We consider our critical accounting policies to
require the more significant judgments and estimates in preparing financial statements, including those outlined in Note 2 to the financial
statements included herein. 

The Company has evaluated the timing and the impact
of the guidance above on the financial statements. 

As of December 31, 2023, there were no other recently
issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance arrangements.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based upon the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal controls over financial
reporting were not effective. 

The significant deficiency identified by our management as of December
31, 2023, relates to the ability of the Company to record transactions and provide disclosures in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). We did not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate
level of experience in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. For example, our staff members
do not hold licenses such as Certified Public Accountant or Certified Management Accountant in the U.S., have not attended U.S. institutions
for training as accountants, and have not attended extended educational programs that would provide sufficient relevant education relating
to U.S. GAAP. Our staff will require substantial training to meet the demands of a U.S. public company and our staff s understanding
of the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting are inadequate. 

Remediation
Initiative 

We
plan to provide U.S. GAAP training sessions to our accounting team. The training sessions will be organized to help our corporate accounting
team gain experience in U.S. GAAP reporting and to enhance their awareness of new and emerging pronouncements with potential impact on
our financial reporting. We plan to continue to recruit experienced and professional accounting and financial personnel and participate
in educational seminars, tutorials, and conferences and employ more qualified accounting staff in the future.

than as described above, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, there were no material changes in our internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed during the fiscal year covered by this annual report that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

29 

Inherent
Limitations over Internal Controls. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes under U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: 

(i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements under U.S. GAAP, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only under authorizations of our management and directors; and 

(iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could
affect the financial statements. 

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls to prevent or detect all misstatements.
No matter how well designed and operated, a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of such controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of misstatements, if any, have been
detected or prevented. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk
that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and the shareholders
of 

Planet Green Holdings Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Planet Green Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of December 31, 2023 and
2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholder s equity, and
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company records an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023, and the Company currently has a working
capital deficit, continued net losses and negative cash flows from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. These consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter

matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Impairment
of goodwill - evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill 

Description
of the Matter 

As discussed in Note 2 and Note 14 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company s goodwill balance was 4.72 million as of December 31, 2023. the Company performs a goodwill
impairment test on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit
might exceed its fair value. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology
to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to
projected revenue growth rates, discount rates, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ).
Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit and the amount of any goodwill impairment
charge. In the year of 2023, the Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test in response to the decline in current market
conditions because of the persistent operating losses. The goodwill was determined to be not impaired. 

How We
Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

Addressing the matter involved evaluating the
Company s assessment of the value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method. These procedures included (i) We
performed a retrospective review comparing actual revenue and EBITDA results of the reporting unit for 2023 to the forecasted results
from 2024. (ii) We performed a retrospective review comparing management s estimates and assumptions relating to revenue, EBITDA,
and EBITDA margin projections for the reporting unit used for the purpose of current year s annual impairment test to the projections
previously used in connection with the prior year annual impairment test. (iii) We evaluated the consistency of estimates and assumptions
relating to revenue and EBITDA growth inherent in the discounted cash flow model for the reporting unit to those used by management in
other annual forecasting activities. (iv) With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodology
used and (2) the projections of long-term revenue growth and the discount rates by testing the underlying source information, and by developing
a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management. (v) We performed sensitivity analysis. 

Inventory
Valuation 

Description
of the Matter 	 

At December 31, 2023, the Company s net
inventory balance was 1.95 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory
carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory
quantities exceeding forecasted demand, and by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated demand. 

Auditing management s inventory excess and
obsolescence reserves involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry,
and competitive conditions outside the Company s control. In estimating excess and obsolescence reserves, management developed certain
assumptions, including forecasted demand which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product
life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. 

F- 3 

How We
Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

We obtained an understanding of internal controls
over the Company s inventory excess and obsolescence reserves estimation process, including the basis for developing the above-described
assumptions and management s judgments. 

Our audit procedures included, among others, with
the assistance of our fair value specialists, testing the reasonableness of management s key assumptions and judgments and testing
the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of excess and obsolescence reserves. We compared the
quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales. We also evaluated industry and market factors and performed
sensitivity analysis over the forecasted demand used by management to determine necessary changes in the inventory excess and obsolescence
reserves. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2022.

to
 . As the Company has a December 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory
federal rate of for the Company s fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accordingly, the Company has
remeasured the Company s deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards NOLs in the U.S at the lower enacted
cooperated tax rate of . However, this remeasurement has no effect on the Company s income tax expenses as the Company has provided
a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets previously. 

Additionally, the Act imposes a one-time transition
tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. The
change in rate has caused the Company to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and NOLs
and recorded one time income tax payable to be paid in 8 years. However, this one-time transition tax has no effect on the Company s
income tax expenses as the Company has no undistributed foreign earnings prior to December 31, 2023 which the Company has foreign cumulative
losses at December 31, 2023.

The Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740
related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes
a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions that the company has taken or expects
to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the net benefit recognized
and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A liability is recognized (or amount
of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s
potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions
of ASC 740.
