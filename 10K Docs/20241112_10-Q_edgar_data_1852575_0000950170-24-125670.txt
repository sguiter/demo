CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING F ORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q of Strategic Storage Trust VI, Inc., other than historical facts, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, seek, continue, or other similar words. 
 Any such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, and beliefs of, and assumptions made by, our management and involve uncertainties that could significantly affect our financial results. Such statements include, but are not limited to: (i) statements about our plans, strategies, initiatives, and prospects; and (ii) statements about our future results of operations, capital expenditures, and liquidity. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including, without limitation: 
 We have limited prior operating history and financing sources, and the prior performance of real estate investment programs sponsored by our Sponsor and its affiliates may not be an indication of our future results. 

We have incurred a net loss to date, have an accumulated deficit and our operations may not be profitable in 2024. 

There is currently no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one; therefore, it will be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares. Our charter does not require us to pursue a liquidity transaction at any time. 

Stockholders may be unable to sell their shares because their ability to have their shares redeemed pursuant to our share redemption program is subject to significant restrictions and limitations and if stockholders are able to sell their shares under the program, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares. 

The actual value of shares that we redeem under our share redemption program may be substantially less than what we pay. 

Until we generate operating cash flows sufficient to pay distributions, we may pay distributions from financing activities, which may include borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows or the net proceeds of our Public Offering (which may constitute a return of capital); in such event, we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties, and our stockholders overall return may be reduced. Therefore, it is likely that some or all of the distributions that we make will represent a return of capital, at least in the first few years of operation. We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter, bylaws or investment policies, and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions, and it is likely that we will use offering proceeds to fund a majority of our initial distributions. 

We may be unable to pay or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time. 

We may suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of an investment in us. 

Our ability to operate profitably will depend upon the ability of our Advisor to efficiently manage our day-to-day operations and the ability of our Property Manager and affiliates of our Advisor to effectively manage our properties. 

Our Advisor, Property Manager, and their officers and certain of our key personnel will face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operating results to suffer. 

Our Advisor will face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties, including conflicts with SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc. and Strategic Storage Growth Trust III, Inc., and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities. 

Our Advisor and its affiliates will face conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under our operating partnership agreement, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders. 

2 

SmartStop Storage Advisors, LLC SSA may receive economic benefits from its status as a special limited partner without bearing any of the investment risk. 

Our board of directors may change any of our investment objectives without the consent of our stockholders, including our focus on income-producing and growth self storage properties. 

Payment of fees to our Advisor and its affiliates will reduce cash available for investment and distribution. There are a number of such fees that may have to be paid and certain fees may be added or the amounts increased without stockholder approval. 

The growth portion of our property acquisition strategy involves a higher risk of loss than more conservative investment strategies. 

Because we are focused on the self storage industry, our rental revenues will be significantly influenced by demand for self storage space generally, and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. 

We will be subject to risks associated with joint venture partners in joint venture arrangements that otherwise may not be present in other real estate investments. 

We are subject to additional risks as a result of any joint venture interest or properties we acquire in Canada. 

Changes in the Canadian Dollar / USD exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the value of the investment of our stockholders. 

We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of an investment in us. 

We have incurred, and intend to continue to incur, indebtedness secured by our properties, which may result in foreclosure. 

Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions as we will incur additional tax liabilities. 

We have issued Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that ranks senior to all common stock and grants the holder superior rights compared to common stockholders, which may have the effect of diluting our stockholders interests in us and discouraging a takeover or other similar transaction. 

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this report is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
 
 For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business, and important factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, please refer to the factors listed and described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Risk Factors sections of the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (SEC Registration No. 333-256598), as amended, each as filed with the SEC, as supplemented by the risk factors included in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.

STRATEGIC STORAGE TRUST VI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 (Unaudited) 

 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in self storage facilities and commenced formal operations on March 10, 2021. Our year-end is December 31. As used herein, we, us, our and Company refer to Strategic Storage Trust VI, Inc. and each of our subsidiaries. SmartStop REIT Advisors, LLC is our sponsor (our Sponsor ). Our Sponsor is an indirect subsidiary of SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc. SmartStop ). Our Sponsor is a company focused on providing self storage advisory, asset management, and property management services. Our Sponsor owns of the economic interests (and of the voting membership interests) of Strategic Storage Advisor VI, LLC (our Advisor and owns of Strategic Storage Property Management VI, LLC (our Property Manager ). We have employees. Our Advisor, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on October 7, 2020. Our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf under the terms of an advisory agreement we entered into with our Advisor on February 26, 2021 (our Private Offering Advisory Agreement ), which was amended and restated on March 17, 2022 (our Advisory Agreement ). A majority of our officers are also officers of our Advisor, Sponsor and SmartStop. On January 15, 2021, our Advisor purchased approximately shares of our common stock for and became our initial stockholder. Our Articles of Incorporation authorized shares of common stock with a par value of per share. Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement (our Charter authorized shares of common stock with a par value of per share and shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share. On February 26, 2021, pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum (the private placement memorandum ), we commenced a private offering of up to in shares of our common stock and in shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the Private Offering ). On March 10, 2021, we commenced formal operations. In connection with the Public Offering, defined below, we filed articles of amendment to our Charter (the Articles of Amendment and articles supplementary to our Charter (the Articles Supplementary ). Following the filing of the Articles of Amendment and the Articles Supplementary, we authorized shares of common stock designated as Class P shares, shares of common stock designated as Class A shares, shares of common stock designated as Class T shares, and shares of common stock designated as Class W shares. Any common stock sold in the Private Offering were redesignated as Class P common stock upon the filing of the Articles of Amendment. On May 28, 2021, we filed a Form S-11 Registration Statement, which was subsequently amended, with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to register a maximum of in shares of Class A, Class T, and Class W common stock for sale to the public (the Primary Offering and in shares of Class A, Class T, and Class W common stock for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. On March 17, 2022, the SEC declared our registration statement effective and the primary portion of our Private Offering was terminated. On October 4, 2023, we filed a Post-Effective Amendment to our Registration Statement to register two new classes of common stock (Class Y shares and Class Z shares) with the SEC. On November 1, 2023, the Post-Effective Amendment to our Registration Statement became effective with the SEC. Also, on November 1, 2023, we filed articles supplementary to our Charter which reclassified Class T shares as Class Y shares and Class A shares as Class Z shares. Effective as of November 1, 2023, we are offering Class Y shares and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering for per share and are offering Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares and Class Z shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for per share (collectively, the Public Offering ). We are also continuing to offer Class P shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan in our Private Offering. On February 1, 2024, our board of directors approved an extension of our Public Offering to March 17, 2025, as permitted under applicable SEC rules. We may continue to sell Class Y shares and Class Z shares in our Public Offering until the third anniversary of the effective date of our Public Offering, March 17, 2025, unless further extended by our board of directors under applicable law. We also reserve the right to terminate our Public Offering at any time.

 sales commission for the sale of Class Y shares, (ii) the upfront dealer manager fee for the Class Y shares, and (iii) the estimated organization and offering expenses for the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares. In November 2023 our Sponsor agreed to reimburse the Company in cash to cover the dilution from the one-time stock dividend described below. In consideration for our Sponsor providing the funding for the front-end sales load and the cash to cover the dilution from the stock dividend, Strategic Storage Operating Partnership VI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (our Operating Partnership ), shall issue Series C Subordinated Convertible Units Series C Units to our Sponsor equal to the dollar amount of such funding divided by the then-current offering price (initially per share and currently per share) for the Class Y shares and Class Z shares sold in the Public Offering. The Series C Units shall initially have no distribution, voting or other rights to participate in our Operating Partnership unless and until such Series C Units are converted into Class A Units of our Operating Partnership. The Series C Units shall automatically convert into Class A Units on a one-to-one basis upon our disclosure of an estimated net asset value per share equal to at least per share for each of the Class A, Class P, Class T, Class W, Class Y, and Class Z shares calculated net of the value of Series C Units to be converted. Such conversion is limited such that the dilution caused by the conversion may not reduce the diluted estimated net asset value below per share. Series C Units were converted to Class A Units as a result of the Estimated Per Share NAV (as defined below) being declared. On November 1, 2023, the Company s board of directors declared to holders of record of Class A shares, Class T shares and Class W shares, respectively, as of November 15, 2023 (a) a one-time stock dividend of Class A shares per Class A share outstanding, (b) a one-time stock dividend of Class T shares per Class T share outstanding, and (c) a one-time stock dividend of Class W shares per Class W share outstanding. These stock dividends were issued to provide such stockholders who purchased Class A shares, Class T shares, or Class W shares in the Public Offering the same number of shares of the applicable class as they would have received if they purchased their shares at a price of per share, the offering price of Class Y shares and Class Z shares in the Public Offering. All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the one-time stock dividend. Prior to the termination of our Private Offering, approximately million shares of Class P common stock were sold for gross offering proceeds of approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million Class A shares, approximately million Class T shares, approximately million Class W shares, approximately million Class Y shares and approximately million Class Z shares had been sold in the Public Offering for gross offering proceeds of approximately million, approximately million, approximately million, approximately million and approximately million, respectively. Through our distribution reinvestment plan, we have issued approximately million Class P shares, approximately million Class A shares, approximately million Class T shares, approximately Class W shares, approximately Class Y shares and approximately Class Z shares for gross proceeds of approximately million. On August 7, 2024, our board of directors, upon recommendation of our nominating and corporate governance committee, approved an estimated value per share ("Estimated Per Share NAV") of for our Class A shares, Class P shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding on an adjusted fully diluted basis, calculated as of March 31, 2024. Series C Units were converted to Class A Units as a result of this Estimated Per Share NAV being declared. We have invested the net proceeds from our Private Offering and Public Offering primarily in self storage facilities consisting of both income-producing and growth properties located in the United States and Canada. As of September 30, 2024, we owned operating self storage properties located in seven states (Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington) and three Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario) and two development properties in Florida and Ontario. For more information, see Note 3 - Real Estate Facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we owned equity interests in unconsolidated real estate ventures in two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec) that are intended to be developed into self storage facilities, with subsidiaries of SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust SmartCentres owning the other of such entities. For more information, see Note 4 - Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures.

On February 26, 2021, in connection with entering into the Private Offering Advisory Agreement, SSA made an additional investment in our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests and a special limited partnership interest. On March 10, 2021, SmartStop OP, L.P.

At the effective time of the OP Investment, SmartStop OP was admitted as a limited partner to our Operating Partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we owned approximately of the common units of limited partnership interest of our Operating Partnership. The remaining approximately of the common units are owned by SmartStop OP. On January 30, 2023, we, our Operating Partnership, and an affiliate of our Sponsor (the Preferred Investor entered into a Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement pursuant to which our Operating Partnership issued and sold to the Preferred Investor, and the Preferred Investor purchased Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of Limited Partnership Interest (the Preferred Units at a liquidation preference of per unit (the Liquidation Amount in consideration for the Preferred Investor making a capital contribution to our Operating Partnership in an amount of million (the Preferred Investment ). On May 2, 2023, we redeemed the full amount of Series A Preferred Units for an amount equal to million plus the accrued and unpaid distributions. See Note 7 Preferred Equity. On May 1, 2023 (the Commitment Date ), we entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement (the Series B Purchase Agreement with Extra Space Storage LP (the Investor ), a subsidiary of Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR), pursuant to which the Investor committed to purchase million in preferred shares (the aggregate shares to be purchased, the Preferred Shares of our new Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ). The closing (the Closing in the amount of million occurred on the Commitment Date and we incurred approximately million in issuance costs related to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note 7 - Preferred Equity. Our Operating Partnership will own, directly or indirectly through one or more special purpose entities, all of the self storage properties that we acquire. We will conduct certain activities through our taxable REIT subsidiary, Strategic Storage TRS VI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the TRS which was formed on October 16, 2020 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership. Our Property Manager, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on October 7, 2020 to manage our properties. Our Property Manager will derive substantially all of its income from the property management services it performs for us. Our Property Manager may enter into sub-property management agreements with third party management companies and pay part of its management fee to such sub-property manager. See Note 8 Related Party Transactions Property Management Agreement. Our dealer manager is Pacific Oak Capital Markets, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our Dealer Manager ). On February 26, 2021, we entered into a dealer manager agreement with our Dealer Manager (the Private Offering Dealer Manager Agreement ), pursuant to which our Dealer Manager was responsible for marketing our shares being offered pursuant to the Private Offering.

As we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock, we transfer all of the net offering proceeds to our Operating Partnership as capital contributions in exchange for additional units of interest in our Operating Partnership. However, we will be deemed to have made capital contributions in the amount of gross proceeds received from investors, and our Operating Partnership will be deemed to have simultaneously paid the sales commissions and other costs associated with the offerings.

and million in intangible assets to recognize the value of in-place leases related to our acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We do not expect, nor to date have we recorded, intangible assets for the value of customer relationships because we expect we will not have concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover will be fairly frequent. Allocation of purchase price to acquisitions of facilities are allocated to the individual facilities based upon an income approach or a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual facility along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business, as defined under current GAAP, are accounted for as asset acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there were property acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets) or because the acquisition did not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. As a result, once an acquisition is deemed probable, transaction costs are capitalized rather than expensed. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business, and we capitalized approximately million and million, respectively, of acquisition-related transaction costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expensed approximately million and million, respectively, of acquisition-related transaction costs that did not meet our capitalization policy. During the nine

 sales commission for the sale of Class Y shares, (ii) the upfront dealer manager fee for the Class Y shares, and (iii) the estimated organization and offering expenses for the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares. In addition, the Sponsor reimbursed the Company in cash to cover the dilution from the one-time stock dividend described below. The Sponsor Funding Agreement will terminate immediately upon the date that the Company ceases to offer Class Y shares and Class Z shares in the Public Offering. In consideration for the Sponsor providing the funding for the front-end sales load described above and the cash to cover the dilution from the stock dividend, the Operating Partnership will issue a number of Series C Units to the Sponsor equal to the dollar amount of such funding divided by the then-current offering price (initially per share and currently per share) for the Class Y shares and Class Z shares sold in the Public Offering. Pursuant to the Sponsor Funding Agreement, the Sponsor shall reimburse the Company monthly within 30 days after the end of each calendar month for the applicable front-end sales load it agreed to fund, and the Operating Partnership shall issue the Series C Units on a monthly basis, effective as of the respective funding date. The Series C Units convert into Class A Units of our Operating Partnership if the estimated net asset value equal to at least per share. Such conversion is limited such that the dilution caused by the conversion may not reduce the diluted estimated net asset value below per share. On August 7, 2024, we declared an Estimated Per Share NAV of calculated as of March 31, 2024. Series C Units were converted to Class A Units as a result of this Estimated Per Share NAV being declared. The amount by which the funding received exceeds the fair value of the Series C Units is accounted for as a consideration received from a vendor and is therefore recorded as a reduction to the price of the services provided.

 of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of Class W shares towards payment of organization and offering expenses, which we recognized as a capital contribution from our Advisor. Our Advisor must reimburse us within after the end of the month in which the initial public offering terminates to the extent we paid or reimbursed organization and offering costs (excluding sales commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees and dealer manager servicing fees) in excess of of the gross offering proceeds from the Primary Offering. If at any point in time we determine that the total organization and offering costs are expected to exceed of the gross proceeds anticipated to be received from the Primary Offering, we will recognize such excess as a capital contribution from our Advisor. Offering costs are recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital, and organization costs are recorded as an expense. In connection with our Private Offering, our Dealer Manager received a sales commission of up to of gross proceeds from sales in the Private Offering and a dealer manager fee equal to up to of gross proceeds from sales in the Private Offering under the terms of the Private Offering Dealer Manager Agreement. In connection with our Primary Offering, our Dealer Manager will receive a sales commission of up to of gross proceeds from sales of Class A shares and up to of gross proceeds from the sales of Class T shares and Class Y shares in the Primary Offering and a dealer manager fee up to of gross proceeds from sales of Class A shares, Class T shares and Class Y shares in the Primary Offering under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement. Our Dealer Manager does not receive an upfront sales commission or dealer manager fee from the sales of Class W shares or Class Z shares in the Primary Offering; however, we and/or our Sponsor will pay to our Dealer Manager dealer manager support in the amount of of the gross offering proceeds of the Class W shares and Class Z shares sold in the Primary Offering for payment of wholesaler commissions and other wholesaler expenses associated with the sales of the Class W shares and Class Z shares. In addition, our Dealer Manager receives an ongoing stockholder servicing fee that is payable monthly and of the Class T shares and Class Y shares sold in the Primary Offering. Our Dealer Manager also receives an ongoing dealer manager servicing fee that is payable monthly and of the Class W shares and Class Z shares sold in the Primary Offering. We will cease paying the stockholder servicing fee with respect to the Class T shares and Class Y shares sold in the Primary Offering at the earlier of (i) the date we list our shares on a national securities exchange, merge or consolidate with or into another entity, or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) the date at which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class A shares, Class T shares, Class Y shares, Class W shares and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), which calculation shall be made by us with the assistance of our Dealer Manager commencing after the termination of our Primary Offering; (iii) with respect to a particular Class T share and Class Y share, the third anniversary of the issuance of such share; and (iv) the date that such Class T share or Class Y share is redeemed or is no longer outstanding. We will cease paying the dealer manager servicing fee with respect to the Class W share and Class Z share sold in the Primary Offering at the earlier of (i) the date we list our shares on a national securities exchange, merge or consolidate with or into another entity, or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) the date at which the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources equals of the gross proceeds from the sale of

 of the gross proceeds from the sale of Class W shares and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), which calculation shall be made by us with the assistance of our Dealer Manager commencing after the termination of our Primary Offering, and (iv) the date that such Class W share or Class Z share is redeemed or is no longer outstanding. Our Dealer Manager enters into participating dealer agreements with certain other broker-dealers which authorize them to sell our shares. Upon sale of our shares by such broker-dealers, our Dealer Manager will re-allow all of the sales commissions and, subject to certain limitations, the stockholder servicing fees paid in connection with sales made by these broker-dealers. Our Dealer Manager may also re-allow to these broker-dealers a portion of their dealer manager fee as marketing fees, reimbursement of certain costs and expenses of attending training and education meetings sponsored by our Dealer Manager, payment of attendance fees required for employees of our Dealer Manager or other affiliates to attend retail seminars and public seminars sponsored by these broker-dealers, or to defray other distribution-related expenses. Our Dealer Manager will also receive reimbursement of bona fide due diligence expenses; however, to the extent these due diligence expenses cannot be justified, any excess over actual due diligence expenses would have been considered underwriting compensation subject to a FINRA limitation and, when aggregated with all other non-accountable expenses in connection with our Public Offering, may not exceed of gross offering proceeds from sales in the Public Offering.

 fixed rate notes payable at September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions, including discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate notes payable was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. These assumptions are considered level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. As of September 30, 2024 we had fixed rate notes payable outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we believe the fair value of our variable rate debt are reasonably estimated at their notional amounts as there have been minimal changes to the fixed spread portion of interest rates for similar loans observed in the market, and as the variable portion of our interest rates fluctuate with the associated market indices.

To comply with GAAP, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
 Although we had determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our hedges were within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our hedges utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, through September 30, 2024, we had assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our hedge positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustment was not significant to the overall valuation of our hedge. As a result, we determined that our hedge valuation in its entirety was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 of the REIT s ordinary taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We filed an election to treat our TRS as a taxable REIT subsidiary. In general, the TRS performs additional services for our customers and generally engages in any real estate or non-real estate related business. The TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax. The TRS follows accounting guidance which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of future differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

In the event total organization and offering expenses actually incurred exceed the estimated organization and offering expenses for the sale of Class Y shares and Class Z shares, we will pay the difference between the total organization and offering expenses actually incurred and the estimated organization and offering expenses funded by our Sponsor. In addition, our Sponsor has agreed to reimburse us in cash to cover the dilution from the one-time stock dividends described above in Note 1 - Organization. The sponsor funding agreement shall terminate immediately upon the date we cease to offer Class Y shares and Class Z shares in our Public Offering.

For the avoidance of doubt, some or all of the Series C Subordinated Convertible Units issued pursuant to the Initial NAV Hurdle may convert at the time of disclosing that the Initial NAV Hurdle has been met. In the event of an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) prior to such conversion, the Series C Subordinated Convertible Units shall automatically convert into Class A Units on a one-to-one basis immediately prior to the closing of the extraordinary transaction if the transaction amount exceeds the Initial NAV Hurdle for each of the Class A, Class T, Class W, Class P, Class Y, and Class Z shares for those Series C Subordinated Convertible Units issued at or below the Initial NAV Hurdle calculated net of the value of the Series C Units to be converted; provided, the transaction amount exceeds the New NAV Hurdle for each of the Class A, Class T, Class W, Class P, Class Y, and Class Z shares for those Series C Subordinated Convertible Units issued at an offering price in excess of per share in the event that the NAV and resulting offering price is increased in the future as a result of calculating and reporting the NAV.

Rights upon Liquidation: Notwithstanding the provisions of the Operating Partnership Agreement governing distributions upon liquidation, if, after the conversion of any Series C Subordinated Convertible Units into a Class A Unit, the liquidating gain from a sale, exchange, merger, liquidation or other transaction is insufficient to cause the holder of the converted Series C Subordinated Convertible Units to receive an amount of cash or property (at minimum) equal to the liquidation right for the holders of Class A Units on a unit by unit basis, each such unit holder shall nevertheless receive an amount equal to the liquidation right for the holders of Class A Units on a unit by unit basis, for each converted Series C Subordinated Convertible Unit (the Series C Unit Liquidation Preference ). Upon the actual liquidation of our Operating Partnership, the cash payment of the Series C Unit Liquidation Preference shall be treated as (1) a liquidation distribution from our Operating Partnership to the extent of the section 704(b) capital account attributable to the converted Series C Subordinated Convertible Units and (2) a guaranteed payment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the excess of the Series C Unit Liquidation Preference in cash over the section 704(b) capital account balance of the holder of the Series C Subordinated Convertible Unit for each such converted Series C Subordinated Convertible Unit. For avoidance of doubt, the Series C Subordinated Convertible Units are subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in Amendment No. 3 prior to conversion and are not entitled to any liquidation right until conversion.

 Overview 
 Strategic Storage Trust VI, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the Company ), was formed on October 14, 2020 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in self storage facilities and commenced formal operations on March 10, 2021. We made an election to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. 
 On February 26, 2021, pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum, we commenced a private offering (the Private Offering of up to 200,000,000 in shares of our common stock and 20,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. Please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information. The primary portion of the Private Offering was terminated on March 17, 2022. We received approximately 100.7 million in offering proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the Private Offering.

 In connection with the Public Offering, defined below, we filed articles of amendment to our Charter (the Articles of Amendment and articles supplementary to our Charter (the Articles Supplementary ).

On November 1, 2023, the Post-Effective Amendment to our Registration Statement became effective with the SEC. Also, on November 1, 2023, we filed articles supplementary to our Charter which reclassified 200,000,000 Class T shares as Class Y shares and 70,000,000 Class A shares as Class Z shares. Effective as of November 1, 2023, we are offering Class Y shares and Class Z shares in our Primary Offering for 9.30 per share and are offering Class A shares, Class P shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares and Class Z shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan for 9.30 per share (collectively, the Public Offering ).

 As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024, on August 7, 2024, our board of directors, upon recommendation of our nominating and corporate governance committee, approved an Estimated Per Share NAV of 10.00 for our Class A shares, Class P shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the 
 49 

number of shares outstanding on an adjusted fully diluted basis, calculated as of March 31, 2024. No Series C Units were converted to Class A Units as a result of this Estimated Per Share NAV being declared. See our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024 for more details related to the determination of our Estimated Per Share NAV.

Development properties 
 Bradenton Land 
 On February 16, 2023, we, through an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, acquired a parcel of land adjacent to our property in Bradenton, Florida (the Bradenton Land from an unaffiliated third party. The purchase price for the Bradenton Land was approximately 1.4 million, plus closing costs and an acquisition fee to our advisor, which was funded by proceeds from our Primary Offering. We intend to expand our current self storage property on the Bradenton Land. Estimated development cost is approximately 5 million, which we expect to fund with a combination of net proceeds from our Primary Offering and/or potential future debt financing. 
 Etobicoke Land 
 On March 27, 2023, we, through an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, acquired a parcel of land to be developed into a self storage facility located in Etobicoke, in the city of Toronto, Ontario (the Etobicoke 
 50 

Land from an unaffiliated third party. The purchase price for the Etobicoke Land was approximately CAD 2.2 million, plus closing costs and an acquisition fee to our advisor. We funded such acquisition with net proceeds from our Primary Offering. Our cost to complete development is approximately CAD 12.0 million, which we expect to fund with a combination of net proceeds from our Primary Offering and/or potential future debt financing. 
 Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 We have entered into joint venture agreements with a subsidiary of SmartCentres, an unaffiliated third party, to acquire tracts of land and develop them into self storage facilities. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and they will be stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings (loss) will generally be recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated investments.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have established accounting policies which conform to generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the U.S. Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Following is a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in setting accounting policies that we consider critical in the presentation of our financial statements. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of GAAP may have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance, or on the comparability of such information to amounts reported for other periods, because of the subjectivity and judgment required to account for highly uncertain items or the susceptibility of such items to change. These estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and our reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses would have been recorded, thus resulting in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may use different estimates and assumptions that may impact the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations to those companies. 
 We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following: real estate purchase price allocations; the evaluation of whether any of our long-lived assets have been impaired; the determination of the useful lives of our long-lived assets; and the evaluation of the consolidation of our interests in joint ventures. The following discussion of these policies supplements, but does not supplant the description of our significant accounting policies, as contained in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report, and is intended to present our analysis of the uncertainties involved in arriving upon and applying each policy. 
 51 

Real Estate Acquisition Valuation 
 We account for acquisitions in accordance with GAAP which requires that we allocate the purchase price of a property to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. This guidance requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, which requires the use of significant unobservable inputs as of the acquisition date. 
 The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Because we believe that substantially all of the leases in place at properties we will acquire will be at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts, we do not expect to allocate any portion of the purchase prices to above or below market leases. We also consider whether in-place, market leases represent an intangible asset. Acquisitions of portfolios of facilities are allocated to the individual facilities based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual facility along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. 
 Our allocations of purchase prices are based on certain significant estimates and assumptions, variations in such estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The majority of our assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, consist of long-lived real estate assets as well as intangible assets related to our acquisitions. We evaluate such assets for impairment based on events and changes in circumstances that may arise in the future and that may impact the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including those held through joint ventures. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we will assess the recoverability of the particular asset by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered, through an evaluation of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. This evaluation is based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Based on this evaluation, if the expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we will adjust the value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss. Our evaluation of the impairment of long-lived assets could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the amount of impairment loss recognized, if any, may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets 
 We assess the useful lives of the assets underlying our properties based upon a subjective determination of the period of future benefit for each asset. We record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon the estimated useful lives we determine. Our determinations of the useful lives of the assets could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as such determinations, and the corresponding amount of depreciation expense, may vary dramatically based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 Consolidation Considerations 
 We evaluate the consolidation of our investments in joint ventures in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. This evaluation requires us to determine whether we have a controlling interest in a joint venture through a means other than voting rights, and, if so, such joint venture may be required to be consolidated in our financial statements. Our evaluation of our joint ventures under such accounting guidance could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the joint venture entities included in our financial statements may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We made an election under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2021. By qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we believe that we 
 52 

are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 Current Market and Economic Conditions 
 Our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the demand for self storage space. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late March 2020, the broader shift of people working from home, elevated migration patterns and strength in the housing market helped drive growth in self storage demand, which generally contributed to our results since the onset of COVID-19, and through calendar year 2022. In addition to the sector s numerous historical demand drivers, one demand driver that developed and has continued as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the trend towards working from home, or a hybrid work environment. 
 While the work from home environment remains elevated over pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, this trend began to wane in 2023, which we believe has led to elevated move-outs. As a result, occupancy, same-store growth and overall results have been normalizing and are expected to normalize further over the coming quarters as the comparable periods change. 
 Further, the broader economy has been experiencing elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, tightening monetary and fiscal policies and a slowdown in home sales and population mobility. This could result in less discretionary spending, weakening consumer balance sheets and reduced demand for self storage. Additionally, a prolonged period of elevated inflation and/or higher interest rates could result in a further contraction of self storage demand. However, demand for the self storage sector is dynamic with drivers that function in a multitude of economic environments, both cyclically and counter-cyclically. Demand for self storage tends to be needs-based, with numerous factors that lead customers to renting and maintaining storage units. Additionally, the broader interest rate and inflationary environment has moderated since the beginning of 2024. These factors could lead to increased levels of population mobility, specifically amongst single family home buyers and sellers, which could increase demand for self storage. Certain property operating expenses have experienced elevated pressures to date, namely property insurance, property taxes and payroll have seen above average increases, primarily due to inflation and natural disasters. As a result, we have experienced a year-over-year decrease in gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024. 
 In 2022, the Federal Reserve began increasing its targeted range for the federal funds rate, leading to increased interest rates. This approach to monetary policy was mirrored by other central banks across the world, to similar effect. We currently have fixed or capped interest rates of varying durations for the majority of our loans, either directly or indirectly through our use of interest rate hedges. The rise in overall interest rates has caused an increase in our variable rate borrowing costs and our overall cost of capital, resulting in an increase in net interest expense. Capitalization rates on acquisitions have not increased at the same magnitude as interest rates. These factors may limit our ability to make accretive acquisitions of self storage properties, negatively impact our profitability, and affect our ability to comply with certain financial covenants. However, with anticipation of the Federal Reserve lowering its target range for the federal funds rate, interest rates across the curve began to decrease in the first half of 2024. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its targeted range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. In November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its targeted range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 We derive revenues principally from: (i) rents received from tenants who rent storage units under month-to-month leases at each of our self storage facilities; and (ii) sales of packing- and storage-related supplies at our storage facilities. Therefore, our operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing tenants and lease our available self storage units to new tenants, while maintaining and, where possible, increasing the prices for our self storage units. Additionally, our operating results depend on our tenants making their required rental payments to us. 
 Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental revenues and operating expenses of our facilities. Development of any new self storage facilities would intensify competition of self storage operators in markets in which we operate. 
 On March 10, 2021, we commenced formal operations and we acquired our first six self storage properties during 2021. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned 24 operating self storage facilities. 
 Our operating results for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, include full period results for 24 properties. During the second quarter of 2023, we acquired seven self storage properties that were primarily in the 
 53 

lease-up phase. As such, we believe there is little basis for comparison between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating results in future periods will depend on the results of operations of these properties and the real estate properties that we acquire in the future. 
 Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include full period results for 24 self storage facilities. Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include full period results for 15 self storage facilities, and partial period results for nine properties acquired during the first nine months of 2023. As such, we believe there is little basis for comparison between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating results in future periods will depend on the results of operations of these properties and the real estate properties that we acquire in the future. 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total Revenues 
 Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 7.3 million and approximately 6.3 million, respectively. The increase in total revenue of approximately 1.0 million is primarily attributable to the lease up of our non-stabilized properties. We expect total revenues to increase in the future commensurate with our future acquisition activity and lease-up of our non-stabilized properties. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 2.8 million and approximately 2.6 million, respectively. Property operating expenses include the costs to operate our facilities including payroll, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and marketing. The increase in property operating expenses of approximately 0.2 million is primarily attributable increased property insurance and property taxes. We expect property operating expenses to increase in the future as our operational activity increases but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we lease-up our non-stabilized properties. 
 Property Operating Expenses Affiliates 
 Property operating expenses affiliates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.3 million and approximately 1.4 million, respectively.

We expect property operating expenses affiliates to increase in the future as our operational activity increases. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.5 million. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal expenses, directors and officers insurance, transfer agent fees, an allocation of a portion of our Advisor s payroll related costs, accounting expenses and board of directors related costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as our operational activity increases, but decrease as a percentage of total revenue. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 3.9 million and approximately 4.6 million, respectively. Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation on the buildings and site improvements at our properties. Amortization expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 0.7 million is primarily related to intangible assets from the 2022 and 2023 acquisitions being fully amortized during the first half of 2024. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in future periods commensurate with our future acquisition activity. 
 Acquisition Expenses Affiliates 
 Acquisition expenses affiliates for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.1 million. Acquisition expenses primarily relate to the costs associated with our potential acquisitions prior to the 
 54 

acquisitions becoming probable in accordance with our capitalization policy. We expect acquisition expenses- affiliates to fluctuate in the future commensurate with our acquisition activity. 
 Other Property Acquisition Expenses 
 Other property acquisition expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.1 million and approximately 0.2 million, respectively.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 4.5 million and approximately 4.7 million, respectively. The decrease of approximately 0.2 million is primarily attributable to a decrease in rates on our variable rate debt. We expect interest expense to fluctuate in the future commensurate with our future debt level and interest rates. 
 Interest Expense Debt Issuance Costs 
 Interest expense debt issuance costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.3 million and approximately 0.4 million, respectively. Interest expense debt issuance costs reflects the amortization of fees incurred in connection with obtaining financing. We expect interest expense debt issuance costs to increase commensurate with our future financing activity. 
 Derivative Fair Value Adjustment 
 Derivative fair value adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1.8 million loss and 1.0 million gain, respectively. Derivative fair value adjustment consists of fair market value adjustment of our interest rate derivatives we elected not to apply hedge accounting. We expect the derivative fair value adjustment to change in the future based upon changes in interest rates. 
 Other Income 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.1 million and approximately 0.2 million, respectively. Other income consists primarily of interest income received on cash and restricted cash. We expect other income to change in the future based upon changes in interest rates and cash on hand. 
 Foreign Currency Adjustment 
 Foreign currency adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.8 million gain and approximately 2.4 million loss, respectively. Foreign currency adjustment consists of changes in foreign currency related to our net investments in real estate facilities and unconsolidated real estate ventures in Canada, not classified as long term in accordance with GAAP. We expect foreign currency adjustment to change in the future based upon changes in exchange rates, as well as future net investments in real estate in currencies other than United States dollars. 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total Revenues 
 Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 20.9 million and approximately 14.7 million, respectively. The increase in total revenue of approximately 6.2 million is primarily attributable to a full period of operations for 24 properties in 2024, compared to a full period of operations for 15 properties and partial period of operations for nine properties acquired in the first nine months of 2023, as well as lease up of our non-stabilized properties. We expect total revenues to increase in the future commensurate with our future acquisition activity and lease-up of our non-stabilized properties.

Foreign currency adjustment consists of changes in foreign currency related to our net investments in real estate facilities and unconsolidated real estate ventures in Canada, not classified as long term in accordance with GAAP. We expect foreign currency adjustment to change in the future based upon changes in exchange rates, as well as future net investments in real estate in currencies other than United States dollars. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 A comparison of cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended

291,829,079 

(281,967,301) 

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.1 million and approximately 10.5) million, respectively, a change of approximately 10.6 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of an increase in amounts due to affiliates. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 9.5 million and approximately 261.8 million, respectively, a change of approximately 252.3 million. The decrease in cash used in our investing activities is primarily the result of cash used for the purchase of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 9.9 million and approximately 291.8 million, respectively, a change of approximately 281.9 million. The decrease in cash provided by our financing activities is primarily the result of a decrease in net debt proceeds totaling 126.8 
 57 

million and net proceeds raised from issuance of preferred equity 150 million that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs consist primarily of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, debt service payments, capital expenditures, property acquisitions, development costs for joint venture and wholly owned investments and distributions to our stockholders, preferred stockholders and limited partners in our Operating Partnership, as necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. We generally expect that we will meet our short-term liquidity requirements from the combination of cash on hand, proceeds from our Primary Offering, proceeds from secured and unsecured financing from banks or other lenders, impound reserve accounts for interest and net cash provided from property operations. 
 Volatility in the debt and equity markets and continued and/or further impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other economic events will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. While we do not expect such events to have a material impact upon our liquidity in the short-term, continued uncertainty or deterioration in the debt and equity markets over an extended period of time could potentially impact our liquidity over the long-term. 
 The National Bank of Canada - North York Loan, First National Loan, Bank of Montreal Loan, National Bank of Canada - Burlington and National Bank of Canada - Ontario Loan mature in the next 12 months. We are evaluating multiple options to satisfy these loan maturities before they come due, which include extending the maturity date of the loans, exercising extension options, amending the loans with the current lender or refinancing with a different lender. 
 Distribution Policy and Distributions 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 The shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock rank senior to all other shares of our capital stock, including our common stock, with respect to rights to receive dividends and to participate in distributions or payments upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Dividends payable on each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will initially be equal to a rate of 8.35 per annum, which accrues daily but is payable quarterly in arrears. If the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has not been redeemed on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the Initial Closing, the dividend rate will increase an additional 0.75 per annum each year thereafter to a maximum of 11.0 per annum until the tenth anniversary of the Initial Closing, at which time the dividend rate shall increase 0.75 per annum each year thereafter until the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is either converted or repurchased in full. 
 Common Stock 
 We commenced paying distributions to our stockholders in March 2021 and intend to continue to pay regular distributions to our stockholders. From the commencement of paying cash distributions in March 2021, 100 of our cash distributions have been paid from the net proceeds of our Private Offering and our Public Offering. Until we are generating operating cash flow sufficient to fund distributions to our stockholders, we may decide to make stock distributions or to make distributions using a combination of stock and cash, or to fund some or all of our distributions from the proceeds of our Private Offering, proceeds of our Public Offering or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties. Because substantially all of our operations will be performed indirectly through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay distributions depends in large part on our Operating Partnership s ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. In the event we do not have enough cash from operations to fund cash distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund the distributions or make the distributions out of net proceeds from our Public Offering. Therefore, it is likely that some or all of the distributions that we make will represent a return of capital to stockholders, at least in the first few years of operation. Though we have no present intention to make in-kind distributions, we are authorized by our charter to make in-kind distributions of readily marketable securities, distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of the charter or distributions that meet all of the following conditions: (a) our board of directors advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property; (b) our board of directors offers each stockholder the election of receiving such in-kind distributions; and (c) in-kind distributions are only made to those stockholders who accept such offer. 
 Distributions will be paid to our stockholders as of the record date selected by our board of directors. We pay distributions monthly based on daily declaration and record dates so that investors may be entitled to distributions immediately upon purchasing our shares. We expect to continue to regularly pay distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors inhibit us from doing so. Distributions will be authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, which will be directed, in substantial part, by its obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. Our board of directors may increase, decrease or eliminate the distribution rate that is being paid at any time. Distributions will be made on all classes of our common stock at the same time. The per share amount of distributions on different classes of shares will likely differ because of different allocations of class-specific expenses. Specifically, distributions on Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares and Class 
 58 

Z shares will likely be lower than distributions on Class A shares and Class P shares because Class T shares and Class Y shares are subject to ongoing stockholder servicing fees and Class W shares and Class Z shares are subject to ongoing dealer manager servicing fees. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 the amount of time required for us to invest the funds received in the offerings; 

our operating and interest expenses; 

the amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments; 

our ability to keep our properties occupied; 

our ability to maintain or increase rental rates; 

the performance of our lease-up, development and redevelopment properties; 

any significant delays in construction for development or redevelopment properties; 

construction defects or capital improvements; 

capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures; 

the issuance of additional shares; and 

financings and refinancings. 

Dividends with respect to the outstanding shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 

We must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year in order to meet the requirements for being treated as a REIT under the Code. Our directors may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as they deem appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter, bylaws or investment policies, and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash, which could reduce the value of our stockholders' investments in our shares. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of investors capital. 
 We have not been able to and may not be able to pay distributions from our cash flows from operations, in which case distributions may be paid in part from debt financing or from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our offerings. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flows from operations may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
 Over the long-term, we expect that a greater percentage of our distributions will be paid from cash flows from operations. However, our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including our ability to raise and invest capital at favorable yields, the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment and the types and mix of investments in our portfolio. As a result, future distributions declared and paid may exceed cash flow from operations. 
 The following shows our cash distributions and the sources of such cash distributions for the respective periods presented:

From our inception through September 30, 2024, we have paid cumulative distributions of approximately 43.4 million, as compared to cumulative net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 98.4 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid distributions of approximately 19.5 million, as compared to a net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 34.3 million. Net loss attributable to our common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects non-cash depreciation and amortization of approximately 12.1 million and acquisition related expenses of approximately 0.6 million. 
 From our inception through September 30, 2024, cumulative net loss attributable to our common stockholders reflects non-cash depreciation and amortization of approximately 34.6 million, and acquisition related expenses of approximately 5.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid distributions of approximately 10.3 million, as compared to a net loss attributable to our common stockholders of approximately 28.9 million. Net loss attributable to our common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflects non-cash depreciation and amortization of approximately 10.7 million and acquisition related expenses of approximately 1.4 million. 
 Indebtedness 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness was approximately 284.6 million which included approximately 285.6 million of variable rate debt less approximately 1.0 million in net debt issuance costs. See Note 5 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for more information about our indebtedness. 
 Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for property acquisitions, either directly or through entity interests, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to the following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Debt Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024 excluding the impact of our interest rate hedging activities, future cash payments for interest on debt over the next 12 months is approximately 21.2 million. As of September 30, 2024 future cash payments for maturing debt over the next 12 months is approximately 145.0 million. We expect to meet these future obligations with a combination of proceeds from our Primary Offering, operations, exercising debt extension options and future debt financing. 

Commitments and contingencies Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

60 

Potential acquisitions, investments in Joint Ventures Refer to Note 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Long-term potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, issuance of equity instruments and undistributed funds from operations. To the extent we are not able to secure requisite financing in the form of a credit facility or other debt, we will be dependent upon proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and cash flows from operating activities in order to meet our long-term liquidity requirements and to fund our distributions.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have joint ventures with SmartCentres, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other than the foregoing, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 Subsequent Events 
 Please see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 Seasonality 
 We believe that we will experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our facilities which we believe will be slightly higher over the summer months due to increased moving activity.

ITEM 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk and to a lesser extent, foreign currency risk. We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund acquisition, expansion, and financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness was approximately 284.6 million, which included approximately 285.6 million in variable rate debt less approximately 1.0 million in net debt issuance costs. A change in interest rates on variable debt could impact the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value. If the underlying rate of the related index on our variable rate debt were to increase by 100 basis points, the increase in interest, net of our interest rate derivatives, would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 0.3 million annually. 
 Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 
 The following table summarizes future debt maturities and average interest rates on our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024:

(1) Interest expense on variable rate debt was calculated based on the rate in effect on September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives. The Huntington Credit Facility, National Bank of Canada - Burlington Loan, National Bank of Canada - Cambridge Loan, National Bank of Canada - North York, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada - Ontario loan have variable rates, however, we entered into interest rate caps or swap agreements that fix SOFR at 2.12 , CORRA at 4.02 , CORRA at 3.83 , CORRA at 3.79 , CORRA at 4.47 and CORRA at 4.73 respectively until the maturity of the loan. Debt denominated in foreign currency has been converted based on the rate in effect as of September 30, 2024. 

Currently, our only foreign exchange rate risk comes from our Canadian properties, investments in our Canadian joint ventures and the Canadian Dollar CAD ). We generate all of our revenues and expend essentially all of our operating expenses and third party CAD-denominated debt service cost related to our Canadian properties in CAD. As a result of fluctuations in currency exchange, our cash flows and results of operations could be affected. 
 ITEM 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our 
 62 

Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. 	 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 . 
 ITEM 1A. 	 RI SK FACTORS 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We have incurred a net loss to date, have an accumulated deficit and our operations may not be profitable in 2024. 
 We incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our accumulated deficit was approximately 98.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Given that we are still early in our fundraising and acquisition stage, our operations may not be profitable in 2024. 
 The risk factor captioned This is a fixed price offering and the offering price for each class of our shares was arbitrarily determined and may not accurately represent the current value of our assets at any particular time. Therefore, the purchase price you pay for shares of our common stock may be higher than the value of our assets per share of our common stock at the time of your purchase, and the risk factor with the caption beginning We will be required to disclose an estimated value per share of our common stock prior to, or shortly after, the conclusion of this offering, and such estimated value per share may be lower than the purchase price you pay for shares of our common stock in this offering. The estimated value per share may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our assets and liabilities and likely will not represent the amount of net proceeds that would result if we were liquidated or dissolved or completed a merger or other sale of our company are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following: 
 We may only calculate the net asset value per share for our shares annually and, therefore, you may not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during this offering. 
 On August 7, 2024, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share for our Class P shares, Class A shares, Class T shares, Class W shares, Class Y shares, and Class Z shares of 10.00 as of March 31, 2024. Our board of directors approved this estimated value per share pursuant to rules promulgated by FINRA, which, in our case, require us to disclose an estimated per share value of our shares based on a valuation no later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we commenced our Public Offering. When determining the estimated value per share from and after 150 days following the second anniversary of the date we commenced our Public Offering and annually thereafter, there are currently no SEC, federal and state rules that establish requirements specifying the methodology to employ in determining an estimated value per share; provided, however, that the determination of the estimated value per share must be conducted by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service and must be derived from a methodology that conforms to standard industry practice. 
 We intend to use this estimated per share value of our shares until the next net asset valuation approved by our board of directors, which we are required to approve at least annually. We may not calculate the net asset value per share for our shares more than annually. Therefore, you may not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during this offering. 
 63 

In determining our estimated value per share, we primarily relied upon a valuation of our portfolio of properties as of March 31, 2024. Valuations and appraisals of our properties are estimates of fair value and may not necessarily correspond to realizable value upon the sale of such properties, therefore our estimated net asset value per share may not reflect the amount that would be realized upon a sale of each of our properties. 
 For the purposes of calculating the estimated value per share, an independent third party appraiser valued our properties as of March 31, 2024. The valuation methodologies used to value our properties involved certain subjective judgments. Ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions beyond our control and the control of our Advisor and independent appraiser. Further, valuations do not necessarily represent the price at which an asset would sell, since market prices of assets can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller.Therefore, the valuations of our properties and our investments in real estate related assets may not correspond to the timely realizable value upon a sale of those assets. Because the price you will pay for shares in this offering is primarily based on the estimated net asset value per share, you may pay more than realizable value when you purchase your shares or receive less than realizable value for your investment when you sell your shares. 
 The offering price of our shares may not be indicative of the price at which our shares would trade if they were actively traded, and our estimated net asset value per share may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our assets and liabilities and likely will not represent the amount of net proceeds that would result if we were liquidated or dissolved or completed a merger or other sale of our company. 
 Our board of directors determined the offering price of our shares based upon a number of factors but primarily based on the estimated per share value of our shares determined by our board of directors. There are no established criteria for valuing issued or outstanding shares of companies like us. Therefore, our offering price may not be indicative of either the price at which our shares would trade if they were listed on a national exchange or actively traded by brokers or of the proceeds that a stockholder would receive if we were liquidated or dissolved and the proceeds were distributed to our stockholders. 
 Our current share price is primarily based on our estimated value per share, which was based on an estimate of the value of our properties consisting principally of illiquid commercial real estate as of March 31, 2024. The valuation methodologies used by the independent appraiser retained by our board of directors to estimate the value of our portfolio of properties as of March 31, 2024 involved subjective judgments, assumptions, and opinions, which may or may not turn out to be correct. In addition, our board of directors based our share price primarily on the estimated value per share which, although heavily reliant upon the independent appraisal, involved certain subjective judgments, assumptions, and opinions of management. As a result, our share price may not reflect the precise amount that might be paid to for your shares in a market transaction.

ITEM 2. 	 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 (a) Distribution Reinvestment Plan - Class P Shares 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, through our distribution reinvestment plan, we have issued approximately 73,000 Class P shares to investors who originally purchased shares in our Private Offering, for gross proceeds of approximately 0.7 million. No sales commissions or dealer manager fees are paid in connection with the sale of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. Each of the purchasers of our shares of common stock under our Private Offering has represented that he or she is an accredited investor. Based upon these representations, we believe that the foregoing issuances of our shares of Class P common stock were exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Rule 506 and Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 On June 26, 2024, we issued 2,500 shares of restricted stock to each of our independent board members for their services as our directors. The issuance of these securities was affected without registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a sale by the Company not involving a public offering. No underwriters were involved with the issuance of such securities. 
 (b) On March 17, 2022, our Public Offering (SEC File No. 333-256598) of up to 1.0 billion in shares of our common stock in our Primary Offering was declared effective by the SEC, consisting of five classes of shares: Class A shares for 10.33 per share (up to 450 million in shares), Class T shares for 10.00 per share (up to 450 million in shares), Class W shares for 9.40 per share (up to 100 million in shares), Class Y shares for 9.30 per share (up to 800 in shares), and Class Z shares for 9.30 per share (up to 200 million in shares) and up to 95 million in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan at 9.30 per share for Class A, Class T, Class W, Class Y and Class Z shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had sold approximately 2.9 million Class A shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 30.3 million, approximately 4.8 million Class T shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 48.1 million, approximately 0.7 million Class W shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 6.3 million, approximately 3.1 million Class Y shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 29.4 million and approximately 0.3 million Class Z shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately 2.3 million pursuant to our Primary Offering. Through our distribution reinvestment plan, we have issued approximately 0.1 million Class A shares, approximately 0.2 million Class T shares, approximately 31,000 Class W shares, approximately 38,000 Class Y shares and approximately 2,100 Class Z shares for gross proceeds of approximately 3.9 million. We have incurred approximately 10.2 million in sales commissions and dealer manager fees (of which approximately 4.9 million was re-allowed to a third party broker-dealer) in connection with the Primary Offering, and approximately 4.5 million in organization and offering costs. 

(c) Our share redemption program enables our stockholders to have their shares redeemed by us, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described in our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (SEC Registration No. 333-256598). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we redeemed shares as follows:
