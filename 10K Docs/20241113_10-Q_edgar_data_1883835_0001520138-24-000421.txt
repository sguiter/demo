of ownership on January 16, 2023. ESG, ESG China Limited, and Hainan ESG have no operations. 

On September 28, 2023, ESG entered into a share exchange agreement
with Funan Allied United Farmer Products Co., Ltd., a China corporation incorporated in May 2017 AUFP ), and 74.52 of shareholders
of AUFP, (each a Shareholder, and collectively, the Shareholders ), through Hainan ESG. Pursuant to such agreement,
the Shareholders exchanged their equity of AUFP to Hainan ESG for shares of common stock of ESG, and ESG has agreed to offer of
ESG shares. Following this transaction, AUFP became a subsidiary of ESG through Hainan ESG. 

AUFP incorporated Anhui Allied United Mushroom Technology Co., Ltd. AUMT in China in March 2018 to manufacture white button mushroom compost while AUFP incorporated Anhui Allied United Mushroom
Co., Ltd. AUM in China in April 2018 to grow fresh white button mushrooms and provide mushroom growing management services.
AUFP, AUMT, and AUM are operating entities in China. 

Prior to the share exchange, Mr. Zhi Yang owned of AUFP,
Fuyang Zhihan Agricultural Information Co. Ltd. Zhihan owned of AUFP and Mr. Chris Alonzo owned of
AUFP. ESG, after the share exchange agreement described above is completed, owns of AUFP and its subsidiaries, AUM and
AUMT in China. Currently Mr. Zhi Yang and Zhihan control of ESG through DCG China Limited , and Mr. Christopher Alonzo
owns of ESG. 

Since the Company is effectively controlled by the same controlling
shareholders before and after the share exchange agreement, it is considered under common control. Therefore the above mentioned transactions
were accounted for as a recapitalization. The reorganization has been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if
the aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying financial statements
of the Company. 

Our operating subsidiaries are involved in direct white button mushroom
composting, growing, food production, distribution, as well as import and export of Phase III compost and food to strategize. With the
core business philosophy to develop and operate sustainable and technology-driven food businesses consistent with the principles of Environmental,
Sustainable, and Governance investing, we believe that the growing global demand for sustainable high quality food presents a unique opportunity
to operate companies engaged in this critical area that is being paid increasing attention by global investors.

Legal contingencies 

Management has identified certain legal mattes where we believe an
unfavorable outcome is resonably estimated. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of
currently pending proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

OPERATIONS REVIEW 

Net Operating Revenues 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended
September 30, 2023 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net operating revenues
were 122,041, compared to net loss of 17,722 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 139,763 or 789 . 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus nine Months Ended
September 30, 2023 

During the nine months ended September 30 2024, net operating loss
was 262,096, compared to 127,150 of net operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 389,246, or
306 . 

The decrease was due to the testing of expanded facility. After the
expansion of triple capacity is completed, the Company started testing the expanded facility. From late July the expansion operates at
3 times of the capacity in 2023. We passed the testing phase this quarter and We expect the revenue and gross profit margin will increase
in the fourth quarter. 

Gross Profit Margin 

Gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit
by net operating revenues. Our gross profit margin increased to 22.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80.34 
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit margin decreased to 11.94 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to 24.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the testing phase of expansion
facility. We expect commodity costs to have a favorable impact on our gross profit margin during the fourth quart of 2024 after the expansion
operation testing phases out and reaches its full capacity. 

Research and Development Expenses 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Research and development
expenses decreased 8,257, or 5.40 , compared to 416,333 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, Research and development expenses decreased 52,940, or 11.58 , compared to 457,306 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The difference was mainly due to the increase of currency exchange rate used to translate financial statements. 

Selling, General Administrative Expenses 

During the three months ended September, 2024, selling expenses
increased 1,029, or 81.45 , compared to 1,263 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 40,297, or 14.39 , compared to 279,953 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling expenses increased 2,913, or 156 , compared to
 1,863, general and administrative expenses decreased 173,193, or 19.77 , compared to 876,271 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease of professional fee and the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rate. 

Interest Expense 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense
was decreased 187,933 or 300 , compared to negative 62,533 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Negative 62,533 of interest
expense was due to the interest forgiveness by the loaner during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, interest expenses were decreased 119,851, or 41.74 , compared to 287,134 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the reduce of loans and interest forgiveness. 

- 15 - 

Other income (loss) 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, other loss was
 180, compared to 29,652 of net income during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 29,832, or 101 . During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, other loss was 15,605, compared to 133,180 of net income during the nine months ended
