Independent Auditor's Report 
 To the Board of Directors 
 National Property REIT Corp. 

Opinion 
 
 We have audited the combined consolidated financial statements of National Property REIT Corp. (the Company ), which comprise the combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and the related combined consolidated statements of operations, changes in (deficit) equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the combined consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Predecessor Auditor s Opinion on 2022 Financial Statements 
 
 The financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated August 10, 2023, expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

1 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we 
 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
 
 We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 a. Principles of Reporting and Use of Estimates 
 The accompanying combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. 
 Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of a property s purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, revenue recognition, and determining whether an asset is impaired. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. 
 As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 b. Basis of Consolidation and Transfers of Financial Assets 
 The accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned or controlled by us. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the combined consolidated balance sheets and the presentation of net income (loss) is modified to present the net income (loss) attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests. 
 9 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For a variable interest entity VIE ), an entity is subject to consolidation if the equity investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity s activities or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns. VIEs that meet certain scope characteristics are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This determination can sometimes involve complex and subjective analysis. We are required on an ongoing basis to assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. 
 We may periodically enter into transactions in which we sell financial assets. Upon a transfer of financial assets, we may retain or acquire senior or subordinated interests in the related assets. In connection with such transactions, a determination must be made as to whether we, as the transferor, have surrendered control over transferred financial assets. That determination must consider our continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets, including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer, even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer. The financial components approach under applicable GAAP limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. It defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale. 
 From time to time, we may securitize unsecured consumer loans we hold if such securitization allows us access to better financing terms. Depending upon the structure of the securitization transaction, these transactions will be accounted for as either a sale and the loans will be removed from the combined consolidated balance sheets or as a financing with the loans and financing reported on our combined consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment may be exercised by us in determining whether a transaction should be recorded as a sale or a financing. 
 In determining the accounting treatment to be applied to securitization transactions, we evaluate whether the entity used to facilitate the transactions was a VIE and, if so, whether the VIE should be consolidated. Based on our evaluations, we have concluded that one of our securitizations is a VIE that should be consolidated. The Company has determined that the other securitizations that we participated in should not be consolidated since, among other things, we concluded that the transfer of the underlying assets qualified as a sale. 
 c. Purchase Accounting and Acquisitions of Real Estate 
 Prior to the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01 in January 2018, the Company recorded the acquisition of real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination were measured at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-01, the Company records the acquisition of real estate that will be used for the production of income as an asset acquisition, with all assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition costs are capitalized and allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. The Company assesses the acquisition date fair values of all tangible assets, and identified lease intangibles, consisting of in-place leases, tenant relationships, deferred leasing costs, and above-market and below-market leases. 
 Real estate assets, including land, building and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs associated with the development, construction and improvement of the Company s real estate assets are capitalized as incurred. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred, while major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the useful life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives. 
 10 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 The Company records depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows 
 Category Term Building 15 to 54 years Improvements 2 to 14 years Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 2 to 14 years 
 Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 105,409,244 and 96,897,855, respectively, and is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying combined consolidated statements of operations. 
 The value of acquired land, buildings and improvements is estimated by formal appraisals, observed comparable sales transactions and information gathered during pre-acquisition due diligence activities. The valuation approach considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The values of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated by calculating their replacement cost and reducing that value by factors based upon estimates of their remaining useful lives. 
 The value allocated to acquired lease intangibles is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the remaining term of the lease and the tenant s credit quality, among other factors. 
 The value of in-place leases and deferred leasing costs are amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases, which range from less than a year to seventeen years. The amount allocated to acquire in-place leases is determined by calculating the estimated time to fill a hypothetically empty property to its stabilization level based on historical observed move-in rates for each property. The intangible assets are calculated by estimating the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. The amount allocated to deferred leasing costs is determined by what the Company would have paid to a third-party to secure a new tenant reduced by the expired term of the respective lease. The value of tenant relationships is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals, which is thirty seven years. The amount allocated to tenant relationships is the benefit resulting from the likelihood of a tenant renewing its lease. Acquired intangible assets generally have no residual value. Amortization expense related to these assets was 494,650 and 23,597,558 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 d. Impairment of Real Estate 
 The Company reviews the carrying value of its real estate assets and intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such reviews indicate that the asset may be impaired, given that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of its expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, the asset s carrying amount is written down to its fair value. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to real estate assets. 
 e. Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
 The Company classifies certain real estate assets as held for sale on the combined consolidated balance sheets once the criteria, as defined by GAAP, have been met. Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value minus cost to sell and are no longer depreciated. The Company reports discontinued operations when the disposal of real estate assets represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results. No disposal met the definition of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 f. Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was 
 11 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. The Company recognizes a liability for environmental matters if it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company is not aware of any environmental matters that would have an impact on the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 g. Fair Value Measurements 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, in the principal or most advantageous market considering the highest and best use of an asset or nonperformance risk related to a liability, at the measurement date. The Company uses the most observable inputs that are available to measure fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s views about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 
 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
 Level 2 - observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data and 
 Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. 
 The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considering counterparty credit risk, where applicable, in the Company s assessment of fair value. 
 The Company carries its mortgages payable, debt related to consolidated VIE, preferred equity investment, and senior secured term loan at cost, net of unamortized discount, debt issuance costs, and associated amortization, on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 h. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825 ), which provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, the Company has made an election to measure its unsecured consumer loans, residual interest in securitizations, CLOs, corporate bonds, interest rate caps, and reverse repurchase facilities at fair value on the combined consolidated balance sheets. We elected to use the fair value option to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Under this election, (a) unsecured consumer loans charged off, recoveries, and realized gains (losses), and (b) net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the unsecured consumer loans, residual interest in securitizations, CLOs, corporate bonds, interest rate caps, and reverse repurchase facilities are recorded as fair value adjustments on the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
 i. Revenue Recognition 
 Rental revenues from residential, student housing, and self-storage tenants are recognized on a contractual basis, as lease periods for these investments are short term in nature. Tenant receivables that are deemed uncollectible are recognized as a reduction to rental revenue. The Company recognizes reimbursement for utilities and other expenses recoveries as other revenue when earned. Rental revenues from industrial and commercial tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The industrial and commercial leases contain rental increases at specified intervals. The Company records as an asset, and includes in rental revenues, deferred rent receivable that will be received if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. Deferred rent receivable in the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the respective lease terms. 
 12 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 Rental income can be comprised of fixed and variable lease payments. The following table shows the details of rental income for the year ended December 31, 2023 
 Fixed rent 318,320,196 Less write-off of tenant receivables (12,856,269) Total rental income 305,463,927 
 Minimum future rental receipts under the noncancelable portion of commercial and industrial tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases, for the next five years and thereafter are as follows 
 Year Rental Receipts 2024 556,468 2025 209,968 2026 209,968 2027 209,968 2028 209,968 Thereafter 86,911 
 Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, our unsecured consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan is greater than 60 days contractually delinquent or charged off, which may occur if a borrower were to declare bankruptcy prior to a loan being 60 days delinquent, at which point the associated interest receivable balance is reversed against the interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. For residual interests in securitizations, interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Under this method, we recognize as interest income, over the life of the securities, the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over the securities' carrying value. We update our estimates of expected cash flows quarterly and recognize changes in the calculated effective interest rate on a prospective basis. For certain investments held by the Company, cash not received for interest may be recorded through a payment-in-kind PIK ). Interest income recorded as PIK is recognized as income in the period earned. 
 Gains and losses on the sale of real estate are recognized pursuant to ASC 610, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets . Any gain or loss on sale is measured based on the difference between the amount of consideration received and the carrying amount of the sold real estate asset, less costs to sell. For a partial sale of real estate resulting in a transfer of control, the Company measures any non-controlling interest retained at fair value, and recognizes a gain or loss on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the real estate assets retained. 
 j. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers all highly-liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes funds deposited with financial institutions and sh ort-term, highly-liquid overnight investment in money market funds. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 66,567,915 and 35,212,438, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 19,072,596 and 69,524 of the cash and cash equivalents, respectively, disclosed on the combined consolidated balance sheets represent investments in money market funds, with the remainder held in deposit accounts, substantially all of which exceeded applicable insurance limits. 
 k. Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash consists of cash escrowed under the operating agreements and mortgage agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance, and capital improvements and other restricted deposits. The Company had restricted cash of 36,248,212 and 37,869,284 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash was 102,816,127 and 73,081,722 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 l. Unsecured Consumer Loans 
 Unsecured consumer loans consist of individual loans purchased from various originators of unsecured consumer loans Lending Platforms under terms of the Company s agreement with the respective platforms, who are sellers of the unsecured consumer loans that continue to service such loans. Unsecured consumer 
 13 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 loans made through the Lending Platforms are issued by WebBank, an FDIC-insured, Utah chartered industrial bank, except for loans issued by NBT. After funding a loan, WebBank sells the loan to the Lending Platform, without recourse, in exchange for the principal amount of the loan. Loans issued by NBT are purchased by the Company as part of a loan purchase and sale agreement between ACL PS, NBT and Springstone. All loans purchased are unsecured obligations of individual borrowers with a fixed interest rate and loan terms set between 12 and 84 months. Unsecured consumer loans are recorded on the date purchased by the Company, which is generally at least fifteen days after origination. Unsecured consumer loans are charged off in the month that the loan becomes greater than 120 days contractually delinquent or in the month that the borrower has entered bankruptcy, at which point the outstanding principal amount is written off against the total balance of the unsecured consumer loans on the combined consolidated balance sheets. This results in a fair value adjustment on the combined consolidated statements of operations. Recoveries on charged off loans and sales of charged off loans to third-parties are recorded as received, net of fees. 
 m. Due from Lending Platforms 
 LendingClub is an online marketplace lending platform from which we purchase unsecured consumer loans. The Due from LendingClub Corporation amounts presented on the combined consolidated balance sheets represent cash deposited at LendingClub. 
 n. Accounts Receivable Deemed Uncollectible 
 The Company monitors its accounts receivable on a tenant-by-tenant basis and if cash collection is deemed not probable, the Company establishes a full reserve for the individual tenant's outstanding balance. For the remaining receivable balance, the Company establishes and maintains a general reserve reflecting the Company's expectation that a portion of the operating receivables will not be collected. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 5,172,932 and 3,129,901, respectively, was deemed uncollectible and is included as accounts receivable within the combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 o. Asset Management and Management Services 
 Management fee expenses are recognized when incurred in accordance with the terms of each respective management agreement. 
 p. Debt Issuance Costs and Unamortized Debt Discounts 
 The Company defers costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing and amortizes the costs using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method, over the terms of the related debt as a component of interest expense. The Company also recognizes a debt discount or premium in connection with mortgages assumed at fair value in accordance with ASC 805 . Debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discounts have been presented as a direct deduction to our mortgages payable, mortgages payable related to real estate assets held for sale, debt related to consolidated VIE, and senior secured term loans in the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had net debt issuance costs and debt discounts of 26,351,634 and 19,258,121, respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts of 8,240,872 and 7,440,085 is included in interest expense in the combined consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 q. Non-controlling Interests 
 Non-controlling interests are comprised of the Company s joint venture partners interests in the joint ventures in real estate properties that the Company consolidates. The Company reports its joint venture partners interests in its consolidated real estate joint ventures and other subsidiary interests held by third-parties as non-controlling interests. The Company records these non-controlling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investments net income or loss and equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are generally allocated pro rata based on the respective ownership percentages until the venture reaches certain performance measures, at which time the other venture party will be entitled to preferred distributions (profit interests). 
 r. Income Taxes 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Company believes it operates in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company 
 14 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its taxable income. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including, among others, a requirement that it currently distributes at least 90 of its taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain adjustments. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year without the benefit of certain relief provisions, it will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state or local taxes on its income, property or net worth and federal taxes and excise taxes on its undistributed income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS will be fully subject to federal, state and local income taxes. 
 The Company accounts for TRS income taxes under the liability method as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of the TRS income, assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, several of the Company's subsidiaries were considered taxable corporations for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries are subject to corporate level U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their net taxable income. 
 ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the combined consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits. Management s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We file tax returns for U.S. federal, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitation is open for all jurisdictions for tax years beginning in 2018. 
 The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties on tax positions, if any, as expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, no interest and penalties have been accrued. 
 s. Concentration of Counterparty Risk and Credit Risk 
 In the normal course of its business, the Company encounters counterparty risk and credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, principal and interest outstanding on unsecured consumer loans, and amounts deposited with each of the Company's Lending Platforms. Counterparty risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us. 
 t. Servicing, Collection and Upfront Fees 
 The Company incurs a monthly servicing fee for each outstanding unsecured consumer loan, which is payable to the Lending Platforms for managing payments from borrowers and maintaining loan account portfolios. The Company incurs collection fees on amounts recovered from delinquent loans, which is payable to the Lending Platforms. The Company incurs an upfront fee on unsecured consumer loans purchased from Avant. All servicing, collection and upfront fees are expensed as incurred. 
 u. Collateralized Loan Obligations CLOs 
 The Company holds investments in CLOs which are subordinated debt interests in syndicated loans managed by third-party collateral managers with industry experience. The outstanding investments range in expected maturity from October 2026 to April 2032 and pays interest based on the three-month SOFR 3MS plus 5.20 to 9.23 . 
 CLOs purchased are recorded on the trade date. Primary CLOs purchased either from the collateral manager or the broker are recorded on the settled date, to reflect the potential changes, updates or resizing of the position, due to the long-term nature of settlement. The typical settlement time for Depository Trust Company bonds is three days. Amortization of an original issue discount is calculated to expected maturity date, based on projected cash flows at the time of purchase, and recorded over the expected life of the bond. 
 Gains or losses from the sale of CLOs are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale. Restructured or permanently impaired CLOs are recorded in the period of measurement and recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations as 
 15 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 a realized gain or loss and amortized to expected maturity based on the available cash flows at the time of measurement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 v. Corporate bonds 
 The Company holds corporate bonds comprised of investment grade and high yield corporate bonds including performing credit strategies focused on income-oriented, senior loan and bond investment strategies targeting U.S. issuers. 
 Secondary corporate bonds purchased from a broker are recorded on a trade date basis and are recorded as the settlement value of cash, plus purchased accrued interest. Purchased accrued interest is treated as a return of capital upon receipt of coupon. The discount to par is amortized over the stated maturity of the corporate bond and recognized as part of interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. Gains or losses from the sale of Corporate Bonds are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 w. Interest rate caps 
 In order to manage the risks associated with the variable rate financing of the mortgage, the Company may enter into various interest rate cap agreements. The cap agreements have initial notional values equal to the original loan amount of the related mortgages. 
 Derivative instruments not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value on the combined consolidated balance sheets with any change in fair value reflected in the combined consolidated statement of operations in the period of change. The fair value of the interest rate caps as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 20,203,768 and 25,724,128, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was loss of 7,684,262 and gain of 14,067,690, respectively, recorded for the fair value of the interest rate caps. 
 x. Recent accounting pronouncements 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, an update to ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period rather than recognizing the credit losses when it is probable that the loss has been incurred in accordance with current GAAP. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, which clarified that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of ASC Topic 326, and instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for under the scope of ASC Topic 842, Leases. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which provides transition relief for entities adopting ASU 2016-13 by allowing entities to elect the fair value option on certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022. This adoption did not have a material impact on the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-04 establishing Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform, and in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Scope (collectively, ASC 848 ). ASC 848 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives, and other contracts. The guidance in ASC 848 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 ASU 2022-06 which was issued to defer the sunset date of ASC 848 to December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has transitioned LIBOR- indexed debt and derivatives to SOFR.

 4. Real Estate Assets 
 The Company s ownership interests in real estate properties range from 67 to 100 via either direct ownership or ownership of a property owning entity. Through its ownership interests, the Company controls and therefore consolidates the properties and property owning entities. The interest owned by the other joint venture partner is reflected as non-controlling interest in these combined consolidated financial statements.

 7. Preferred Equity Investments 
 On November 14, 2022, the Company, together with a joint venture partner, acquired Terraces at Perkins Rowe, a multi-family property located in Baton Rouge, LA for an aggregate purchase price of 41,400,000. The investment is structured as an investment that incorporates debt-like return metrics. The Company receives SOFR + 2 cash return each month with additional 7 paid-in-kind (PIK) accrued to the Company s outstanding capital balance. While there is no stated maturity date for this investment, the Company has a put option at the end of 5-year hold period that it intends to exercise. The de facto maturity date is November 14, 2027. During the year ended 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized total interest income of 1,921,054 and 240,425 from preferred equity investment. The Company's preferred equity investment meets the definition of held-to-maturity debt security, which are reported at amortized cost. The Company determined that as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, fair value of the preferred equity investment approximated its cost of 14,018,973 and 13,073,865, respectively. 
 8. Involuntary Conversions 
 During 2023, the Company did not record any gain or loss from involuntary conversion of real estate assets. 
 During 2022, the Company wrote off real estate assets from fire damages . As of December 31, 2022, proceeds of 3,117,599 were received. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a gain from involuntary conversion of 1,531,629 was recorded in relation to the assessed outcome of the damages and is included as gain loss on involuntary conversions on the combined consolidated statements of operations. 
 9. Unsecured Consumer Loans 
 The Company s portfolio of unsecured consumer loans consists of a large number of small balance homogeneous loans. As of December 31, 2023, the portfolio consisted of 27 loans having an average outstanding principal balance of 3,037 and a maximum balance of 50,000 at the time of origination. As of December 31, 2023, the unsecured consumer loans were issued with stated interest rates ranging from 9.0 to 25.0 with a weighted average interest rate of 15.4 based on outstanding principal of the unsecured consumer loans. As of December 31, 2022, the portfolio consisted of 216 loans having an average outstanding principal balance of 2,430 and maximum balance of 50,000 at the time of origination. As of December 31, 2022, the unsecured consumer loans were issued with stated interest rates ranging from 8.0 to 36.0 with a weighted average interest rate of 18.6 based on outstanding principal of the unsecured consumer loans. 
 The ability of the borrowers of the unsecured consumer loans to repay the Company are affected by their continuing financial stability. The credit risk of the unsecured consumer loans and the residual interest in securitizations is considered to be higher than for secured loans. 
 The Lending Platforms classify the unsecured consumer loans into separately identified pools by rating Rating ), which indicates the expected level of risk associated with the loan. Each Rating corresponds to an estimated average annualized loss rate range as of the time the Rating is given. The estimated annual loss rate for each loan is based primarily on a proprietary custom risk model developed by each of the Lending Platforms using their respective historical data, borrower specific factors and Fair Isaac Corporation score FICO score obtained from a credit

 reporting agency. As part of the Rating determination, the Lending Platforms also consider borrower specific factors such as, but not limited to, credit related inquiries in the last six months and debt-to-income ratio. 
 Ratings are not consistent between Lending Platforms as such the Company stratifies its unsecured consumer loans into separately identified pools based on the FICO score obtained from a credit reporting agency and as provided by each Lending Platform at origination. The stratified pools are designated Super Prime, Prime or Near Prime, and defined as follows Super Prime loans as loans to borrowers with a FICO score of 720 or greater, Prime Loans as loans to borrowers with a FICO score of between 660 and 719 and Near Prime loans as loans to borrowers with a FICO score of between 600 and 659.

 10. Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 NGL invests in the junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation CLO vehicles that in turn own pools of Senior Secured Loans . The credit risk of a CLO is dependent on the underlying assets within the portfolio. For traditional CLOs, the collateral pool primarily consists of first lien, senior secured broadly syndicated bank loans (usually at least 90 of the total portfolio), and it may include a predetermined allowable portion of other asset types such as second lien bank loans (which are highly leveraged) and unsecured debt, as well as middle market loans. 
 Some CLOs consist predominantly of middle market loans as the underlying collateral. The average rating of the underlying collateral is typically single-B, and the leveraged bank loans are typically floating rate, based on SOFR. 
 The securities held at NGL are B or BB rated mezzanine debt that pay a quarterly interest coupon, based on the notional balance held and a fixed spread plus SOFR, which resets after each payment. The principal is returned through the CLO waterfall at the earlier of the call date or maturity. As of December 31, 2023, based on outstanding notional balance, 12.3 of the portfolio was invested in single-B rated tranches and 87.7 of the portfolio in BB rated tranches with a fixed spread plus LIBOR and or SOFR at the most recent reset date.

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding investment of CLOs comprised of 97 investments with a fair value of 418,761,852 and a face value of 447,833,784. The average outstanding note is approximately 4,617,000 with an expected maturity date ranging from October 2026 to April 2032 and a weighted average expected maturity of 6.0 years as of December 31, 2023. Coupons range from three-month SOFR 3MS plus 5.20 to 9.23 with a weighted average coupon of 3MS + 6.63 . 
 As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding investment of CLOs comprised of 94 investments with a fair value of 424,746,173 and a face value of approximately 448,235,434. The average outstanding note is approximately 4,768,000 with a stated maturity date ranging from April 2026 to October 2033 and a weighted average stated maturity of 6.0 years as of December 31, 2022. Coupons range from three-month LIBOR 3ML plus 5.20 to 9.23 with a weighted average coupon of 3ML + 6.93 . 
 The Company purchased 14,876,274 and 186,569,431, respectively, of CLOs from various third-party brokers during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are held by the Bank of New York Mellon as custodian. 
 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that financial instrument is transacted. 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. 
 Most of our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, NGL s CLO portfolio was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 at January 1, 2022 due to the volatility of the observable inputs, which were caused primarily by rising interest rates. The net change in unrealized (losses) gains on the investments that use Level 3 inputs was 1,276,630 as of December 31, 2022. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, NGL s repurchase agreements were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 at January 1, 2023 and are held at cost. 
 
 Unsecured Consumer Loans, Residual Interests in Securitizations and Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 The unsecured consumer loans, residual interests in securitizations, and collateralized loan obligations do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. For the unsecured consumer loans and residual interests in securitizations, fair value is estimated by using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon significant unobservable inputs, such as loss adjusted discount rates and projected loss rates. The loss adjusted discount rates are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying unsecured consumer loans, which includes both future principal and interest payments. The projected loss rates are based on the perceived credit risk inherent in each Rating of the unsecured loan portfolio. See Note 9 for details of the unsecured consumer loans. 
 NGL qualifies as an investment company pursuant to ASC Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies . Accordingly, the underlying CLO investments and repurchase agreements are carried at fair value and were retained in consolidation by the Company. 
 In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, management utilizes an independent valuation firm that uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. 
 22 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 The significant unobservable input used to value the CLOs is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which includes both future principal and interest payments. Included in the consideration and selection of the discount rate are the following factors risk of default, comparable investments, and call provisions. An increase or decrease in the discount rate applied to projected cash flows, where all other inputs remain constant, would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value measurement. 
 
 The interests we have acquired in CLOs are generally thinly traded or have only a limited trading market. CLOs are typically privately offered and sold, even in the secondary market. As a result, investments in CLOs may be characterized as illiquid securities. In addition to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, CLO residual interests carry additional risks, including, but not limited to (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default (iii) our investments in CLO tranches will likely be subordinate to other senior classes of note tranches thereof and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the CLO investment or unexpected investment results. Our net asset value may also decline over time if our principal recovery with respect to CLO debt is less than the cost of those investments. Our CLO investments and or the CLOs underlying senior secured loans may prepay more quickly than expected, which could have an adverse impact on our value. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Corporate Bonds, Interest Rate Caps and Repurchase Agreements 
 Secondary corporate bonds purchased from a broker are recorded on a trade date basis and are recorded as the settlement value of cash, plus purchased accrued interest. Purchased accrued interest is treated as a return of capital upon receipt of coupon. The discount to par is amortized over the stated maturity of the corporate bond and recognized as part of interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. The typical settlement time for Depository Trust Company bonds is three days. Gains or losses from the sale or call of Corporate Bonds are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale or call. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 On a recurring basis, the Company measures its interest rate cap at its estimated fair value. In determining the fair value of the Company's derivatives, the Company uses the present value of expected cash flows based on market observable interest rate yield curve commensurate with the term of the instrument. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and that of the respective counterparty in the fair value measurement. The credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by either the respective counterparty or the Company. However, the Company determined that as of December 31, 2023, the impact of the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the derivatives. As a result, the fair value of the derivative is considered to be based primarily on Level 2 inputs. 
 Repurchase agreements are collateralized with a portion of the CLO investments and the carrying value of the repurchase agreement approximates fair value as of December 31, 2023. 
 The following table shows the fair value of our unsecured consumer loans, residual interest in securitizations, CLOs, interest rate caps, corporate bonds, and repurchase agreements, disaggregated into the three levels of the ASC 820 valuation hierarchy as of December 31, 2023.

Independent Auditor's Report 
 To the Board of Directors 
 National Property REIT Corp. 
 
 Opinion 
 
 We have audited the combined consolidated financial statements of National Property REIT Corp., which comprise the combined consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related combined consolidated statements of operations, changes in (deficit) equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Property REIT Corp. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America GAAS ). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of National Property REIT Corp. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the combined consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of combined consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the combined consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about National Property REIT Corp.'s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the combined consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the combined consolidated financial statements. 

1 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we 
 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of National Property REIT Corp.'s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about National Property REIT Corp's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
 
 We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 a. Principles of Reporting and Use of Estimates 
 The accompanying combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. 
 Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of a property s purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, revenue recognition, and determining whether an asset is impaired. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. 
 As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 b. Basis of Consolidation and Transfers of Financial Assets 
 The accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned or controlled by us. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the combined consolidated balance sheets and the presentation of net income (loss) is modified to present the net income (loss) attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests. 
 9 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For a variable interest entity VIE ), an entity is subject to consolidation if the equity investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity s activities or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns. VIEs that meet certain scope characteristics are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This determination can sometimes involve complex and subjective analysis. We are required on an ongoing basis to assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. 
 We may periodically enter into transactions in which we sell financial assets. Upon a transfer of financial assets, we may retain or acquire senior or subordinated interests in the related assets. In connection with such transactions, a determination must be made as to whether we, as the transferor, have surrendered control over transferred financial assets. That determination must consider our continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets, including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer, even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer. The financial components approach under applicable GAAP limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. It defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale. 
 From time to time, we may securitize unsecured consumer loans we hold if such securitization allows us access to better financing terms. Depending upon the structure of the securitization transaction, these transactions will be accounted for as either a sale and the loans will be removed from the combined consolidated balance sheets or as a financing with the loans and financing reported on our combined consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment may be exercised by us in determining whether a transaction should be recorded as a sale or a financing. 
 In determining the accounting treatment to be applied to securitization transactions, we evaluate whether the entity used to facilitate the transactions was a VIE and, if so, whether the VIE should be consolidated. Based on our evaluations, we have concluded that one of our securitizations is a VIE that should be consolidated. The Company has determined that the other securitizations that we participated in should not be consolidated since, among other things, we concluded that the transfer of the underlying assets qualified as a sale. 
 c. Purchase Accounting and Acquisitions of Real Estate 
 Prior to the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01 in January 2018, the Company recorded the acquisition of real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination were measured at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-01, the Company records the acquisition of real estate that will be used for the production of income as an asset acquisition, with all assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Acquisition costs are capitalized and allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. The Company assesses the acquisition date fair values of all tangible assets, and identified lease intangibles, consisting of in-place leases, tenant relationships, deferred leasing costs, and above-market and below-market leases. 
 Real estate assets, including land, building and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs associated with the development, construction and improvement of the Company s real estate assets are capitalized as incurred. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred, while major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the useful life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives. 
 10 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 The Company records depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows 
 Category Term Building 15 to 54 years Improvements 2 to 14 years Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 2 to 14 years 
 Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 96,897,855 and 91,089,441, respectively, and is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying combined consolidated statements of operations. 
 The value of acquired land, buildings and improvements is estimated by formal appraisals, observed comparable sales transactions and information gathered during pre-acquisition due diligence activities. The valuation approach considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The values of furniture, fixtures and equipment are estimated by calculating their replacement cost and reducing that value by factors based upon estimates of their remaining useful lives. 
 The value allocated to acquired lease intangibles is based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the remaining term of the lease and the tenant s credit quality, among other factors. 
 The value of in-place leases and deferred leasing costs are amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases, which range from less than a year to seventeen years. The amount allocated to acquire in-place leases is determined by calculating the estimated time to fill a hypothetically empty property to its stabilization level based on historical observed move-in rates for each property. The intangible assets are calculated by estimating the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. The amount allocated to deferred leasing costs is determined by what the Company would have paid to a third-party to secure a new tenant reduced by the expired term of the respective lease. The value of tenant relationships is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals, which is thirty seven years. The amount allocated to tenant relationships is the benefit resulting from the likelihood of a tenant renewing its lease. Acquired intangible assets generally have no residual value. Amortization expense related to these assets was 23,597,558 and 24,927,864 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 d. Impairment of Real Estate 
 The Company reviews the carrying value of its real estate assets and intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such reviews indicate that the asset may be impaired, given that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of its expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, the asset s carrying amount is written down to its fair value. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to real estate assets. 
 e. Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
 The Company classifies certain real estate assets as held for sale on the combined consolidated balance sheets once the criteria, as defined by GAAP, have been met. Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value minus cost to sell and are no longer depreciated. The Company reports discontinued operations when the disposal of real estate assets represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results. No disposal met the definition of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 f. Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons 
 11 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. The Company recognizes a liability for environmental matters if it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company is not aware of any environmental matters that would have an impact on the combined consolidated financial statements. 
 g. Fair Value Measurements 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, in the principal or most advantageous market considering the highest and best use of an asset or nonperformance risk related to a liability, at the measurement date. The Company uses the most observable inputs that are available to measure fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s views about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 
 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
 Level 2 - observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data and 
 Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. 
 The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considering counterparty credit risk, where applicable, in the Company s assessment of fair value. 
 The Company carries its mortgages payable, debt related to consolidated VIE, preferred equity investment, and senior secured term loan at cost, net of unamortized discount, debt issuance costs, and associated amortization, on the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 h. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825 ), which provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, the Company has made an election to measure its unsecured consumer loans, residual interest in securitizations, CLOs, corporate bonds, interest rate caps, and reverse repurchase facilities at fair value on the combined consolidated balance sheets. We elected to use the fair value option to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Under this election, (a) unsecured consumer loans charged off, recoveries, and realized gains (losses), and (b) net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the unsecured consumer loans, residual interest in securitizations, CLOs, corporate bonds, interest rate caps, and reverse repurchase facilities are recorded as fair value adjustments on the combined consolidated statements of operations.

 i. Revenue Recognition 
 Rental revenues from residential, student housing, and self-storage tenants are recognized on a contractual basis, as lease periods for these investments are short term in nature. Rental revenues are recorded net of bad debts, which include the change in the reserve for uncollectible receivables. The Company recognizes reimbursement for utilities and other expenses recoveries as other revenue when earned. Rental revenues from industrial and commercial tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The industrial and commercial leases contain rental increases at specified intervals. The Company records as an asset, and includes in rental revenues, deferred rent receivable that will be received if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. Deferred rent receivable in the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the respective lease terms. 
 Minimum future rental receipts under the noncancelable portion of commercial and industrial tenant leases, assuming no new or renegotiated leases, for the next five years and thereafter are as follows 1,249,664 (2023), 1,318,339 (2024), 1,318,339 (2025), 1,318,339 (2026), 1,318,339 (2027), and 6,300,557 (thereafter). 
 Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Generally, our unsecured consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan is greater than 60 days contractually delinquent or charged off, which may occur if a borrower were to declare bankruptcy prior to a loan being 60 days delinquent, at which point the associated interest receivable balance is reversed against the interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. For residual interests in securitizations, interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Under this method, we recognize as interest income, over the life of the securities, the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over the securities' carrying value. We update our estimates of expected cash flows quarterly and recognize changes in the calculated effective interest rate on a prospective basis. For certain investments held by the Company, cash not received for interest may be recorded through a payment-in-kind PIK ). Interest income recorded as PIK is recognized as income in the period earned. 
 Gains and losses on the sale of real estate are recognized pursuant to ASC 610, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets . Any gain or loss on sale is measured based on the difference between the amount of consideration received and the carrying amount of the sold real estate asset, less costs to sell. For a partial sale of real estate resulting in a transfer of control, the Company measures any non-controlling interest retained at fair value, and recognizes a gain or loss on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the real estate assets retained. 
 j. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers all highly-liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes funds deposited with financial institutions and sh ort-term, highly-liquid overnight investment in money market funds. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 69,524 and 5,057,364 of the cash and cash equivalents, respectively, disclosed on the combined consolidated balance sheets represent investments in money market funds, with the remainder held in deposit accounts, substantially all of which exceeded applicable insurance limits. 
 k. Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash consists of cash escrowed under the operating agreements and mortgage agreements for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance, and capital improvements and other restricted deposits. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 35,212,438 and 45,488,636, respectively in addition, the Company had restricted cash of 37,869,284 and 39,317,283 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash was 73,081,722 and 84,805,919 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 l. Unsecured Consumer Loans 
 Unsecured consumer loans consist of individual loans purchased from various originators of unsecured consumer loans Lending Platforms under terms of the Company s agreement with the respective platforms, who are sellers of the unsecured consumer loans that continue to service such loans. Unsecured consumer loans made through the Lending Platforms are issued by WebBank, an FDIC-insured, Utah chartered industrial 
 13 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 bank, except for loans issued by NBT. After funding a loan, WebBank sells the loan to the Lending Platform, without recourse, in exchange for the principal amount of the loan. Loans issued by NBT are purchased by the Company as part of a loan purchase and sale agreement between ACL PS, NBT and Springstone. All loans purchased are unsecured obligations of individual borrowers with a fixed interest rate and loan terms set between 12 and 84 months. Unsecured consumer loans are recorded on the date purchased by the Company, which is generally at least fifteen days after origination. Unsecured consumer loans are charged off in the month that the loan becomes greater than 120 days contractually delinquent or in the month that the borrower has entered bankruptcy, at which point the outstanding principal amount is written off against the total balance of the unsecured consumer loans on the combined consolidated balance sheets. This results in a fair value adjustment on the combined consolidated statements of operations. Recoveries on charged off loans and sales of charged off loans to third-parties are recorded as received, net of fees. 
 m. Due from Lending Platforms 
 LendingClub and Prosper are online marketplace Lending Platforms from which we purchase unsecured consumer loans. The Due from LendingClub Corporation and Due from Prosper Funding LLC amounts presented on the combined consolidated balance sheets represent cash deposited at LendingClub and Prosper, respectively. 
 n. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 The Company monitors its accounts receivable on a tenant-by-tenant basis and if cash collection is deemed not probable, the Company establishes a full reserve for the individual tenant's outstanding balance. For the remaining receivable balance, the Company establishes and maintains a general reserve reflecting the Company's expectation that a portion of the operating receivables will not be collected. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, allowance for bad debt was 3,129,901 and 4,944,777, respectively, and is included as accounts receivable within the combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 o. Asset Management and Management Services 
 Management fee expenses are recognized when incurred in accordance with the terms of each respective management agreement. 
 p. Debt Issuance Costs and Unamortized Debt Discounts 
 The Company defers costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing and amortizes the costs using the straight line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method, over the terms of the related debt as a component of interest expense. The Company also recognizes a debt discount or premium in connection with mortgages assumed at fair value in accordance with ASC 805 . Debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discounts have been presented as a direct deduction to our mortgages payable, mortgages payable related to real estate assets held for sale, debt related to consolidated VIE, and senior secured term loans in the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheets. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net debt issuance costs and debt discounts of 19,258,121 and 23,108,088, respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts of 7,440,085 and 6,440,459 is included in interest expense in the combined consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 q. Non-controlling Interests 
 Non-controlling interests are comprised of the Company s joint venture partners interests in the joint ventures in real estate properties that the Company consolidates. The Company reports its joint venture partners interests in its consolidated real estate joint ventures and other subsidiary interests held by third-parties as non-controlling interests. The Company records these non-controlling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investments net income or loss and equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are generally allocated pro rata based on the respective ownership percentages until the venture reaches certain performance measures, at which time the other venture party will be entitled to preferred distributions (profit interests). 
 r. Income Taxes 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Company believes it operates in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company 
 14 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its taxable income. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including, among others, a requirement that it currently distributes at least 90 of its taxable income to stockholders, subject to certain adjustments. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year without the benefit of certain relief provisions, it will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state or local taxes on its income, property or net worth and federal taxes and excise taxes on its undistributed income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS will be fully subject to federal, state and local income taxes. 
 The Company accounts for TRS income taxes under the liability method as required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the GAAP basis and tax basis of the TRS income, assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, several of the Company's subsidiaries were considered taxable corporations for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries are subject to corporate level U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their net taxable income. 
 ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the combined consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits. Management s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We file tax returns for U.S. federal, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitation is open for all jurisdictions for tax years beginning in 2018. 
 The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties on tax positions, if any, as expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no interest and penalties have been accrued. 
 s. Concentration of Counterparty Risk and Credit Risk 
 In the normal course of its business, the Company encounters counterparty risk and credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, principal and interest outstanding on unsecured consumer loans, and amounts deposited with each of the Company's Lending Platforms. Counterparty risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us. 
 t. Servicing, Collection and Upfront Fees 
 The Company incurs a monthly servicing fee for each outstanding unsecured consumer loan, which is payable to the Lending Platforms for managing payments from borrowers and maintaining loan account portfolios. The Company incurs collection fees on amounts recovered from delinquent loans, which is payable to the Lending Platforms. The Company incurs an upfront fee on unsecured consumer loans purchased from Avant. All servicing, collection and upfront fees are expensed as incurred. 
 u. Collateralized Loan Obligations CLOs 
 The Company holds investments in CLOs which are subordinated debt interests in syndicated loans managed by third-party collateral managers with industry experience. The outstanding investments range in expected maturity from April 2026 to October 2033 and pays interest based on the three-month LIBOR 3ML plus 5.20 to 9.23 . 
 Secondary CLOs purchased from a broker are recorded on the trade date and are recorded as the settlement value of cash, plus purchased accrued interest. Purchased accrued interest is treated as a return of capital upon receipt within the first two quarterly payment cycles. The discount to par is amortized over the expected maturity of the CLO debt, which is calculated using estimated cash flows on the date of purchase. 
 Primary CLOs purchased either from the collateral manager or the broker are recorded on the settled date, to reflect the potential changes, updates or resizing of the position, due to the long-term nature of settlement. The typical settlement time for Depository Trust Company bonds is three days. Amortization of an original issue 
 15 

National Property REIT Corp 
 Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements 

 discount is calculated to expected maturity date, based on projected cash flows at the time of purchase, and recorded over the expected life of the bond. 
 Gains or losses from the sale or call of CLOs are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale or call. Restructured or permanently impaired CLOs are recorded in the period of measurement and recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations as a realized gain or loss and amortized to expected maturity based on the available cash flows at the time of measurement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 v. Corporate bonds 
 The Company holds corporate bonds comprised of investment grade and high yield corporate bonds including performing credit strategies focused on income-oriented, senior loan and bond investment strategies targeting U.S. issuers. 
 Secondary corporate bonds purchased from a broker are recorded on a trade date basis and are recorded as the settlement value of cash, plus purchased accrued interest. Purchased accrued interest is treated as a return of capital upon receipt of coupon. The discount to par is amortized over the stated maturity of the corporate bond and recognized as part of interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. The typical settlement time for Depository Trust Company bonds is three days. Gains or losses from the sale or call of Corporate Bonds are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale or call. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 w. Interest rate caps 
 In order to manage the risks associated with the variable rate financing of the mortgage, the Company may enter into various interest rate cap agreements. The cap agreements have initial notional values equal to the original loan amount of the related mortgages. 
 Derivative instruments not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets with any change in fair value reflected in the combined consolidated statement of operations in the period of change. The fair value of the interest rate caps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 25,724,128 and 3,311,090, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was 14,067,690 and 0, respectively, of gain recorded for the fair value of the interest rate caps. 
 x. Reclassifications 
 Certain amounts in the 2021 combined consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2022 presentation. 
 y. Recent accounting pronouncements 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, an update to ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period rather than recognizing the credit losses when it is probable that the loss has been incurred in accordance with current GAAP. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, which clarified that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of ASC Topic 326, and instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for under the scope of ASC Topic 842, Leases. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which provides transition relief for entities adopting ASU 2016-13 by allowing entities to elect the fair value option on certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022. This adoption did not have a material impact on the combined consolidated financial statements.

 10. Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 The CLO investments held by NGL are subordinated debt interests in broadly syndicated loans managed by established collateral management teams with many years of experience in the industry. 
 The credit risk of a CLO is dependent on the underlying assets within the portfolio. For traditional CLOs, the collateral pool primarily consists of first lien, senior secured broadly syndicated bank loans (usually at least 90 of the total portfolio), and it may include a predetermined allowable portion of other asset types such as second lien bank loans (which are highly leveraged) and unsecured debt, as well as middle market loans. 
 Some CLOs consist predominantly of middle market loans as the underlying collateral. The average rating of the underlying collateral is typically single-B, and the leveraged bank loans are typically floating rate, based on LIBOR.

 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that financial instrument is transacted. 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. 
 Most of our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis were classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, NGL s CLO portfolio totaling 237,125,053 was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 at January 1, 2022 due to the volatility of the observable inputs, which were caused primarily by rising interest rates. The net change in unrealized (losses) gains on the investments that use Level 3 inputs was 1,276,630 as of December 31, 2022. 
 Other than as previously discussed, we did not transfer any assets or liabilities in or out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Transfers between levels, should they occur, will be recognized at the beginning of the quarter during which the asset or liability was transferred. 
 Unsecured Consumer Loans, Residual Interests in Securitizations, and Repurchase Agreements 
 The unsecured consumer loans, residual interests in securitizations, repurchase agreements, and collateralized loan obligations do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. For the unsecured consumer loans and residual interests in securitizations, fair value is estimated by using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon significant unobservable inputs, such as loss adjusted discount rates and projected loss rates. The loss adjusted discount rates are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying unsecured consumer loans, which includes both future principal and interest payments. The projected loss rates are based on the perceived credit risk inherent in each Rating of the unsecured loan portfolio. See Note 9 for details of the unsecured consumer loans. 
 Repurchase agreements are collateralized with the security portfolio. As the carrying value of the repurchase agreement approximates fair value, there were no unobservable inputs that have been internally developed by the Company as of December 31, 2022. 
 NGL qualifies as an investment company pursuant to ASC Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies . Accordingly, the underlying CLO investments and repurchase agreements are carried at fair value and were retained in consolidation by the Company.

 In determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, management utilizes an independent valuation firm that uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model. 
 The interests we have acquired in CLOs are generally thinly traded or have only a limited trading market. CLOs are typically privately offered and sold, even in the secondary market. As a result, investments in CLOs may be characterized as illiquid securities. In addition to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, CLO residual interests carry additional risks, including, but not limited to (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default (iii) our investments in CLO tranches will likely be subordinate to other senior classes of note tranches thereof and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the CLO investment or unexpected investment results. Our net asset value may also decline over time if our principal recovery with respect to CLO residual interests is less than the cost of those investments. Our CLO investments and or the CLOs underlying senior secured loans may prepay more quickly than expected, which could have an adverse impact on our value. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Corporate Bonds and Interest Rate Caps 
 Secondary corporate bonds purchased from a broker are recorded on a trade date basis and are recorded as the settlement value of cash, plus purchased accrued interest. Purchased accrued interest is treated as a return of capital upon receipt of coupon. The discount to par is amortized over the stated maturity of the corporate bond and recognized as part of interest income on the combined consolidated statements of operations. The typical settlement time for Depository Trust Company bonds is three days. Gains or losses from the sale or call of Corporate Bonds are recorded as a realized gain or loss on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on the date of sale or call. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded on the combined consolidated statements of operations and recognized on each valuation date. 
 On a recurring basis, the Company measures its interest rate cap at its estimated fair value. In determining the fair value of the Company's derivative, the Company uses the present value of expected cash flows based on market observable interest rate yield curve commensurate with the term of the instrument. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and that of the respective counterparty in the fair value measurement. The credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by either the respective counterparty or the Company. However, the Company determined that as of December 31, 2022, the impact of the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the derivatives. As a result, the fair value of the derivative is considered to be based primarily on Level 2 inputs.
