Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and the rules of the SEC and should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024. 

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures
contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, as reported in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K have been omitted. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses in the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various
other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from its estimates. To the extent there are material
differences between estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the valuation of intangible assets, including goodwill, and gain (losses) on dispositions. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities approximate their
fair value because of their short-term maturity.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment
Disclosures . The new guidance requires enhanced disclosure of significant expenses that are regularly reported to the chief
operating decision maker and the nature of segment expense information used to manage operations. The new guidance is effective for
all public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the new standard in annual reporting period
beginning after December 15, 2023 and is currently evaluating the impacts of the new guidance on its disclosure within the financial
statements. The Company does not expect any significant impact from the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) : Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The new guidance
requires disaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and additional information on taxes paid that meet a quantitative
threshold. The new guidance is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and for
non-public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted for both. The Company
will adopt the new standard in annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2025, and is currently evaluating the impacts of
the new guidance on its disclosures within the consolidated financial statements. 

Accounts
Receivable, net 

On
January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments and its related amendments using the prospective method. The new standard requires the use of a current
expected credit loss impairment model to develop and recognize credit losses for financial instruments at amortized cost when the asset
is first originated or acquired, and each subsequent reporting period. 

The
Company s receivables are from customers and are typically collected within 90 days. The Company determines the allowance based
on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 

Other
Receivables 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other receivables are and . As of September 30, 2024, other receivables
primarily consist of short-term advances to Wellgistics Health, Inc. (f/k/a Danam Health Inc.). 

Deferred
Offering Costs 

The
Company complies with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 340-10-S99-1 with regards to offering costs. Prior to the
completion of an offering, offering costs are capitalized. The deferred offering costs are charged to additional paid-in capital or
as a discount to debt, as applicable, upon the completion of an offering or to expense if the offering is not completed. As of
September 30, 2024, the Company has 
capitalized deferred offering costs. 

Acquisitions 

The
Company accounts for acquisitions and investments in businesses as business combinations if the target meets the definition of a business
and (a) the target is a variable interest entity VIE and the Company is the target s primary beneficiary, and therefore
the Company must consolidate its financial statements, or (b) the Company acquires more than 50 of the voting interest of the target
and it was not previously consolidated. The Company records business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires
all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 

The
application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions
in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration
between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including
valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited
to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost
savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. 

If
the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the Company s financial
statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill. 

If
the Company s investment involves the acquisition of an asset or group of assets that does not meet the definition of a business,
the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at cost, which includes capitalizing transaction
costs, and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. 

On
July 25, 2024, the Company acquired intangible assets of and recognized goodwill of pursuant to the Scienture
acquisition (see Note 3). The acquired goodwill represents the value in excess of the net assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition
date. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no indicators of impairment since the acquisition in July 2024. Company determined that no
impairment was necessary. 

Intangible
Assets and Goodwill 

The
Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes occur that would more-likely-than
not reduce the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value between annual impairment tests. Any indefinite-lived
intangible asset assessment is performed at the Company level. 

The
Company did not record an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. 

Investments 

The
Company accounts for investments that it does not control using the cost method, equity method or fair value method, as applicable. Investments
in companies in which the Company owns less than a 20 equity interest and where it does not exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically reviews
the carrying value of these investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below carrying value.
A variety of factors are considered when determining if a decline in fair value below carrying value is other-than-temporary, including,
among others, the financial condition and business prospects of the investee, as well as the Company s investment intent. Cost
method investments are carried at cost, which approximates or is less than fair value. Dividends received by the Company are recognized
in equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations. 

On
February 29, 2024, Softell entered into a Subscription Agreement (the Subscription Agreement with Lafayette Energy
Corp., a Delaware corporation Lafayette ). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, Softell agreed, in two equal
tranches, to invest a total of up to 
in Lafayette in exchange for up to 
shares of Lafayette s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with the second tranche becoming payable only upon Softell s
receipt of notice that Lafayette has successfully drilled its first oil and gas well and produced at least one hundred (100) barrels
of oil. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s investment in Lafayette was . The Company determined there was impairment necessary
as of September 30, 2024. 

Research
 Development Expenses 

Research
and development costs are expensed in the period incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. These expenses
consist of independent contractor costs, costs for outsourced analytical research and development activities, batch manufacturing
cost and, advisory costs as a part of research, market research costs and other regulatory consulting costs. 

Income
(loss) Per Common Share 

Basic
net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share is computed similar to basic net income per common share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been
issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The dilutive effect of the Company s options and warrants is computed
using the treasury stock method. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock, 
shares of Series B preferred stock and options to purchase shares of common stock.

The
Company s provision for income taxes was 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The income tax provisions
for these periods are based upon estimates of annual income (loss), annual permanent differences and statutory tax rates in
the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. For all periods presented, the Company utilized net operating loss carryforwards
to offset the impact of any taxable income. The Company s tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates due primarily to
the establishment of a valuation allowance, utilization of deferred and the effect of permanent differences and adjustments.

We
will need to raise additional capital or secure debt funding to support on-going operations, and to fund the assets and operations of
any businesses or assets we acquire. The sources of this capital are expected to be the sale of equity and debt, which may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all, and may, if sold, cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. If we are unable to access additional
capital moving forward, it may hurt our ability to grow and to generate future revenues, our financial position, and liquidity. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless management is able to obtain
additional financing, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to meet its funding requirements during the next 12 months. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Other Measures of Income ASC 470 ), which relates to cash received from a funding source in exchange for a specified percentage
or amount of revenue or other measure of income of a particular product line, business segment, trademark, patent or contractual right
for a defined period. Under this guidance, the Company recognized the fair value of its contingent obligation to the funding source,
as of the acquisition date, as a current liability in its consolidated balance sheet. 

Under
ASC 470, amounts recorded as debt are to be amortized under the interest method. The Company made an accounting policy election to utilize
the prospective method when there is a change in the estimated future cash flows, whereby a new effective interest rate is determined
based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The new rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the revised
estimate of remaining cash flows with the carrying amount of the debt, and it will be used to recognize interest expense for the remaining
period. Under this method, the effective interest rate is not constant, and any change in expected cash flows is recognized prospectively
as an adjustment to the effective yield. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the total contingent funding liability was
 and respectively, and the effective interest rate was approximately and , respectively. This rate represents the
discount rate that equates the estimated future cash flows with the fair value of the debt and is used to compute the amount of interest

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash 

Cash
was 579,103 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 314 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash was primarily due to the proceeds
in February 2024 and May 2024 related to the disposition of certain assets to MMS as described above. We expect that our
future available capital resources will consist primarily of cash generated from operations, remaining cash balances, borrowings, and
additional funds raised through sales of debt and/or equity securities. 

Liquidity 

Cash,
current assets, current liabilities, short term debt and working capital at the end of each period were as follows:

Our
principal sources of liquidity have historically been cash provided by operations, sales of business assets and operations from time
to time, sales of equity, and borrowings under various debt arrangements. Our principal uses of cash have been for operating expenses,
technology development, and acquisitions. We anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal sources of, and uses of, cash in
the future.

 Table of Contents 

The
increase in cash as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the proceeds received in February 2024
and May 2024 resulting from the disposition of assets to MMS as described above. 

Special
Cash Dividend 

On
March 6, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a special cash dividend of eight dollars 8.00) per share of common stock, payable
to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024, with the dividend being paid on March 22, 2024. The special dividend of 12,671,072 was
paid using a portion of the proceeds from the closing of the sale of certain assets. 

On
July 9, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a special cash dividend of one dollar and fifty cents 1.50) per share of common
stock, payable to stockholders of record as of July 19, 2024, with the dividend being paid on July 22, 2024. The special dividend was
 2,187,759 paid using a portion of the proceeds received in May 2024 in connection with the February 2024 sale of certain assets. 

Liquidity
Outlook Cash Explanation 

Cash
Requirements 

Our
primary objectives for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be the continued implementation of Scienture s business plan, marketing
the IPS business, and to complete potential strategic transactions of our business-to-consumer subsidiaries, which may include a
potential sale, spin-off, fund raising, combination or other strategic transaction, and also include the winding down of such
entities. There can be no assurance that our operations will generate significant positive cash flow, or that additional funds will
be available to us, through borrowings or otherwise, on favorable terms if required in the future, or at all. We may also raise
additional funding in the future through the sale of equity. 

We
estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be approximately as follows: 

Projected Expenses from October 2024 to September 2025 
 Amount 
 
 General and administrative (1) 
 9,800,000 
 
 Total 
 9,800,000 

(1)
Includes estimated wages and payroll, legal and accounting, marketing, rent and web development. 

We
may require additional funding in the future to implement on our business plan and potentially to expand or complete acquisitions.
The sources of this capital are expected to be equity investments and notes payable. Our plan for the next twelve months is to
integrate Scienture and its research and development activities, continue using the same marketing and management strategies to
promote our IPS assets and operations, exploring strategic transactions involving our corporate assets, while also seeking to expand
our operations organically or through acquisitions, as funding and opportunities arise. In the event we require
additional funding, we plan to raise that through the sale of debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at
all, and may, if sold, cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. If we are unable to access additional capital moving
forward, it may hurt our ability to grow and to generate future revenues. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year after the
date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), our management evaluates whether
there are conditions or events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 31,876,241. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 579,103 in cash. 

We
will need to raise additional capital or secure debt funding to support on-going operations, and to fund the assets and operations of
any businesses or assets we acquire. The sources of this capital are expected to be the sale of equity and debt, which may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all, and may, if sold, cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. If we are unable to access additional
capital moving forward, it may hurt our ability to grow and to generate future revenues, our financial position, and liquidity. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless Management is able to obtain
additional financing, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to meet its funding requirements during the next 12 months. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

ended September 30, 2023, of 1,206,077. The increase in cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared

activities was 74,283 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities in the

There
were 64,861 in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues decreased by 327,425, compared to the same period ended
September 30, 2023 primarily because of the disposition of the assets and operations of Softell completed in February 2024 which
resulted in the Company having fewer revenue generating operations when compared to the comparable period in 2023. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, cost of goods sold and gross (loss) profit were 60,978 and 3,883, and 352,694 and
 39,592, all respectively for the same period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 5.99 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 10.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Wages
and salary expense increased by 701,635 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 708,977 compared to 7,342 for the comparable
period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in salary of the COO and CEO of IPS, as well as the
Scienture Merger in July 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Professional
fees increased by 297,867 to 593,364 compared to 295,497 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increase
in board members fees and consulting expense and post-acquisition professional fees expense of Scienture. 

Accounting
and legal expenses increased by 209,747 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 619,227 compared to 409,480 for the
comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased legal services during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

General
and administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation expense) increased by 101,769 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, to 168,649 compared to 66,880 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to increase in headcount in
connection with our acquisition of Scienture s operations in July 2024. 

Technology
expense increased 135,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 157,474 compared to 22,071 for the comparable period in
2023. The increase was mainly due to increased software expense and software support expense. 

Research
and development expense increased 1,253,983 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,253,983 compared to 0 for the comparable
period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to contract research organization costs of Scienture upon the merger in July 2024. 

We
had interest expense of 217,433 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 251,778 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the sale of note payable of Superlatus subsequent to the sale of the Company s equity interest in Superlatus
to Superlatus Foods, Inc. thereby transferring all assets and liabilities, and partially offset by interest expense of 43,200 deemed
incurred in full on the date of issue of convertible note of 360,000 and amortization of debt discount. 

We
recognized a gain on the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 502,178 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to a gain of 925,320 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, based on the underlying valuation inputs. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of 2,783,601 compared to a net
loss from continuing operations of 88,136 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss is mainly driven by
the integration of Scienture upon its merger in July 2024. 

Net
loss from discontinued operations was 3,436,978 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

There
were 83,560 in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues decreased by 1,151,608, compared to the same period ended
September 30, 2023 primarily because of the disposition of the assets and operations of Softell completed in February 2024 which resulted in the
Company having fewer revenue generating operations when compared to the comparable period in 2023. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, cost of goods sold and gross (loss) profit were 80,380 and 3,180, and 1,072,178 and
 162,990, all respectively for the same period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 3.81 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 13.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Wages
and salary expense increased by 898,386 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,243,621 compared to 345,235 for the comparable
period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in salary of the COO and CEO of IPS, as well as the Scienture
Merger in July 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Professional
fees increased by 662,259 to 1,282,053 compared to 619,794 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increase
in Board members fees and consulting expense and post acquisition professional fees of Scienture. 

Accounting
and legal expenses increased by 347,487 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,129,982 compared to 782,495 for the comparable
period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased legal services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to the same period in 2023. 

General
and administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation expense) increased by 4,800,857 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, to 5,284,231 compared to 483,374 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to shares issued for services
at fair value of 4,450,919. 

Technology
expense increased by 220,817 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 295,763 compared to 74,946 for the comparable period
in 2023. The increase was mainly due to increased software expense and software support expense. 

Research
and development expense increased 1,253,983 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 1,253,983 compared to 0 for the comparable
period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to contract research organization costs of Scienture upon the merger in July 2024. 

We
had interest expense of 320,897 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 494,904 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the sale of note payable of Superlatus subsequent to the sale of the Company s equity interest in Superlatus
to Superlatus Foods, Inc. thereby transferring all assets and liabilities, and partially offset by interest expense of 43,200 deemed
incurred in full on the date of issue of convertible note of 360,000 and amortization of debt discount. 

We
recognized a loss on the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 392,843 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to a loss of 443,308 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on the underlying valuation inputs. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of 11,041,764 compared to a net
loss from continuing operations of 3,429,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss is mainly driven
by stock compensation in 2024, as well as the integration of Scienture upon its merger in July 2024. 

Net
income from discontinued operations increased by 30,419,127 to a net income of 27,670,294 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of 2,748,833 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily
due to the disposal of Softell assets, partially offset by loss on disposal of Superlatus during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each
period. The following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are the most
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult, subjective
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Revenue
Recognition 

In
general, the Company accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

IPS is a licensed wholesaler of brand, generic and non-drug products to
Customers. IPS takes orders for products, creates invoices for each order and recognizes revenue at the time the Customer receives the
product. Customer returns are not material. Step One: Identify the contract with the Customer IPS requires that an application
and a credit card for payment be completed by the Customer prior to the first order. Each transaction is evidenced by an order form sent
by the Customer and an invoice for the product is sent by IPS. The collection is probable based on the application and credit card information
provided prior to the first order. Step Two: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Each order is distinct and evidenced
by the shipping order and invoice. Step Three: Determine the transaction price The consideration is variable if product is returned.
The variability is determined based on the return policy of the product manufacturer. There are no sales or volume discounts. The transaction
price is determined at the time of the order evidenced by the invoice. Step Four: Allocate the transaction price There is no difference
between contract price and stand-alone selling price . Step Five: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance
obligation The Revenue is recognized when the Customer receives the product.

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation .
ASC 718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including
stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock option forfeitures are recognized at the
date of employee termination. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07 for the accounting of share-based payments granted
to non-employees for goods and services.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, as appropriate, in order to allow timely decisions in connection with
required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our
principal executive officer and principal accounting/financial officer), as of September 30,
2024, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with
the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or
by the collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In
the ordinary course of business, we may become a party to lawsuits involving various matters. The impact and outcome of litigation, if
any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Such
current litigation or other legal proceedings are described in, and incorporated by reference in, this ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from, PART I ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in NOTE 16 CONTINGENCIES . The Company believes that the resolution of currently pending matters will
not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, assessment
of the current litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to the Company or
by judges, juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome
of such litigation or claims. 

Additionally,
the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period
for amounts in excess of management s expectations, the Company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting
period could be materially adversely affected. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 22, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), in each case under the
heading Risk Factors , except for the risks inherent in the assets and operations of Scienture that pertain to the Company
after the completion of the merger transaction completed in July 2024 and as set forth below, and investors should review the risks provided
in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and below, prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating
results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those
described in the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q and below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s
actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating
results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition,
operating results and stock price. 

The
Company s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience
in connection with the merger. 

The
Company and Scienture completed a merger transaction on July 25, 2024 as generally described in this report (and other reports and filings
we have filed with the SEC), and, if the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated
from the merger, the Company s stockholders will have experienced dilution of their ownership interests in the Company without
receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to
realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger.
