Overview 

Since the acquisition of Global Stem Cell Group
(GSCG) in August of 2021, our focus has been mainly dedicated to its operations serving the markets in the regenerative medicine industry.
We believe stem cell therapy is becoming an increasingly effective clinical solution for treating conditions that traditional or conventional
medicine only offers within palliative care and pain management. Patients around the world are seeking a natural regenerative alternative
without the potential risks and side effects sometimes associated with conventional pharmaceuticals. 

We work with doctors and their staff to provide
products, solutions, equipment, services, and training to help them be successful in the application of Stem Cell Therapies. We also engage
in patient procedures from treatments that GSCG is offering at its Cancun, Mexico clinic, with another clinic soon expected in a joint
venture with an investor under renovation in Dubai, UAE. This new clinic is scheduled to open on November 23, 2024, and will be located
at the Hyatt Hotel in Jumeirah, a coastal residential area of Dubai UAE. 

Our team combines solutions from extensive clinical
research with the manufacturing and commercialization of viable cell therapy and immune support related products that we believe will
change the course of traditional medicine around the world forever. Our strategy allows us the ability to create immediate revenue streams
through treatments, product sales, distribution, and clinical applications, driven by our extensive education platform. Our revenue comes
directly from treating patents, our training and the seminars, from the resale of kits, products, equipment, services, and from the reoccurring
application of our process using the kits and solutions we provide. 

Global Stem Cells Group is a leader in the Stem
Cell and Regenerative Medicine fields, covering clinical research, patient applications, along with physician training through our state-of-the-art
global network of companies. Its mission is to enable physicians to make the benefits of stem cell medicine a reality for patients around
the world. GSCG has been educating doctors on the science and application of cell-based therapeutics for the past 10 years. Our professional
trademarked association ISCCA INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR STEM CELL APPLICATION is a global network of medical professionals
that leverages these multinational relationships to build best practices and further our mission. 

GSCG envisions the ability to improve health-span 
through the discovery and developments of new cellular therapy products, and cutting-edge technology. 

GSCG, as almost everyone else in the world, was
severely affected by the covid 19 pandemic. As we have been recovering in 2022 and into 2023, we are integrating every aspect of the regenerative
medicine industry. During 2024, we plan to continue to add manufacturing and commercialization of viable cell therapy and immune support
related products that we believe will change the course of traditional medicine around the world forever. 

We believe this strategy will allow us the ability
to increase our current revenues and create immediate revenue streams through product sales, distribution, and clinical applications,
driven by our extensive education platform here are our main projects and revenue generators for 2024 and beyond.

Revenue 

Revenue increased by
52.48 in the amount of 339,480 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue
was a result of marketing and sales efforts to increase brand recognition and exposure in the industry. We experienced more lead generation
in 2023 increasing equipment, products, and training sales in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The opening of the
Cancun facility in the second half of 2022 also increased sales by providing a facility for physicians to come for training and perform
patient procedures. 

We expect that our revenues
will increase in future quarters as a result of our ongoing marketing and brand awareness campaigns, training seminars, lectures and other
efforts we engage in that expand our presence in the industry and provide us more opportunities to sell our products. We also expect revenues
to increase with the opening of our new clinic in Dubai, UAE, scheduled to occur on November 23, 2024. This clinic, alongside our existing
clinic in Cancun, will also provide a facility for physicians to come for training and perform patient procedures. 

We have also added new
regenerative products that are expected to further increase revenue. In August 2024, we introduced our new line of innovative Cellgenic
peptides. This new product line is expected to play a crucial role in the field of regenerative medicine. Our Cellgenic peptides have
the potential to address the following health concerns: healing and recovery from injuries, enhancing muscle recovery and reducing inflammation,
enhancing tanning and improving sexual function, improving body composition and metabolic health, managing weight loss and diabetes, among
other potential health potential benefits.

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses increased by 38.46 in the
amount of 202,056 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Listed below are the major changes
to operating expenses: 

Advertising and marketing fees increased by 1,207
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in advertising by Global
Stem Cells Group. 

Professional fees increased by 92,542 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to expansion of the Cancun facility. 

Depreciation and amortization decreased by 9,839
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 

Investor relations increased by 1,153 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 

25 

General and administrative expenses increased
by 116,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in travel
and office expense by Global Stem Cells Group. 

We expect our overall operating expenses to increase
on a quarterly basis for the balance of the year and into 2024 as we further implement our business plan. We expect increases in future
quarters over all major categories as we engage in efforts to increase brand awareness with our products and services, including advertising
campaigns and investor relation services. We also expect an increase in general operating costs and growth initiatives as we ramp up operations
and seek to expand them. The opening of a new clinic on November 23, 2024 in Dubai, UAE will also increase our operating expenses with
a new lease of property, staff, equipment and other expenses associated with this growth initiative. 

Other expenses 

Other expenses decreased by 4,875,302 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of impairment of goodwill of 4,125,460
in 2023 and decrease of 752,028 of interest on promissory notes. 

We had interest expense of 903,572 and 1,657,600
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We expect to continue to experience high interest
payments in the future as a result of our outstanding liabilities. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional
financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders will call the notes and we will be unable to repay the loans. If this happens,
we could go out of business. 

Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 887,146 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with a net loss of 5,857,159 for the same period in 2023. 

Below is a summary of the results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Revenue 

Revenue increased by
44.71 in the amount of 802,286 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue
was a result of marketing and sales efforts to increase brand recognition and exposure in the industry. We experienced more lead generation
in 2023 increasing equipment, products, and training sales in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The opening of the
Cancun facility in the second half of 2022 also increased sales by providing a facility for physicians to come for training and perform
patient procedures. 

We expect that our revenues
will increase in future quarters as a result of our ongoing marketing and brand awareness campaigns, training seminars, lectures and other
efforts we engage in that expand our presence in the industry and provide us more opportunities to sell our products. We also expect revenues
to increase with the opening of our new clinic in Dubai, UAE, scheduled to occur on November 23, 2024. This clinic, alongside our existing
clinic in Cancun, will also provide a facility for physicians to come for training and perform patient procedures. 

We have also added new
regenerative products that are expected to further increase revenue. In August 2024, we introduced our new line of innovative Cellgenic
peptides. This new product line is expected to play a crucial role in the field of regenerative medicine. Our Cellgenic peptides have
the potential to address the following health concerns: healing and recovery from injuries, enhancing muscle recovery and reducing inflammation,
enhancing tanning and improving sexual function, improving body composition and metabolic health, managing weight loss and diabetes, among
other potential health potential benefits.

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses increased by 17.65 in the
amount of 321,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Listed below are the major changes
to operating expenses: 

Advertising and marketing fees decreased by 13,783
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in advertising by Global
Stem Cells Group. 

Professional fees increased by 129,149 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to expansion of the Cancun facility. 

Depreciation and amortization increased by 35,201
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to expansion of the Cancun facility. 

Investor relations increased by 43,095 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an agreement with an investor relation firm
in February 2024. 

General and administrative expense increased by
 127,678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in travel and
office expense by Global Stem Cells Group. 

We expect our overall operating expenses to increase
on a quarterly basis for the balance of the year and into 2024 as we further implement our business plan. We expect increases in future
quarters over all major categories as we engage in efforts to increase brand awareness with our products and services, including advertising
campaigns and investor relation services. We also expect an increase in general operating costs and growth initiatives as we ramp up operations
and seek to expand them. The opening of a new clinic on November 23, 2024 in Dubai, UAE will also increase our operating expenses with
a new lease of property, staff, equipment and other expenses associated with this growth initiative. 

27 

Other expense 

Other expense decreased by 4,352,166 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of impairment of goodwill of 4,125,460
in 2023, and the decrease of 236,486 of interest on promissory notes. 

We had interest expense of 4,621,920 and 4,858,406
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We expect to continue to experience high interest
payments in the future as a result of our outstanding liabilities. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional
financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders will call the notes and we will be unable to repay the loans. If this happens,
we could go out of business. 

Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 4,924,786 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with a net loss of 9,557,629 for the same period in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since inception, we have financed our operations
through private placements, convertible notes, and unsecured and secured debt. 

The following is a summary of the cash and cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Operating activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 471,306 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 3,021,999
and non-cash items of 2,374,092, and offset mainly by our net loss of 4,924,786. The non-cash items for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, consisted of depreciation and amortization expenses of 248,371, amortization of debt discount of 2,122,293, and change in
derivative liabilities of 3,428. The significant change in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, partially offset by the decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expense. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 389,800
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of a net loss of 9,557,629, which was offset by a net change in operating
assets and liabilities of 2,539,793 and non-cash items of 6,628,036. The non-cash items for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
consisted of impairment of goodwill of 4,125,460, depreciation and amortization expenses of 213,170 and amortization of debt discount
of 2,295,758, partially offset by the change in derivative liabilities of 3,889 and gain on settlement of debt of 2,463. The significant
change in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by the decrease
in accounts receivable and prepaid expense.

Investing activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 165,419
and consisted of the purchase of property and equipment associated with the expansion of the Cancun facility during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 101,594
and consisted of the purchase of property and equipment associated with the Cancun facility during the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Financing activities 

We had no financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities was 9,850 and consisted of principal payment of debt for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Since our
inception, we have financed our operations through private placements, convertible notes, and unsecured debt, and we have also issued
debt in our company secured by all of our assets. We expect to continue to experience high interest payments in the future as a result
of our outstanding liabilities. Additionally, as of the date of this report, there are a number of secured promissory notes
with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 14,472797 that have matured and are in default. Finally, we also have a number of
unsecured promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of 2,859,453 that have matured and are currently in default. The company
is currently in debt restructuring talks, and there are also other lenders as well who have demonstrated interest in assuming this debt.
However, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders
will call the notes, secure our assets, as to those applicable secured notes, and demand payment. If after all these recourses are
exhausted and the debt becomes unresolvable, like any other company, there s a risk we could go out of business. 

At September
30, 2024, we had limited cash of 836,427, a substantial working capital deficit, and although our revenues have increased, future losses
are anticipated. Based upon the current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level
for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which
may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering
to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able
to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired and we could go out of business. There can be no
assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses since inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of
approximately 66,914,916 and a working capital deficit of 26,577,484 as of September 30, 2024 and future losses are anticipated. These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue its operations
as a going concern is dependent on management s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with
some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations
are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. 

The Company will require additional funding to
finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well to achieve its strategic objectives. There can be no assurance
that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification
of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

29 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our critical accounting policies have not materially
changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Furthermore, the preparation of our financial statements is in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires
management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Our management
believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates, and the financial statements fairly represent all periods presented.
However, any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statements of income
and financial position. 

Derivative Instruments 

The derivative instruments are accounted for as
liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair market value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with
changes in fair value recognized in operations for each reporting period. The Company uses the Monte Carlo option pricing model to value
the derivative instruments. 

Stock Based Compensation 

Share-based compensation issued to employees is
measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The
Company measures the fair value of the share-based compensation issued to non-employees at the grant date using the stock price observed
in the trading market (for stock transactions) or the fair value of the award (for non-stock transactions), which were considered to be
more reliably determinable measures of fair value than the value of the services being rendered. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No.
2020 - 04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . ASU
 2020 - 04 provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about
structural risks of interbank offered rates and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ),
regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference
rates that are more observable or transaction-based and less susceptible to manipulation. The ASU provides companies with optional guidance
to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued.
In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021 - 01, Reference Rate Reform Scope , which clarified the scope
and application of the original guidance. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022 - 06, Reference Rate Reform Deferral
of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 . This update extends the sunset provision of ASU 2020 - 04 to December 31, 2024. The
Company has not yet adopted this ASU and is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016 - 13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .
ASU 2016 - 13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and
requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For companies that
qualified as Smaller Reporting Companies as defined by the SEC as of November 19, 2019, ASU 2016 - 13 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating
the impact of the guidance on its financial statements. 

Other accounting standards and amendments to existing
accounting standards that have been issued and have future effective dates are not applicable or are not expected to have a significant
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

30 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of fair value over
identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, instead goodwill is reviewed
for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with FASB
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , we determine revenue recognition through the following steps: 

(1) Identify
the contract with a customer 

(2) Identify
the performance obligations in the contract 

(3) Determine
the transaction price 

(4) Allocate
the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract 

(5) Recognize
revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied 

The Company s main source of revenue is
comprised of the following: 

Training -GSCG
offers a Stem Cell Exosomes Certification Program where physicians attending these training sessions will take advantage of a full
review of stem cell biology, characterization and regenerative properties of cells and cell products, cytokines and growth factors and
how they can be applied in a clinic setting. The physicians will pay for the training sessions upfront and receive all the material and
certificate upon completion of seminar. Completion of the seminar is when control is transferred and when revenue is recognized. 

Products -Physicians
can order SVF Kits through GSCG which includes EC Certificate from Institute for Testing and Certificating, Inc. SVT Kits are paid for
upfront and shipped from a third party directly to physicians. Transfer of control is when the product is shipped which is when revenue
is recognized. 

Equipment - Physicians can order equipment through GSCG which includes a warranty from the manufacturer of equipment. Equipment is paid for upfront and shipped from the manufacturer directly to physicians. Transfer of control is when the equipment is shipped which is when revenue is recognized. 

Patient Procedures - Patient procedures are the treatments GSCG is offering at its Cancun clinic and its clinic in Dubai, UAE, scheduled to open on November 23, 2024. The transfer of control is when the procedures are completed which is when revenue is recognized. 

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies
a performance obligation by transferring control over a product to a customer or as services are rendered. Revenue is measured based on
the consideration the Company receives in exchange for those products. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates included
in these financial statements are associated with accounting for the goodwill, derivative liability valuations, valuation of preferred
stock, fair value estimates, valuation of assets and liabilities in business combination and in its going concern analysis. 

31 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The fair value of financial instruments, which
include cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from related parties were estimated to approximate their carrying values
due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed
to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from financial instruments. 

Fair value is defined as the price which would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. A three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, as follows: 

Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment
speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining
the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, account payables, and accrued expenses, approximate their
respective fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
Company does not have any assets or liabilities except for derivative liabilities related to convertible notes payable required to be
measured at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are not required to provide the information
required by this Item because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

32 

As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b),
we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described
below. 

1. We
do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over
financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our
assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material
weakness. 

2. We
have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely
basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely
communication between non financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures
and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness. 

3. The
Company failed to account for the acquisition of GSCG using the full purchase accounting method in accordance with ASC 805. 

To address these material weaknesses, management
engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein
fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. We have
not remedied the material weaknesses as of September 30, 2024. The Company plans to take remedial action to address these weaknesses during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting, except the implementation of the controls identified above. 

33 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

To the Company s knowledge, there is no
action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization
or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting
our Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our Company s or our Company s subsidiaries officers or

the SEC on April 15, 2024. The risks described may not be the only risks we face. Other risks of which we are not yet aware, or that we
currently believe are not material, may also materially and adversely impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the
events or circumstances described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report occur, our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be adversely impacted and the value of an investment in our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
Company had insufficient cash on hand to repay these notes. None of these notes have been paid, and management has indicated that no demand
for payment for any of these notes has been received by the Company as of the date of this report. If we are unable to generate sufficient
revenues and/or additional financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders will call the notes, secure our assets, as to those
applicable secured notes, and demand payment. If this happens, we could go out of business.
