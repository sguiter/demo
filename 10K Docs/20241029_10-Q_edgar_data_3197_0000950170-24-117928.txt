The Company completes its goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment assessment annually in the fourth quarter, or more often if circumstances require. As a part of its impairment assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not, defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent, that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value is more likely than not greater than the carrying value, the Company does not quantitatively test for impairment. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated. If the estimated fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reviewed its previous forecasts and assumptions based on its current projections, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. The Company did not identify any triggering events during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 that would require an interim impairment assessment of goodwill or intangible assets.

 Amortization and earnout expense was 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization and earnout expense was 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expense is attributable to an increase of 0.4 million in earnout expense and increases in definite lived asset amortization due to increased intangible assets attributable to current and prior year acquisitions. 
 Operating income decreased 0.7 million to 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with operating income of 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the increased gross profit. 
 Operating income increased 2.2 million to 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with operating income of 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in net sales. 
 Non-GAAP operating income was 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales decreased to 8.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP operating income was 33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 31.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 8.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 25 

Interest expense decreased to 2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with interest expense of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to reduction of the debt balance. 
 Interest expense decreased to 9.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with interest expense of 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to reduction of the debt balance. 
 Income tax expense was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with income tax expense of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense was 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with income tax expense of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 38.7 compared with 13.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.8 compared with 13.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differ from the United States federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate is affected by certain other permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, we received a tax indemnification payment of 0.5 million, related to a prior year acquisition, in the second quarter of 2024.

 Engineered Systems Segment 
 Our Engineered Systems segment orders booked increased 13.2 million, or 12.1 , to 122.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 108.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily driven by power end market bookings at emissions management, partially offset by a decrease in bookings at acoustics technologies. Of the 122.1 million in orders booked during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 4.0 million is attributable to an acquisition that occurred during the preceding twelve month period. 
 Our Engineered Systems segment orders booked were 322.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 309.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in water and wastewater treatment technologies.

The decrease is entirely attributable to the variability in timing of large order bookings. On a trailing twelve-month basis, Engineered Systems revenue has increased 49.8 million, or 
 26 

14.6 . Approximately 94 , or 85.8 million, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to organic revenue. 
 Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased 10.5 million to 278.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 267.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is led by growth in our separation, filtration, and industrial water technologies, partially offset by power end market revenue. Approximately 93 , or 257.9 million, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to organic revenue. 
 Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment is flat at 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased net sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. 
 Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased 11.8 million to 51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 39.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase is wholly driven by an increase in our industrial ducting business. Of the 40.1 million in orders booked during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 0.6 million is attributable to an acquisition that occurred during the preceding twelve month period. 
 Our Industrial Process Solutions segment orders booked decreased 19.4 million, or 13.4 , to 125.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 145.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to two unique industrial air bookings from the first half of 2023 that were not expected to repeat. Of the 125.6 million in orders booked during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0.6 million is attributable to an acquisition that occurred during the preceding twelve month period. 
 Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales were 44.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 43.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Corporate and Other Segment 
 Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased 3.2 million to 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth inclusive of acquisition and integration expenses, and inflationary increases for wages and services. 
 Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased 14.6 million to 48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Backlog 
 Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog increased to 437.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 370.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Our customers may have the right to cancel a given order. Historically, cancellations have not been common. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for adjustments in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by GAAP and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements within Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 When we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self-funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining customer down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub-contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit under our Credit Facility (as defined below). 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 63.1 million, compared with 78.3 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.30 to 1.00 on September 30, 2024, as compared with a ratio of 1.39 to 1.00 on December 31, 2023. The decrease in the ratio was driven by timing of cash receipts and payments to suppliers. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled 38.7 million and 54.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 25.3 million and 38.5 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by certain non-United States subsidiaries, as well as being denominated in foreign currencies.

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 23.0 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with 29.5 million provided by operations in the prior year period, representing 6.5 million decline in cash generated. Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 decreased year-over-year primarily due to timing of costs and billings on uncompleted contracts and payments of prepaid expenses, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 26.2 million compared with 53.6 million used in investing activities in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 26.2 million cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of 15.0 million used for acquisitions as described in Note 15 and 11.2 million for acquisitions of property and equipment. In the prior year period, the 53.6 million cash used in investing activities was the result of 48.1 million used for acquisitions as described in Note 15 and 5.5 million for the acquisition of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 14.5 million was used in financing activities compared with 25.2 million provided by financing activities in the prior year period, for a decrease of 10.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the primary uses of cash for financing activities were 7.8 million to repay long-term debt, 5.0 million to repurchase common stock, 2.1 million of deferred consideration paid for acquisitions, 1.7 million for earnout payments and 1.7 million on distributions to the noncontrolling interest, partially offset by net borrowings on the Company's revolving credit lines of 3.6 million. In the prior year period, the Company used 31.0 million for net borrowings on the Company s revolving credit lines, primarily used to finance acquisitions, 2.5 million in repayment on long-term debt, 1.2 million on deferred payments for acquisitions, and 1.4 million on distributions to the noncontrolling interest. The Company also received 1.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, assumptions used in business combination accounting and related balances, and pension and post-retirement benefits, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
 29 

Management believes there have been no changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than statements of historical fact, including statements about management s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. These statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. We use words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intends, estimate, forecast, project, will, plan, should and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Potential risks and uncertainties, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and include, but are not limited to: 
 the sensitivity of our business to economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in CECO s service areas; 

dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates and method of accounting for revenue; 

the effect of growth on CECO s infrastructure, resources and existing sales; 

the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; 

the potential for contract delay or cancellation as a result of on-going or worsening supply chain challenges; 

liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims; 

changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; 

failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; 

the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials, including as a result of tariffs and surcharges, and rising energy costs; 

inflationary pressures relating to rising raw material costs and the cost of labor; 

the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our strategic transactions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; 

the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; 

our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and the amounts and timing of repurchases; 

our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; 

economic and political conditions generally; 

our ability to optimize our business portfolio by identifying acquisition targets, executing upon any strategic acquisitions or divestitures, integrating acquired businesses and realizing the synergies from strategic transactions; 

unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including cybersecurity threats, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities or public health crises, as well as management s response to any of the aforementioned factors; and 

risks regarding the parties ability to complete the proposed acquisition of Profire in the anticipated timeframe or at all, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement between the parties, the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transaction on business relationships, operating results, and business generally, disruption of current plans and operations and potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the proposed transaction, diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted related to the proposed transaction, the amount of the costs, fees, 

30 

expenses and other charges related to the proposed transaction, the risk that competing offers or acquisition proposals will be made and the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 

Many of these risks are beyond management s ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any related assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. For the Company, these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates. We do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The carrying value of the Company s total long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2024 was 134.3 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease (increase) in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 10 increase (decrease) in the Company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at September 30, 2024. Most of the interest on the Company s debt is indexed to SOFR market rates. The estimated annual impact of a hypothetical 10 change in the estimated weighted average borrowing rate at September 30, 2024 is 1.0 million. 
 The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries in several countries, including in the Netherlands, Canada, the People s Republic of China, Mexico, United Kingdom, Singapore, India, United Arab Emirates and South Korea. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings. Transaction gains (losses) included in Other expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income were 0.3 million and (0.6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.9 million and 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented in this report in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are 
 31 

resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations of its internal controls to enhance, where necessary, its procedures and controls.
