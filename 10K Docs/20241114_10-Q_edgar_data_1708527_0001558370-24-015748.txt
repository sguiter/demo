 million, and the Company may earn up to an additional million, in the aggregate, in the form of earn-out payments. The earn-out payments are equal to of the actual revenue earned by Berkeley in each of the after the closing of the sale from sales of specified Orthobiologics products under the purchase agreement (including improvements, modifications, derivatives and enhancements related to those products). There were earn-out payments earned or paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the purchase agreement provides for a customary indemnity holdback in the amount of million to be retained by Berkeley for after close. In the purchase agreement, the Company has retained the liabilities arising out of the VBM and FiberCel matters, as described in Note 10, both of which products were part of the Orthobiologics Business. The Company recognized a gain of million on the sale of the Orthobiologics Business in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an additional gain of million in the second quarter of 2024 from an adjustment payment related to the final working capital received by Berkeley at the sale date. The indemnity holdback is available as a source of recovery for Berkeley for claims of indemnification under the purchase agreement, and some or all of the holdback may be retained by Berkeley if Berkeley is successful in asserting a claim or claims for indemnification against the Company. The Company is aware of certain indemnity-related claims raised, including a claim from a former supplier alleging breach of contract. Based on the Company s ongoing assessment

 million, the Company does not consider a loss to be probable or estimable as of September 30, 2024. Should the Company receive incremental proceeds in the future through an earn-out payment or payment of the holdback amount, an additional gain will be recorded upon the receipt of such amounts. See Note 4 for further discussion of the sale of the Orthobiologics Business and the presentation of such business as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to continuing operations. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) , the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of million, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used million of cash in operating activities and expects to continue to incur cash outflows during the remainder of 2024. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the Company s commercialization and development efforts, the Company is unable to predict when it will become profitable, and it may never become profitable. The Company s inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, even if the Company does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis, or, in general, be able to satisfy its obligations, including those related to the FiberCel Litigation and VBM Litigation described in Note 10, when they become due. In order to mitigate the current and potential future liquidity issues caused by the matters noted above, we may seek to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or pursue asset sales or other transactions, such as the sale of the Orthobiologics Business described above. However, such transactions may not be successful, and we may not be able to raise additional equity, refinance our debt instruments, or sell assets on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, based on our current operating plans, we believe there is uncertainty as to whether our future cash flows along with our existing cash, issuances of additional equity and cash generated from expected future sales will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs through twelve months from the condensed consolidated financial statement issuance date. Due to these factors, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. That is, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

Other than voting rights, the Class B common stock has the same rights as the Class A common stock, and therefore both are treated as the same class of stock for purposes of the earnings per share calculation. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and participating securities outstanding during the period. Participating securities include common and prefunded warrants. Net loss is not allocated to participating securities as they do not have an obligation to fund losses. For purposes of the diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders calculation, stock options, restricted stock units RSUs and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents. See Note 11 for further discussion of net income per share attributable to common stockholders.

 impairment losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Warrant Liability The Company accounts for its warrants in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity's Own Equity , as either liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. The warrants issued in connection with the September 2023 private placement and June 2024 registered direct offering (see Note 9) are classified as liabilities and are recorded at fair value. The warrants are subject to re-measurement at each settlement date and at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in other expense (income), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of the warrant liability using a Black-Scholes pricing model. We are required to make assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate term, risk-free interest rate, volatility factor, dividend yield, and the fair value of common stock. Any significant adjustments to the unobservable inputs would have a direct impact on the fair value of the warrant liability. of delivery.

The Company s stock options generally have contractual terms of and vest over a period of either three or from the date of grant.

 . As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value its stock option grants that vest based on the passage of time or the achievement of certain performance criteria and expenses the related compensation cost using the straight-line method over the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using assumptions for the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. Before the completion of the Company s IPO, the Board of Directors determined the fair value of common stock considering the state of the business, input from management, third party valuations and other considerations. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term used to determine the fair value of options. The expected volatility of the Class A common stock is partially based on the historical volatility of comparable companies in the industry whose share prices are publicly available. The Company uses a -dividend yield assumption as the Company has not paid dividends since inception nor does it anticipate paying dividends in the future. The risk-free interest rate approximates recent U.S. Treasury note auction results with a similar life to that of the option. The period expense is then determined based on the valuation of the options and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the fair value of time-based options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Risk-free interest rate Volatility factor Dividend yield During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted options that vested on a defined date following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s FDA clearance of the Company s EluPro product (referred to as CanGarooRM during development) product. With the FDA s approval of EluPro in June 2024, such vesting occurred in August 2024. Consistent with the above, these performance vesting options were valued using the Black-Scholes model. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also granted stock options that vest in equal installments upon the achievement of certain share price thresholds for twenty consecutive days of trading at each respective threshold. For these stock options, the Company accounted for the awards as market condition awards and used an option pricing model, the Monte Carlo model, to determine the fair value of the respective equity instruments and an expense recognition term of approximately . As of September 30, 2024, there were a total of stock options outstanding that are market condition stock option awards. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units RSUs represent rights to receive common shares at a future date. There is no exercise price and no monetary payment is required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award.

For the performance vesting RSUs, the fair value was based on the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The market condition RSUs are valued as described below. The respective fair values are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of generally three to . As of September 30, 2024, million of unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted RSUs that vested on a defined date following the FDA s clearance of the Company s EluPro product. With the FDA s approval of EluPro in June 2024, such vesting occurred in August 2024. These performance vesting RSUs were valued using the fair value of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant. The Company has also granted RSUs that vest in equal installments upon the achievement of certain share price thresholds for twenty consecutive days of trading at each respective threshold. For these RSUs, the Company accounted for the awards as market condition awards and used a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of these RSUs as well as the expense recognition term of approximately using the graded vesting method. As of September 30, 2024, there were RSUs outstanding that were market condition RSU awards. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company makes shares of its Class A common stock available for purchase under its 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ). The ESPP provides for separate offering periods that begin in March and September of each year. Under the ESPP, employees may purchase a limited number of shares of Elutia Class A common stock at of the fair market value on either the first day of the offering period or the purchase date, whichever is lower. The ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of stock-based compensation expense. The number of shares reserved under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of each fiscal year through January 1, 2030, in an amount as set forth in the ESPP. As of September 30, 2024, the total shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP was , of which remained available for future issuance. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of Class A common stock totaling and , respectively were issued under the ESPP.

 Work in process Finished goods Total million, and the Company amended the facility in May 2023, March 2024 and September 2024 (as amended, the SWK Loan Facility ). An initial draw of million was made in August 2022, and an additional million was made on December 14, 2022. The SWK Loan Facility also allows for the establishment of a separate, new asset-based revolving loan facility of up to million, which has not been entered into to date. The SWK Loan Facility matures on August 10, 2027 and accrues interest, payable quarterly in arrears. Principal amortization of the SWK Loan Facility, as amended in September 2024, starts in November 2025. Principal payments during the amortization period will be limited based on revenue-based caps, although as of September 30, 2024, no such caps are applicable and quarterly principal payments will be in an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount funded with the balance paid at maturity. T he SWK Loan Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by all assets of the Company, subject to certain customary exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, Elutia was in compliance with its financial covenants under the agreement governing the SWK Loan Facility SWK Loan Facility Agreement ). All of the SWK Loan Facility borrowings take the form of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loans and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of an applicable margin of (i) and the Term SOFR Rate (based upon an interest period of 3 months), or (ii) if the Company has elected the PIK Interest option (as defined below), and the Term SOFR Rate. The Company may elect a portion of the interest due, to be paid in-kind at a rate per annum of PIK Interest ), and such election may be made until November 15, 2025. The Term SOFR Rate is subject to a floor of . The agreement governing the SWK Loan Facility also includes an exit fee equal to of the aggregate principal amount funded prior to termination plus . The weighted average interest rate on the SWK Loan Facility was for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On August 10, 2022, the Company issued to SWK Funding LLC a warrant Class A Warrant to purchase, in the aggregate, up to shares of Class A common stock of the Company, par value per share at an exercise price of per share. The Class A Warrant is immediately exercisable for up to shares of Class A common stock from time to time on or after the Closing Date. The exercise price and number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Class A Warrant are subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and certain other events affecting the Class A common stock. Unless earlier exercised or terminated in accordance with its terms, the Class A Warrant will expire on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date. Upon issuance, the Company valued the Class A Warrant at approximately million using the Black-Scholes model. The recognition of the Class A Warrant as well as deferred financing costs of approximately million incurred in securing the SWK Loan Facility served to reduce the recorded value of the associated debt. The debt discount and deferred financing costs will be recognized as interest expense through the maturity of the loan. The SWK Loan Facility Agreement requires certain mandatory prepayments, subject to certain exceptions, with: (1) of any net casualty proceeds in excess of and (2) for non-ordinary course asset sales, an amount equal to the difference between (x) the proportion of divested gross profit (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility Agreement) to the Company s total gross profit (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility Agreement) multiplied by the outstanding loans under the SWK Loan Facility and (y) the difference between and the aggregate sale proceeds of any assets previously sold during the fiscal year.

 million. Of such amount, million wa s paid shortly after closing of the divestiture in 2023 and the remainder was paid in February 2024 based on mutual agreement between the parties. As noted above, the Company executed an amendment to the SWK Loan Facility in September 2024 which, among other items, served to defer the commencement of principal repayment from November 2024 to November 2025. Current Portion ) Long-Term Debt The fair value of all debt instruments, which is based on inputs considered to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy, approximates the respective carrying values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. million. Subject to annual minimum payments of million per year, the terms of the Revenue Interest Obligation required Elutia to pay Ligand of future sales of the products Elutia acquired from CorMatrix, including CanGaroo, ProxiCor, Tyke and VasCure, as well as products substantially similar to those products, such as the recently-approved EluPro. Furthermore, a million payment would be due to Ligand if cumulative sales of these products exceed million and a second million will be due if cumulative sales exceed million during the term of the agreement which expires on May 31, 2027. On January 10, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revenue Interest Obligation (the Amended Revenue Interest Obligation ). Pursuant to the Amended Revenue Interest Obligation, the parties modified and restructured the Revenue Interest Obligation by revising the annual minimum payments for 2024 and each subsequent fiscal year during the term of the agreement from million to million. Such minimums are payable quarterly within after each quarter-end date. Additionally, the Company made payments totaling million paid in January 2024 and paid in April 2024) in satisfaction of all royalty obligations for the first three fiscal quarters of 2023 and made a payment in February 2024 of million in satisfaction of the royalty obligations for the fourth quarter of 2023. Furthermore, as part of the Amended Revenue Interest Obligation, Ligand waived the Company s obligation to make the million milestone payment that became due to Ligand in the second quarter of 2023. Total payments to Ligand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million comprised of the aforementioned 2023 amounts due and 2024 quarterly minimum payments of million. The Company records the present value of the estimated total future payments under both the Revenue Interest Obligation and Amended Revenue Interest Obligation as a long-term obligation, with the short-term portion being recorded as described below. At each reporting period, the value of the Revenue Interest Obligation is re-measured based on current estimates of future payments, with changes to be recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations using the catch-up method. The Amended Revenue Interest Obligation changed the timing and extent of future payments by the Company to Ligand and such change to the estimated future payments yielded a reduction to the total obligation of approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The resulting gain was recognized as other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. Interest expense related to the Revenue Interest Obligation of approximately million and million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and approximately million and million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Each Common Warrant was exercisable until July 31, 2024, the date which was trading days after the clearance by the FDA of the Company s EluPro product, at an exercise price per share of . As discussed below, all Common Warrants were exercised before they expired. Each 2023 Prefunded Warrant is exercisable at any time at a nominal exercise price per share of (with the remainder of the exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock having been prefunded to the Company). The Company incurred transaction fees, including commissions and legal fees, of approximately million in connection with the Private Offering, of which million million as of September 30, 2023) were allocated to the issuance of the common stock. See below for discussion of the accounting for the warrants and the allocation of the remainder of the transaction fees from both the Registered Offering and Private Offering. Warrant Liabilities The Company has concluded that the 2024 Prefunded Warrants from the Registered Offering and the Common Warrants and the 2023 Prefunded Warrants from the Private Offering do not meet the equity contract scope exception under ASC 815-40 as in the event of a (i) fundamental transaction such as a merger and (ii) failure to timely deliver warrant shares upon exercise, certain provisions of which may require the Company to adjust the settlement value in a manner that is not consistent with a fixed-for-fixed option pricing model. As a result, with respect to the 2024 Prefunded Warrants, the Company allocated million of the gross proceeds from the Registered Offering to such warrants based on their fair value. Similarly, with respect to the Common Warrants and 2023 Prefunded Warrants, the Company allocated million of the gross proceeds from the Private Offering to such warrants based on their fair value. Additionally, the Company allocated a portion of the transaction fees from both the Registered Offering and the Private Offering to the respective warrants and recognized the expense within other expense (income), net. Such expenses totaled million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. such expenses were incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 of sales of the Elutia-manufactured tissue. The supply agreement expires on the same date as the related license agreement. royalties were paid to Cook during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Elutia has also entered into an amendment to the Cook License Agreement (the Cook Amendment in order to add fields of exclusive use. Specifically, the Cook Amendment provides for a worldwide exclusive license to the porcine tissue for use with neuromodulation devices in addition to cardiovascular devices. The Cook Amendment includes license fee payments of million per year in each of the years 2021 through 2026. Such license payments would accelerate if a change in control, as defined in the Cook Amendment, occurs within Elutia. The Company, in its sole discretion, can terminate the Cook License Agreement at any time. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be involved in claims and proceedings arising in the course of the Company s business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability, and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible, but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature of the matter and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, to the extent such estimate can be made. Accruals recorded are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available, and management's judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. FiberCel Litigation As previously disclosed, in June 2021, the Company announced a voluntary recall of a single lot of FiberCel fiber viable bone matrix FiberCel ). Since September 2021, product liability lawsuits or claims have been filed or asserted against the Company involving FiberCel. As of September 30, 2024, there were active lawsuits or claims against the Company, including lawsuits or claims where settlements have been reached but not yet been paid by quarter-end. The lawsuits, which have been filed against Elutia, certain Medtronic entities, and others, allege that the plaintiffs were exposed to and/or contracted tuberculosis and/or suffered substantial symptoms and complications following the implantation of FiberCel during orthopedic fusion operations. Such lawsuits were filed in various U.S. federal courts and in state courts in Indiana, Delaware, Florida, Maryland and Ohio. The Company refers to all of the aforementioned litigation, or claim notices, collectively as the FiberCel Litigation. Viable Bone Matrix Litigation As also previously disclosed, in July 2023, the Company announced a voluntary recall of a single lot of a certain viable bone matrix VBM product and the market withdrawal of all of its VBM products produced after a specified date (the VBM Recall ). As of September 30, 2024, there were active lawsuits or claims filed or asserted against the Company. The lawsuits, which have been filed against Elutia and others, allege that the plaintiffs were exposed to and/or contracted tuberculosis and/or suffered substantial symptoms and complications following the implantation of VBM during orthopedic fusion operations. Such lawsuits were filed in various U.S. federal courts and in the California state court. The Company refers to all of the aforementioned litigation, or claim notices, collectively as the VBM Litigation.

 lawsuits against the Company alleging claims arising from the use of FiberCel products distributed by Medtronic. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages owed by Medtronic for these breaches. On July 31, 2024, Medtronic responded to the complaint by denying Elutia s claims and asserting a single counterclaim alleging that Elutia breached certain representations and warranties under the Supply Agreement and owes ongoing indemnity obligations to Medtronic. The counterclaim does not specify the amount of any alleged damages. On October 15, 2024, Medtronic filed a motion to dismiss Elutia s claims, and a hearing is set for January 9, 2025. Given the early stages of this matter and the Company s intention to vigorously defend this counterclaim, we do not consider a loss to be probable or estimable at this time. Contingent Liability for Legal Proceedings FiberCel Litigation . Since August 2022, the Company has engaged in a process to negotiate and attempt to resolve many of the cases in the FiberCel Litigation. In total, Elutia s liability in of the cases has been settled for a total cash outlay of million. For the remaining cases, the Company estimated a probable loss related to each case and has recorded a liability at a total estimated amount of million at September 30, 2024, which is recorded as Contingent Liability for Legal Proceedings in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Such liability includes million for which the settlements have been reached but have not yet been paid. In order to reasonably estimate the liability for the unsettled FiberCel Litigation cases, the Company, along with outside legal counsel, has assessed a variety of factors, including (i) the extent of the injuries incurred, (ii) recent experience on the settled claims, (iii) settlement offers made to the other parties to the litigation and (iv) any other factors that may have a material effect on the FiberCel Litigation. While the Company believes its estimated liability to be reasonable, the actual loss amounts are highly variable and are dependent upon the relevant facts and case by case resolutions. As more information is learned about asserted claims and potential future trends, adjustments may be made to this Contingent Liability for Legal Proceedings as appropriate. Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur liabilities in excess of amounts accrued and the ultimate liability could be material to the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the period recognized. The Company, however, is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time. VBM Litigation Since June 2023, the Company has also engaged in a process to negotiate and attempt to resolve many of the cases in the VBM Litigation. In total, Elutia s liability in of the cases has been settled for a total cash outlay of approximately million. For the remaining cases, which includes unasserted claims that the Company believes are probable of assertion, the Company estimated a probable loss at an estimated amount of million at September 30, 2024, which is recorded as Contingent Liability for Legal Proceedings in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The expense related to this estimate was recorded within Litigation costs, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations, with the entirety of such expense offset by the insurance received or receivable as further described below. In order to reasonably estimate the liability for the unsettled VBM Litigation cases and unasserted claims, the Company, along with outside legal counsel, has assessed a variety of factors, including (i) the extent of the injuries incurred, (ii) recent experience on the settled claims, (iii) settlement offers made to the other parties to the litigation and (iv) any other factors that may have a material effect on the VBM Litigation.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto, and the discussion under Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates, plans and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that involve risks and may affect our future operating results and financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report and in the section entitled Risk Factor Summary and in Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors of our Annual Report. Overview At Elutia, our mission is to humanize medicine so that patients can thrive without compromise. As a commercial-stage company, we seek to leverage our unique understanding of biologics combined with local drug delivery to improve the interaction between implanted medical devices and patients by reducing complications associated with these surgeries. These complications include infection, device migration, erosion, implant rejection, non-union of implants, fibrosis and scar formation. We estimate that, over the past two years, more than 700,000 surgical procedures were performed per year in the United States in which the patient was implanted with medical devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, neuro-stimulators or tissue expanders for breast reconstruction. This number has been driven by advances in medical device technologies, reimbursement models focused on patient outcomes, and an aging population with a growing incidence of comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases. These comorbidities can exacerbate various immune responses and contribute to other complications upon device implant. Our products are targeted to address unmet clinical needs with the goal of promoting healthy tissue formation and avoiding complications associated with medical device implants, such as scar tissue formation, capsular contraction, erosion, migration and implant rejection. These products currently focus on our priority markets Device Protection and Women s Health. Device Protection In Device Protection, we sell EluPro, a unique bioenvelope designed to secure implanted devices, mitigating complications such as migration and erosion. The bioenvelope features a biomatrix comprised of extracellular matrix (ECM), which supports healthy wound healing and may facilitate re-operative procedures by reducing scar formation and fibrosis. Additionally, EluPro is embedded with the powerful antibiotics rifampin and minocycline, which are gradually released into the surrounding tissue over several weeks post-implantation to provide antimicrobial protection. EluPro was cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in June 2024 and is indicated for use with implantable electronic devices including cardiac and neurostimulator devices. EluPro is the only drug-eluting biomatrix DEB offering in the U.S. implantable electronic device protection market, which is comprised of approximately 600,000 procedures per year in the United States. EluPro is currently available on a limited basis in advance of its full commercial launch anticipated for the first quarter of 2025. Alongside EluPro, we continue to market the CanGaroo bioenvelope, our first generation product, which uses the same biomatrix but does not contain antibiotics. EluPro and CanGaroo are sold primarily through our internal sales force and independent sales agents. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these products generated revenue of 7.3 million. We produce all of our Device Protection and Cardiovascular (see below) products at our manufacturing facility in Roswell, Georgia and stock inventory of raw materials, supplies and finished goods at this location. We rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and supplies. We have a long-term supply agreement with Cook Biotech (now owned by RTI Surgical), the porcine tissue supplier of our raw materials for our bioenvelope and cardiovascular products.

 Women s Health In Women s Health, we have developed both patented and proprietary technologies, culminating in the creation of SimpliDerm a novel biological matrix that leverages the inherent science of natural healing processes. SimpliDerm s design uses human acellular dermal matrix hADM with heightened structural integrity and superior handling capabilities, which may mitigate inflammation and enhance tissue incorporation, leading to a better healing experience as compared to other hADM products. We believe that these acellular dermal matrices represent an ideal choice for tissue repair and reconstruction, finding applications in fields such as breast reconstruction, sports medicine, hernia repair and trauma reconstruction. SimpliDerm is primarily used in breast reconstruction surgeries, of which approximately 150,000 are performed each year in the United States. SimpliDerm is sold through both independent sales agents and our distributor, Tiger Aesthetics Medical. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SimpliDerm generated revenue of 9.2 million. SimpliDerm has historically been processed by us at our Richmond, California facility; however, that facility was included with the sale of the Orthobiologics Business described below, and SimpliDerm is now being provided to us on a go-forward basis through a long-term supply agreement with the purchaser of the Orthobiologics Business, Berkeley Biologics, LLC. We also intend to develop our own in-house capability for the production of SimpliDerm. Cardiovascular We also sell legacy products into the Cardiovascular market. In Cardiovascular, we sell our specialized porcine small intestine submucosa, which is also the biomatrix used to make EluPro and CanGaroo, for use as an intracardiac and vascular patch as well as for pericardial reconstruction. In addition, our TYKE product is designed for use in the neonatal patient population. These cardiovascular products are sold in the United States through an exclusive distribution agreement with LeMaitre Vascular. This agreement also provided LeMaitre with an option to acquire the Cardiovascular product line through March 2026. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Cardiovascular products generated revenue of 2.4 million. Pipeline Products With respect to pipeline products, we are pioneering DEBs to help solve problems unaddressed by available options. As described above, EluPro is our first DEB product offering. We also intend to leverage our DEB platform technology by developing and commercializing products for markets with similar unmet needs, including breast reconstruction and neurostimulation. Discontinued Operations Sale of Orthobiologics Business On November 8, 2023, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets relating to our former Orthobiologics segment (the Orthobiologics Business to Berkeley Biologics, LLC Berkeley ). The Orthobiologics Business was comprised of assets relating to researching, developing, administering, insuring, operating, commercializing, manufacturing, selling and marketing our Orthobiologics products, and the business of contract manufacturing of particulate bone, precision milled bone, cellular bone matrix, acellular dermis, soft tissue and other products. The assets sold represent the entirety of our Orthobiologics segment. In the sale, we received approximately 14.6 million, and we may earn up to an additional 20 million, in the aggregate, in the form of earn-out payments. The earn-out payments are equal to 10 of the actual revenue earned by Berkeley in each of the five years after the closing of the sale from sales of specified Orthobiologics products under the purchase agreement (including improvements, modifications, derivatives and enhancements related to those products). There were no earn-out payments earned or paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the purchase agreement provides for a customary indemnity holdback in the amount of 1.5 million to be retained by Berkeley for 24 months after close. In the purchase agreement, the Company has retained the liabilities arising out of the VBM and FiberCel matters, as described in Note 10, both of which products were part of the Orthobiologics Business. We recognized a gain of 6.0 million on the sale of the Orthobiologics Business in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an additional gain of 0.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 from an adjustment payment related to the final working capital received by Berkeley at the sale date. The indemnity holdback is available as a source of

 recovery for Berkeley for claims of indemnification under the purchase agreement, and some or all of the holdback may be retained by Berkeley if Berkeley is successful in asserting a claim or claims for indemnification against us. Should we receive incremental proceeds in the future through an earn-out payment or payment of the holdback amount, an additional gain will be recorded upon the receipt of such amounts. Product Recalls In June 2021, we issued a voluntary recall pertaining to a single donor lot of our FiberCel Fiber Viable Bone Matrix, a bone repair product formerly manufactured under a contract with Medtronic PLC, which also distributed the product. The recall was issued after learning of postsurgical infections reported in several patients treated with the product, including some patients that tested positive for tuberculosis. Additionally, i n July 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of a single lot of one of our viable bone matrix VBM products and the market withdrawal of all of our VBM products produced after a specified date. Notice of the voluntary recall was issued to centers after we learned of post-surgical tuberculosis infections in two patients treated with product from a single donor lot of our VBM product. Both of these products were part of our Orthobiologics Business, which we have fully divested as described above. For information about legal proceedings in which we are involved and the possible future financial implications, see Note 10 to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Components of Our Results of Operations Net Sales We recognize revenue on the sale of our products. Our device protection products are sold to hospitals and other healthcare facilities primarily through our direct sales force, commercial partners or independent sales agents. Our cardiovascular products are sold domestically through a distribution agreement with LeMaitre Vascular and were previously sold internationally through commercial partners. Our women s health products are sold directly to hospitals and other healthcare facilities through independent sales agents or through our distribution agreement with Tiger Aesthetics Medical. Expenses In recent years, we have incurred significant costs in the operation of our business. We expect that our recurring operating costs will largely stabilize, or increase at modest rates, in the near future through the identification of efficiencies as we grow. We may, however, still experience more significant expense increases to the extent we expand our sales and marketing, product development and clinical and research activities. As a result, we will need to generate significant net sales in order to achieve profitability. Below is a breakdown of our main expense categories and the related expenses incurred in each category: Cost of Goods Sold Our cost of goods sold relate to purchased raw materials and the processing and conversion costs of such raw materials consisting primarily of salaries and benefits, supplies, quality control testing and the manufacturing overhead incurred at our processing facilities in Roswell, Georgia and our former Orthobiologics facility in Richmond, California. The Roswell facility has additional capacity, which if utilized, would further leverage our fixed overhead. Cost of goods sold also includes the amortization of intangibles generated from the CorMatrix Acquisition in 2017. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses are primarily related to our direct sales force, consisting of salaries, commission compensation, fringe benefits, meals and other expenses. Auto and travel costs also contribute to sales and marketing expenses. Outside of our direct sales force, we incur significant expenses relating to commissions to our CanGaroo and SimpliDerm commercial partners and independent sales agents. Additionally, this expense category includes distribution costs as well as market research, trade show attendance, advertising and public relations related to our products, and customer service expenses.

 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative G A expenses consist primarily of compensation, consulting, legal, human resources, information technology, accounting, insurance and general business expenses. Our G A expenses have increased as a result of operating as a public company, especially as a result of hiring additional personnel and incurring greater director and officer insurance premiums, greater investor relations costs, and additional costs associated with accounting, legal, tax-related and other services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements. Research and Development Expenses Research and development R D expenses consist primarily of salaries and fringe benefits, laboratory supplies, clinical studies and outside service costs. Over the last several years, our product development efforts have primarily related to activities associated with the development of EluPro (referred to as CanGarooRM during development), our initial DEB product offering. See above for discussion of the June 2024 FDA approval of EluPro. Future development efforts are expected to focus on (i) expanding the EluPro offering with additional sizes and product features and (ii) developing new products within the DEB product portfolio. We also conduct clinical studies to validate the performance characteristics of our products and to capture patient data necessary to support our commercial efforts. Litigation Costs, net Litigation costs, net consist primarily of legal fees and the estimated costs to resolve the outstanding FiberCel and VBM litigation cases offset by the estimated and actual amounts recoverable or recovered under insurance, indemnity and contribution agreements for such costs.

Revenues from Women s Health increased compared to the prior year s third quarter due primarily to volume growth; however, such increase was offset by slight volume declines between years in Device Protection and Cardiovascular. As noted above, our new Device Protection product, EluPro, was approved by the FDA in June 2024 and first sold commercially in September 2024. EluPro is currently available to our customers on a limited basis in advance of its full commercial launch in the first quarter of 2025. The decline in Device Protection revenue between years was partially caused by certain of our customers suspending purchases of CanGaroo and waiting to procure EluPro when it becomes more broadly available.

Gross margin was 46.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 consistent with the 46.4 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, was 60.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased 0.2 million, or 6.7 , to 3.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expenses increased to 50.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 45.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expense was largely attributable to the non-cash equity compensation grants made in January 2024. General and Administrative G A expenses increased 1.7 million, or 64.0 , to 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, G A expenses increased to 76.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 45.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expense was primarily driven by the non-cash equity compensation grants made in January 2024. Research and Development R D expenses increased 0.2 million, or 39.7 to 0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expense was largely attributable to the non-cash equity compensation grants made in January 2024. Over the last several years, our R D efforts have primarily related to activities associated with the development of EluPro. With the FDA approval of EluPro in June 2024, our development efforts are focused on the areas described under the heading "Overview" above. Litigation Costs, net Litigation costs, net increased to 4.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The continued evaluation of our contingent liability for legal proceedings resulted in higher expenses in the 2024 period. Such increase was partially offset by our recovery in September

Interest Expense Interest expense was approximately 1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower principal outstanding on the SWK debt in the current year period as a result of mandatory repayments in connection with our sale of the Orthobiologics Business in November 2023.

Gross margin was 44.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, was 57.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the Cardiovascular business which decreased due to the commencement of the LeMaitre Vascular distribution agreement described above. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses decreased 0.9 million, or 8.4 , to 9.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 50.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expense was largely attributable to the previously announced reduction in force which occurred at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and primarily impacted certain members of sales and marketing management. General and Administrative G A expenses increased 4.1 million, or 40.7 , to 14.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, G A expenses increased to 75.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expense resulted largely from the non-cash equity compensation grants made in January 2024. Research and Development R D expenses were 3.0 million in both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Over the last several years, our R D efforts have primarily related to activities associated with the development of EluPro (referred to as CanGarooRM during development). With the FDA s approval of EluPro in June 2024, such related costs were less in the first nine months of 2024 versus the prior year s comparable period, but such decrease was offset by non-cash equity compensation recognized in the 2024 period. See Overview above for discussion of future development projects.

 Litigation Costs, net Litigation costs, net increased to 8.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The continued evaluation of our contingent liability for legal proceedings resulted in higher expenses in the 2024 period. Such increase was partially offset by our recovery in September 2024 of 1.6 million in connection with the settlement of certain disputed indemnity and contribution amounts related to the FiberCel Litigation. See further discussion in Note 10 to condensed consolidated financial statements. Interest Expense Interest expense was approximately 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower principal outstanding on the SWK debt in the current year period as a result of mandatory repayments in connection with our sale of the Orthobiologics Business in November 2023. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 millon and loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.3 million. See Notes 1 and 4 to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Quarterly Report presents our gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We calculate gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, as gross profit, excluding amortization expense relating to intangible assets we acquired in the CorMatrix Acquisition, divided by net sales. Gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, is a supplemental measure of our performance, is not defined by or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to our GAAP gross margin, gross profit or any other financial performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We present gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, because we believe that it provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by removing the impact of amortization expense, which is not indicative of our overall operating performance. We believe this provides our management and investors with useful information to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. Our management uses this metric in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance, and we believe investors understanding of our operating performance is similarly enhanced by our presentation of this metric. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may use other measures to evaluate their performance, which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP financial measure as a tool for comparison.

 The following table presents a reconciliation of our gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is our GAAP gross margin (in thousands). 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 5,922 6,127 18,907 18,870 Cost of goods sold 3,181 3,286 10,524 9,943 Gross profit 2,741 2,841 8,383 8,927 Intangible asset amortization expense 849 849 2,547 2,547 Gross profit, excluding intangible asset amortization 3,590 3,690 10,930 11,474 Gross margin 46.3 46.4 44.3 47.3 Gross margin, excluding intangible asset amortization 60.6 60.2 57.8 60.8 Seasonality Historically, we have experienced seasonality, with lower sales in our first and second quarters and higher sales in our fourth quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. We have experienced and may in the future experience, higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of hospitals in the United States increasing their purchases of our products to coincide with the end of their budget cycles. Satisfaction of patient deductibles throughout the course of the year also results in increased sales later in the year, once patients have paid their annual insurance deductibles in full, which reduces their out-of-pocket costs. Conversely, our first quarter generally has lower sales than the preceding fourth quarter as patient deductibles are re-established with the new year, which increases their out-of-pocket costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 25.7 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through amounts borrowed under our credit facilities, proceeds from our initial public offering IPO ), sales of our products and more recently, the sale of our Orthobiologics Business and proceeds from a follow-on offering and private placements of our common stock and warrants. Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with acquisitions and integration, manufacturing and administrative costs, general and marketing, research and development, clinical activity, purchase of property and equipment used in our production activities, litigation costs and investing in our commercial infrastructure through our direct sales force and our commercial partners in order to expand our presence and to promote awareness and adoption of our products. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 220.5 million. On June 18, 2024, we sold, in a registered direct offering Registered Offering an aggregate of (i) 3,175,000 shares Common Shares of the Company s Class A common stock and (ii) prefunded warrants 2024 Prefunded Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 725,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. The public offering price for each share of Class A Common Stock was 3.40, and the public offering price for each 2024 Prefunded Warrant was 3.399 , for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 13.3 million, before deducting offering expenses. The 2024 Prefunded Warrants have an exercise price of 0.001 per share of Class A Common Stock, are exercisable immediately and will expire when exercised in full. On September 21, 2023, we sold, in a private offering Private Offering an aggregate of (i) 6,852,811 units Common Units ), each comprised of (a) one share of our Class A common stock and (b) a warrant Common Warrant to purchase one and one half shares of Class A Common Stock, and (ii) 503,058 units (the Prefunded Units ), each comprised of (a) a prefunded warrant 2023 Prefunded Warrant to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock, and (b) a Common Warrant. The Common Units were sold at a purchase price of 1.4275 per unit, and the 2023 Prefunded Units were sold at a purchase price of 1.4265 per unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 10.5 million, before deducting offering expenses. Each Common Warrant was exercisable until July 31, 2024, the date which was 30 trading days after the clearance by the FDA of the Company s EluPro product, at an exercise price per share of 1.4275.

Table of Contents 
 All Common Warrants were exercised by such date yielding exercise proceeds of 13.8 million in July 2024. Certain of these exercises ultimately resulted in their conversion to 2023 Prefunded Warrants. Each 2023 Prefunded Warrant is exercisable at any time at a nominal exercise price per share of 0.001 (with the remainder of the exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock having been prefunded to us). We expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future and these losses will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial position. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization and development efforts, including our ability to successfully commercialize our new EluPro product, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Our inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In order to mitigate the current and potential future liquidity issues caused by the matters noted above, we may seek to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, such as the Registerd Offering and Private Offering described above, pursue asset sale or other transactions, such as the sale of the Orthobiologics Business described above. However, such transactions may not be successful, and we may not be able to raise additional equity, refinance our debt instruments, or sell assets on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, based on our current operating plans, we believe there is uncertainty as to whether our future cash flows along with our existing cash, issuances of additional equity and cash generated from expected future sales will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs through twelve months from the financial statement issuance date. Due to these factors, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of the financial statements. Cash Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (10,400) (12,678) Investing activities (380) (329) Financing activities 17,245 10,535 Net decrease in cash 6,465 (2,472) Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.4 million compared to 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a lower net loss (excluding non-cash items) as well as reductions in inventory held. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current year period reflects the purchase of property and equipment for our production facilities and the receipt of 0.2 million from an adjustment payment related to the final working capital received by Berkeley at the sale date. The prior year period use of cash is related to the purchase of property and equipment for our production activities. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.2 million compared to 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was caused primarily by warrant exercises which yielded proceeds of 15.7 million offset by repayments of long-term debt and payments on the revenue interest obligation which collectively totalled 8.3 million. No such activity occurred in the 2023 period.

 Credit Facilities General O n August 10, 2022 (the Closing Date ), we entered into a senior secured term loan facility with SWK Funding LLC SWK ), as agent, and other lenders party thereto (as amended and modified subsequent to the Closing Date, the SWK Loan Facility for an aggregate principal amount of 25 million. An initial draw of 21 million was made on the Closing Date with the additional 4 million drawn on December 14, 2022. The SWK Loan Facility also allows for the establishment of a separate, new asset-based revolving loan facility of up to 8 million, which has not been entered into to date. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22.6 million of indebtedness outstanding under our SWK Loan Facility, with such balance being net of 0.6 million of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. Interest Rates All of the SWK Loan Facility borrowings take the form of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loans and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of an applicable margin of (i) 7.75 and the Term SOFR Rate (based upon an interest period of 3 months), or (ii) if we have elected the PIK Interest option (as defined below), 3.75 and the Term SOFR Rate. We may elect a portion of the interest due, to be paid in-kind at a rate per annum of 4.5 PIK Interest ), and such election may be made until November 15, 2025. The Term SOFR Rate is subject to a floor of 2.75 . Mandatory Prepayments The SWK Loan Facility Agreement requires certain mandatory prepayments, subject to certain exceptions, with: (1) 100 of any net casualty proceeds in excess of 250,000 and (2) for non-ordinary course asset sales, an amount equal to the difference between (x) the proportion of divested gross profit (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) to the Company s total gross profit (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) multiplied by the outstanding loans under the SWK Loan Facility, and (y) the difference between 1,000,000 and the aggregate sale proceeds of any assets previously sold during the fiscal year. The closing of the sale of the Orthobiologics Business in November 2023 triggered the mandatory prepayment of 4.0 million. Of such amount, 2.0 million wa s paid shortly after closing of the divestiture of the Orthobiologics Business in 2023 and the remainder was paid on February 15, 2024 based on mutual agreement between the parties. No such mandatory prepayments were required in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Optional Prepayment The agreement, as amended, governing the SWK Loan Facility also includes an exit fee equal to 6.5 of the aggregate principal amount funded prior to termination plus 112,500. Amortization and Final Maturity The SWK Loan Facility matures on August 10, 2027 and accrues interest, payable quarterly in arrears. Principal amortization of the SWK Loan Facility starts on November 15, 2025. Principal payments during the amortization period will be limited based on revenue-based caps. As of September 30, 2024, quarterly principal payments will be in an amount equal to 5 of the aggregate principal amount funded with the balance paid at maturity. Security All obligations under the SWK Loan Facility are, and any future guarantees of those obligations will be, secured by, among other things, and in each case subject to certain exceptions, a first priority lien on and security interest in, upon, and to all of our assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, wherever located.

 Covenants and Other Matters The SWK Loan Facility Agreement that governs the SWK Loan Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; incur certain liens; pay dividends or make other distributions on equity interests; redeem, repurchase or refinance subordinated indebtedness; consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of assets; make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend or modify our governing documents; amend or modify certain material agreements; and alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries. 
 In addition, the SWK Loan Facility Agreement contains two financial covenants. The first covenant, which is measured quarterly, requires us to achieve a specified Minimum Aggregate Revenue (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) for the preceding 12-month period or, alternatively, to maintain Consolidated Unencumbered Liquid Assets (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) greater than either (i) the outstanding principal balance of the loan, or (ii) the aggregate operating cash burn (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) for the preceding 12-month period. The second covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity (as defined in the SWK Loan Facility) of the greater of (a) 5.0 million and (b) the sum of the operating cash burn for the two prior consecutive fiscal quarters then ended (the Liquidity Covenant ). On March 27, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the SWK Loan Facility Agreement, which modified the Minimum Aggregate Revenue covenant under the SWK Facility to provide that as of the last business day of each fiscal quarter of the Company beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2024, our required Minimum Aggregate Revenue (as defined in the SWK Facility) for the trailing twelve-month period must be equal to or greater than 20.0 million. On September 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the SWK Loan Facility Agreement, which (i) deferred the commencement of principal repayment under the SWK Facility from November 15, 2024 to November 15, 2025, (ii) extended the date until which the Company may elect a portion of the interest due under the SWK Facility to be paid in-kind from November 15, 2024 to November 15, 2025, and (iii) modified the exit fee upon termination of the SWK Facility from (a) 6.50 of the aggregate amount of Term Loan funded prior to such termination date plus 62,500 to (b) 6.50 of the aggregate amount of Term Loan funded prior to such termination date plus 112,500. The SWK Loan Facility Agreement contains events of default, including, most significantly, a failure to timely pay interest or principal, insolvency, or an action by the FDA or such other material adverse event impacting the operations of Elutia. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants.

 Funding Requirements We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our product development and clinical and research activities. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses associated with operating as a public company. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22.6 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of 23.2 million outstanding under our SWK Loan Facility, net of 0.6 million of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. Such indebtedness currently has a principal payment commencement date of November 15, 2025, with quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to 5 of the outstanding principal. In addition, we are party to a royalty agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Ligand pursuant to a long-term obligation to Ligand (the Revenue Interest Obligation ). The Revenue Interest Obligation, as amended in January 2024, requires us to pay Ligand 5.0 of future sales of our CanGaroo, ProxiCor, Tyke and VasCure products, and substantially similar products, through May 31, 2027, subject to annual minimum payments of 4.4 million. If our available cash balances and cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, or asset sale or other transactions. However, such transactions may not be successful and we may not be able to raise additional equity or debt, or sell or license assets on acceptable terms, or at all. We may also consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, pursue strategic investments or take advantage of financing opportunities. Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, among other things: the cost of fully commercializing our EluPro product; continued patient, physician and market acceptance of our products; the scope, rate of progress and cost of our current and future pre-clinical and clinical studies; the cost of our research and development activities and the cost and timing of commercializing new products or technologies; the cost and timing of expanding our sales and marketing capabilities; the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights; the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party patents or other intellectual property rights; the costs of defending against or the damages payable in connection with the FiberCel Litigation and any future litigation that we may be subject to (to the extent above the applicable insurance coverage); the cost and timing of additional regulatory approvals; costs associated with any product recall that may occur; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products; the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses in the future, although we may currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions; 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 the costs of operating as a public company; unanticipated general, legal and administrative expenses; and the effects on any of the above from any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease. 
 In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of any number of factors, including those set forth above and other factors currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than anticipated. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, creating liens, redeeming shares of our common stock and/or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, licensing agreements or other strategic alliances, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay the development or commercialization of our products, license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize and reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. See our Annual Report, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all . Based on our current operating plans, we believe there is uncertainty as to whether our future cash flows along with our existing cash, issuances of additional equity and cash generated from expected future sales will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs through twelve months from the financial statement issuance date. Due to these factors, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of the financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We have discussed the policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our Annual Report, and, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to those previously disclosed other than those outlined in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Standards, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. JOBS Act Section 107 of the JOBS Act permits us, as an emerging growth company, to take advantage of an extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, unless we subsequently choose to affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which election is irrevocable. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of 2025; (iii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 equity held by non-affiliates is 700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including risks relating to changes in interest rates, foreign currency and inflation. The following discussion provides additional information regarding these risks. Interest Rate Risk Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates. Borrowings under our SWK Loan Facility bear interest at variable rates, subject to an interest rate floor. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. A hypothetical 10 relative change in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness outstanding at September 30, 2024 would not have had a material effect on our financial statements. We do not currently engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. Credit Risk As of September 30, 2024, our cash was maintained with two financial institutions in the United States. While our deposit accounts are insured up to the legal limit, the balances we maintain may, at times, exceed this insured limit. We believe these financial institutions have sufficient assets and liquidity to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business with little or no credit risk to us. Foreign Currency Risk Our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars. Any transactions that may be conducted in foreign currencies are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we grow our operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in claims and proceedings arising in the course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. For information about legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described as risk factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual operating results and financial condition to vary materially from past, or anticipated future, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these potential risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock. There have been no material changes in our risk factors to those included in our Annual Report. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any " -1 trading arrangement" (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
