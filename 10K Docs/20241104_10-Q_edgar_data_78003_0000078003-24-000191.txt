 The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results do not purport to reflect what the combined company s results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor do they project the future results of operations of the combined company or reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated with the acquisition. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected here due to many factors. 
 The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes various assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Seagen. The historical U.S. GAAP financial information of Pfizer and Seagen was adjusted, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023: 
 Additional amortization expense of approximately million and million, respectively, related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired. 
 Additional expense related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold of approximately million and million, respectively. 
 Additional estimated interest expense of approximately million and million, respectively, related to the debt issued by Pfizer and the commercial paper borrowings to partially finance the acquisition. 
 Elimination of interest income of approximately million and million, respectively, related to the debt issuance proceeds that were invested prior to the acquisition date and associated with money market funds under the assumption that a portion of these funds would have been liquidated to partially fund the acquisition. 
 The above adjustments were then adjusted for the applicable tax impact using an estimated weighted-average statutory tax rate applied to the applicable pro forma adjustments. 
 B. Equity-Method Investment 
 Haleon We owned of Haleon as of December 31, 2023. In March 2024, we sold approximately of our investment in Haleon through the sale of million ordinary shares in a global public offering, and the sale of million ordinary shares directly to Haleon, for total consideration of billion. We recognized a gain on the sale of our Haleon shares of million during the first quarter of 2024 in Other (income)/deductions net (see Note 4 ). After the share sale, we owned approximately of the outstanding voting shares of Haleon as of September 29, 2024. 
 The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of September 29, 2024, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was billion. Haleon is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. We record our share of earnings from Haleon on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions net .

 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to for the third quarter of 2023, and was for the first nine months of 2024, compared to ) for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily a result of the jurisdictional mix of earnings and, to a lesser extent, tax benefits related to the closing of IRS audits covering multiple tax years. The positive effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the first nine months ended October 1, 2023, was primarily due to the non-recurrence of tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years in the second quarter of 2023 partially offset by tax benefits related to the closing of the IRS audits covering multiple tax years. 
 We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The sixth annual installment was paid by its April 15, 2024 due date. The seventh annual installment is due April 15, 2025 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of September 29, 2024. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary due to the availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards or carrybacks. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was billion, of which billion was paid in the U.S. 
 B. Tax Contingencies 
 We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. 
 The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. During the third quarter of 2024, we effectively settled the audit of Pfizer s federal income tax returns for years 2016-2018. Tax years 2019-2024 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.

 The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.

 In October 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in the U.S. starting in November 2023. In connection with this agreement, we recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the expected return of an estimated million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory. In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash favorable final adjustment of million to reflect million EUA-labeled treatment courses returned through February 29, 2024, which were converted to a volume-based credit that supports continued access to Paxlovid through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by Pfizer. In the third quarter of 2024, in connection with this amended agreement, we also supplied at no cost to the U.S. government or taxpayers a U.S. SNS of million treatment courses to enable future pandemic preparedness through 2028, and recorded revenue of million. While we are recognizing revenue as the million treatment courses are delivered, there is no cash consideration for these treatment courses. 
 Revenues from the U.S. government comprised of total revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and for both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. Revenues from the U.S. government as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended October 1, 2023 were not material.

billion and billion, respectively, as of September 29, 2024, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of these amounts, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2024 through 2028, the timing of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter of 2024 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year. Remaining performance obligations associated with contracts for other products and services were not significant as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Deferred Revenues Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers for supply of Paxlovid and Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled billion as of September 29, 2024, with billion and billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled billion as of December 31, 2023, with billion and billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by amounts recognized in Product revenues as we delivered the products to our customers (including million associated with the U.S. SNS for Paxlovid) as well as the aforementioned million favorable final adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for Paxlovid, partially offset by additional advance payments received in the first nine months of 2024 as we entered into amended contracts. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recognized revenue of approximately billion and billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2023. The Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues as of September 29, 2024 will be recognized in Product revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the products to our customers and satisfy our performance obligations under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues from 2025 through 2028. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 GENERAL 
 The following MD A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty income (substantially all of which is related to our Biopharma segment) from Other (income)/deductions net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior-period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation. 
 
 OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK 
 Our Business and Strategy Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. Our 2024 key priorities are: 
 Achieve world-class oncology leadership 
 Deliver next wave of pipeline innovation 
 Maximize performance of our new products 
 Expand margins by realigning our cost base 
 Allocate capital to enhance shareholder value 
 One way we believe we will be more efficient, effective and able to execute on these five strategic priorities is through technology, including artificial intelligence. 
 We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of three operating segments: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A . 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program (Realigning Our Cost Base Program) that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold (Manufacturing Optimization Program), which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements. See Note 3 . For a description of anticipated savings related to these programs, see the Costs and Expenses Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD A . 
 For additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Our Business Development Initiatives We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 22, 2024, the filing date of our 2023 Form 10-K, see Note 2 in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 2 for significant recent activities. 
 Our Third Quarter 2024 and First Nine Months of 2024 Performance 
 Total Revenues Total revenues increased 4.2 billion, or 31 , in the third quarter of 2024 to 17.7 billion from 13.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an operational increase of 4.3 billion, or 32 , partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 133 million, or 1 . The operational increase was primarily driven by growth from Paxlovid, revenues from legacy Seagen products acquired in December 2023 and growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz and Ibrance. Excluding contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty, Total revenues increased 1.7 billion, or 14 , operationally. 
 Total revenues increased 880 million, or 2 , in the first nine months of 2024 to 45.9 billion from 45.0 billion in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an operational increase of 1.3 billion, or 3 , partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 411 million, or 1 . The operational increase was primarily driven by revenues from legacy Seagen 
 39 

products acquired in December 2023 as well as growth from the Vyndaqel family, Paxlovid and Eliquis, partially offset by declines from Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty, Total revenues increased 4.6 billion, or 13 , operationally. 
 See the Total Revenues by Geography and Total Revenues Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates. See also The Global Economic Environment COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 13C . 
 Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income (Loss) Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss) in the third quarter of 2024 was 4.7 billion, compared to a loss of 3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to (i) higher revenues, (ii) a decrease in Cost of sales and (iii) net gains on equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by (iv) higher net interest expense and (v) a charge in the third quarter of 2024 to Other (income)/deductions net related to the discontinuation of our DMD program. 
 The increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of 2.8 billion, to 8.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from 5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, was primarily due to (i) a decrease in Cost of sales, (ii) higher revenues and (iii) net gains on equity securities in the first nine months of 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by (iv) higher net interest expense, (v) increases in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs and Amortization of intangible assets and (vi) charges in 2024 to Other (income)/deductions net related to the discontinuation of our DMD program . 
 See the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations section within MD A and Note 4 . For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income/(Loss) section within MD A and Note 5 . 
 Our Operating Environment We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below, as well as in the Item 1. Business Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook Our Operating Environment section of the MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2024 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. 
 For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section of our 2023 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation involving certain of our products, see Note 12A1 . 
 Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access Government and Other Payor Group Pressures Governments globally, as well as private third-party payors in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Presidential Administration on regulating drug pricing regardless of which party comes to power following the upcoming November 2024 elections. Implementation of the drug pricing provisions of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, will continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program), which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Eliquis was among the first ten medicines subject to the Program. On August 15, 2024, the U.S. government released the new Medicare price for Eliquis, which, effective January 1, 2026, will be 231.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply. The Eliquis Medicare price will be factored into our long-term financial planning, in accordance with our standard financial reporting and forecasting protocols. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, lead to 
 40 

lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or the 340B Drug Pricing Program (the 340B Program), including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B Program, could have a material impact on our business. See the Item 1. Business Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors Pricing and Reimbursement sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook Our Operating Environment section of the MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 Impact of the July 2023 Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC) Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables, including anesthesia, analgesia, and micronutrients. Supply of medicines has recovered from the impact of the tornado. 
 We incurred losses in 2023 and 2024 that were partially offset by insurance recoveries received in 2023. We expect to record additional insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Product Supply We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. In 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. Regulatory authorities have issued updated guidance on nitrosamine acceptable intake levels. With this guidance, which included an updated intake level for N-nitroso-varenicline, we have started making regulatory submissions to potentially enable Chantix to return to market in the U.S. and in certain international markets. 
 Except for the impact of the tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first nine months of 2024 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We continue to monitor industry demand for certain components and raw materials and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact to product supply, including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Voluntary Withdrawal of Oxbryta See the Product Developments section within MD A. 
 The Global Economic Environment In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook The Global Economic Environment section of the MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 COVID-19 In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the Product Developments section within MD A. 
 In 2023, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts. In September 2023, Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S., triggered by the expiration of contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets were generally under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we started transitioning to commercial markets in 2024. Due to the commercial market transition as well as the anticipated seasonality of demand for COVID-19 vaccinations, we expect approximately 60 of our 2024 global revenues for Comirnaty to be recorded in the fourth quarter. 
 In 2023, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies. On October 13, 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in November 2023, with minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024 (see Note 13C . Internationally, for Paxlovid, most markets have now transitioned to commercial markets, and we are expecting most revenue for Paxlovid to be generated through commercial channels in 2024.

 Israel/Hamas Conflict Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023. For both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the business of our Israeli subsidiary represented less than 1 of our consolidated revenues and assets. We are closely monitoring developments in this conflict, including evaluating potential impacts to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East that may impact global operations. At this time, longer term impacts to the Company are uncertain and subject to change. 
 Russia/Ukraine Conflict Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1 of our consolidated revenues and assets. While we are monitoring the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, potential additional sanctions, and actions by our customers or suppliers (including financial institutions) are difficult to predict at this time. 
 For information on risks associated with these conflicts, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors Global Operations section of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Product Revenue Deductions Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these product revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1 of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. 
 The following presents information about product revenue deductions: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (MILLIONS) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Medicare rebates 1,801 286 3,278 718 Medicaid and related state program rebates 720 406 1,846 1,228 Performance-based contract rebates 1,836 1,363 4,884 3,784 Chargebacks 3,805 2,627 9,467 7,216 Sales allowances 1,569 1,732 4,654 4,841 Sales returns and cash discounts

 10,855 6,793 25,603 18,918 
 (a) The increase in revenue deductions in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 is primarily driven by the transition of Paxlovid and Comirnaty to commercial markets, our acquisition of Seagen in December 2023, and higher sales of other recently acquired products, partially offset in the first nine months of 2024 by a 771 million favorable final adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2024 to the estimated non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal of 3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Note 13C ). 
 Product revenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume, mix of products sold, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates.

 Third Quarter of 2024 vs. Third Quarter of 2023 and First Nine Months of 2024 vs. First Nine Months of 2023 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales decreased 4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to: 
 the non-recurrence of a non-cash charge of 5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for inventory write-offs and related charges 4.7 billion for Paxlovid and 0.9 billion for Comirnaty), 
 partially offset by: 
 an unfavorable change in sales mix of 1.5 billion, primarily driven by higher sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty, including a charge for the 50 gross profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses; and 
 an impact of 490 million from our Seagen acquisition, inclusive of the amortization of the fair value step-up of inventory. 
 Cost of sales decreased 5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to: 
 the non-recurrence of the aforementioned non-cash charge of 5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023; and 
 a favorable change in sales mix of 845 million, primarily driven by lower sales of Comirnaty, 
 partially offset by: 
 an impact of 1.4 billion from our Seagen acquisition, inclusive of the amortization of the fair value step-up of inventory. 
 The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 reflects the non-recurrence of the aforementioned non-cash charge of 5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues and related cost of sales anticipated in the fall and winter seasons. See also Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook The Global Economic Environment COVID-19 section for information about our COVID-19 products. 
 Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, informational and administrative expenses were relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to: 
 a decrease of 210 million due to lower U.S. healthcare reform fees primarily related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty, 
 largely offset by: 
 an increase of 165 million in marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products. 
 Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased 260 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to: 
 an increase of 600 million in marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products, 
 partially offset by: 
 a decrease of 310 million for marketing and promotional expenses for Paxlovid. 
 46 

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses decreased 113 million in the third quarter and 77 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to: 
 lower spending of 430 million in the third quarter and 930 million in the first nine months related to certain ongoing vaccine programs and as a result of our cost realignment program, 
 partially offset by: 
 a net increase in spending of 310 million in the third quarter and 850 million in the first nine months mainly to develop certain product candidates acquired from Seagen. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets increased 133 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 461 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by: 
 increases of 140 million in the third quarter and 400 million in the first nine months from our December 2023 acquisition of Seagen; and 
 increases of 120 million in the third quarter and 360 million in the first nine months related to assets reclassified in 2023 from IPR D to developed technology rights, 
 partially offset by: 
 decreases of 130 million in the third quarter and 350 million in the first nine months related to changes in asset lives and fully amortized assets. 
 Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives 
 Realigning our Cost Base Program This program is expected to deliver net cost savings of at least 4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2024. 
 Manufacturing Optimization Program The first phase of this multi-phased program is expected to deliver savings of approximately 1.5 billion by the end of 2027, some of which is expected to begin being realized in 2025. 
 Certain qualifying costs for these programs in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income/(Loss). See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income /(Loss) section within MD A. 
 For a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see Note 3A . The program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity expiries as well as the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. Improvement of operating margin will continue to be an important focus for the Company. 
 Seagen acquisition In connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately 1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by 2026. The one-time costs to generate these synergies are expected to be approximately 1.5 billion, incurred primarily from 2023 through 2025. 
 Other (Income)/Deductions Net 
 The unfavorable period-over-period changes of 62 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by higher net interest expense and a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to the expected sale of one of our facilities resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program, partially offset by net gains on equity securities in 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in 2023. See Note 4 .

 Changes in Tax Laws Many countries outside the U.S. have enacted legislation for global minimum taxation resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar 2 project. The EU has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate the OECD provisions into their respective domestic laws, and countries outside the EU are also enacting the provisions into their domestic law. The provisions are generally effective for Pfizer in 2024, though significant details and guidance around the provisions are still pending. Income tax expense could be adversely affected as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, and such impact could be material to our results of operations. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries.

 The late stage development flu program has been removed from the table above as it represented the first-generation quadrivalent candidate. Pfizer is developing second-generation candidates with the goal of improving immunogenicity and potentially breadth of protection, including new trivalent formulations that match updated recommendations by the World Health Organization and the FDA s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. These candidates are currently in Phase 2. Pfizer will continue to evaluate its influenza vaccine program and discuss next steps with health authorities. 
 In August 2024, Pfizer announced Phase 3 top-line results for Pfizer and BioNTech s combination mRNA vaccine candidate against influenza and COVID-19 in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The trial did not meet one of its primary immunogenicity objectives of non-inferiority against the influenza B strain despite obtaining higher influenza A responses and comparable COVID-19 responses versus the comparator vaccines. The companies are evaluating adjustments to the candidate and are discussing next steps with health authorities. 
 In September 2024, Pfizer announced that it is voluntarily withdrawing all lots of Oxbryta (voxelotor) for the treatment of sickle cell disease in all markets where it is approved. Pfizer is also discontinuing all active voxelotor clinical trials and expanded access programs worldwide. Pfizer s decision is based on the totality of clinical data that now indicates the overall benefit of Oxbryta no longer outweighs the risk in the approved sickle cell patient population. The data suggest an imbalance in vaso-occlusive crises and fatal events, which requires further assessment. Pfizer has notified regulatory authorities about these findings and its decision to voluntarily withdraw Oxbryta from the market and discontinue distribution and clinical studies while further reviewing the available data and investigating the findings. 
 In July 2024, the EMA initiated a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Oxbryta (voxelotor) to review the product s benefits and risks. In October, the EC suspended the Oxbryta marketing authorization while the EMA s review of data is ongoing. In addition, the FDA has initiated an evaluation of newly identified safety signals. The FDA also has placed the Oxbryta (voxelotor) investigational new drug application on clinical hold following Pfizer s market withdrawal. Pfizer is working with the EMA, FDA, and other regulators globally in relation to this matter.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME/(LOSS) 
 Adjusted income/(loss) is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income/(loss), certain components of Adjusted income/(loss) and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) to present the results of our major operations the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows: 
 Measure Definition Relevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance Adjusted income/(loss) Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders (a) before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items 
 Provides investors useful information to: 
 evaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their components, on a comparable year-over-year basis 
 assist in modeling expected future performance on a normalized basis 
 Provides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management (b) 
 Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions net 
 Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Other (income)/deductions net (a) , each before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are components of the Adjusted income/(loss) measure 
 Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) EPS/(LPS) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders diluted (a) before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items 
 
 (a) Most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 51 

(b) The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which is derived from Adjusted income/(loss) and accounts for 40 of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income/(loss), which is derived from Adjusted income/(loss). Since 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R D pipeline performance, as measured by three metrics, and performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee s assessment of other factors. 
 Adjusted income/(loss) and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS/(LPS) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders diluted , respectively. 
 We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans. 
 Adjusted Income/(Loss) and Adjusted Diluted EPS/(LPS) 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets Adjusted income/(loss) excludes all amortization of intangible assets. 
 Acquisition-Related Items Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. 
 Discontinued Operations Adjusted income/(loss) excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income/(loss) measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods. 
 Certain Significant Items Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosimilar entry or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items and the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K.

ANALYSIS OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 
 Nine Months Ended (MILLIONS) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Drivers of change Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities 6,023 3,460 The change was primarily driven by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business (which includes a decrease in deferred revenue driven by utilization of the U.S. government volume-based credit for Paxlovid), partially offset by a decrease from net income adjusted for non-cash items. 
 Investing activities 4,275 (21,282) The change was driven mainly by 19.5 billion greater net redemptions of short-term investments in 2024, 3.5 billion of proceeds from the partial sale of the Haleon investment in 2024, as well as 1.4 billion greater proceeds from the sale of long-term investments including 1.2 billion in proceeds from our investment in Cerevel. 
 Financing activities (12,026) 20,624 The change was driven mainly by 30.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2023 as well as 2.1 billion greater repayments of commercial paper in 2024. 

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK 
 Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue over time, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We expect operating cash flows to be below typical levels this year largely due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses. Additionally, with an anticipated heavy weighting of revenue to the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the expected seasonality of certain products in our portfolio, a potentially higher level of cash collections may carry over into the first quarter of 2025. We continue to believe that with our ongoing operating cash flows, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows , Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity , and the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows section within MD A. For information on our money market funds, available-for sale-debt securities and long-term debt, see Note 7 . 
 For information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions and market risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD A of our 2023 Form 10-K. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12B . 
 Credit Ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S P and Moody s. 
 As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the following ratings have been assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt: 
 NAME OF RATING AGENCY Pfizer Short-Term Rating Pfizer Long-Term Rating Outlook/Watch Moody s P-1 A2 
 Stable Outlook 
 S P A-1 A 
 Stable Outlook 
 
 These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organizations. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 Debt Capacity Lines of Credit As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had access to a total of 15 billion in committed U.S. revolving credit facilities, consisting of an 8.0 billion facility maturing in October 2025 and a 7.0 billion facility maturing in October 2029, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our global commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facilities, our lenders have provided us an additional 
 55 

281 million in lines of credit, of which 246 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. 
 Capital Allocation Framework Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars: maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in the business and making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. In October 2024, our BOD declared a dividend of 0.42 per share, payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, our remaining share-purchase authorization was 3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first nine months of 2024. See Note 12 in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on our publicly announced share-purchase plans. 
 In March 2024, we sold a portion of our investment in Haleon for 3.5 billion reducing our ownership interest from 32 to approximately 23 (see Note 2B ). In the fourth quarter of 2024, we sold an additional portion of our investment in Haleon for 3.5 billion further reducing our ownership interest to approximately 15 . Pfizer intends to use the proceeds to support its capital allocation priorities. With the reduction of our Haleon ownership percentage, we will no longer apply the equity method to our investment in Haleon. We expect to begin accounting for our remaining investment in Haleon as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, which is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions net . We intend to continue to monetize our remaining 15 stake in Haleon in a disciplined fashion, with an objective of maximizing value for Pfizer shareholders.
