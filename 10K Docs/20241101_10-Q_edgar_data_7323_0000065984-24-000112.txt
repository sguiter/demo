 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 
 In this combined report and from time to time, Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries each makes statements as a registrant concerning its expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, projections, strategies, and future events or performance. Such statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as may, will, could, project, believe, anticipate, intend, goal, commitment, expect, estimate, continue, potential, plan, predict, forecast, and other similar words or expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the only means to identify these statements. Although each of these registrants believes that these forward-looking statements and the underlying assumptions are reasonable, it cannot provide assurance that they will prove correct. Any forward-looking statement is based on information current as of the date of this combined report and speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, each registrant undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. There are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including (a) those factors discussed or incorporated by reference in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K and in this report, (b) those factors discussed or incorporated by reference in Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis in the Form 10-K and in this report, and (c) the following factors (in addition to others described elsewhere in this combined report and in subsequent securities filings): 
 
 resolution of pending and future rate cases and related litigation, formula rate proceedings and related negotiations, including various performance-based rate discussions, Entergy s utility supply plan, and recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, as well as delays in cost recovery resulting from these proceedings; 
 regulatory and operating challenges and uncertainties and economic risks associated with the Utility operating companies participation in MISO, including the benefits of continued MISO participation, the effect of current or projected MISO market rules, market design and market and system conditions in the MISO markets, the absence of a minimum capacity obligation for load serving entities in MISO and the consequent ability of some load serving entities to free ride on the energy market without paying appropriate compensation for the capacity needed to produce that energy, the allocation of MISO system transmission upgrade costs, delays in developing or interconnecting new generation or other resources or other adverse effects arising from the volume of requests in the MISO transmission interconnection queue, the MISO-wide base rate of return on equity allowed or any MISO-related charges and credits required by the FERC, and the effect of planning decisions that MISO makes with respect to future transmission investments by the Utility operating companies; 
 changes in utility regulation, including, with respect to retail and wholesale competition, the ability to recover net utility assets and other potential stranded costs, including those capital investments associated with unrealized customer growth expectations, and the application of more stringent return on equity criteria, transmission reliability requirements, or market power criteria by the FERC or the U.S. Department of Justice; 
 changes in the regulation or regulatory oversight of Entergy s owned or operated nuclear generating facilities, nuclear materials and fuel, and the effects of new or existing safety or environmental concerns regarding nuclear power plants and fuel; 
 resolution of pending or future applications, and related regulatory proceedings and litigation, for license modifications or other authorizations required of nuclear generating facilities and the effect of public and political opposition on these applications, regulatory proceedings, and litigation; 
 the performance of and deliverability of power from Entergy s generation resources, including the capacity factors at Entergy s nuclear generating facilities;

 variations in weather and the occurrence of hurricanes and other storms and disasters, including uncertainties associated with efforts to remediate the effects of hurricanes, ice storms, wildfires, or other weather events and the recovery of costs associated with restoration, including the ability to access funded storm reserves, federal and local cost recovery mechanisms, securitization, and insurance, as well as any related unplanned outages; 
 effects of climate change, including the potential for increases in extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heat waves, drought or wildfires, and sea levels or coastal land and wetland loss; 
 the risk that an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. could lead to the assessment of significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of Entergy s participation in a secondary financial protection system and a utility industry mutual insurance company; 
 changes in the quality and availability of water supplies and the related regulation of water use and diversion; 
 Entergy s ability to manage its capital projects, including any capital projects to serve the growing demand for electricity driven in part by the development of large data centers, and to complete such capital projects timely and within budget, to obtain the anticipated performance or other benefits of such capital projects, and to manage its capital and operation and maintenance costs;

Operating Revenues 
 
 Utility 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 3,559 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (51) Volume/weather (118) Retail one-time bill credit (92) Retail electric price 72 2024 operating revenues 3,370 
 
 The Utility operating companies results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by an increase in industrial usage. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the petroleum refining and chlor-alkali industries. 
 
 The retail one-time bill credit represents the disbursement of settlement proceeds in the form of a one-time bill credit provided to Entergy Arkansas s retail customers during the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. There is no effect on net income because Entergy Arkansas previously recorded a regulatory liability for the effects of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K f or discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of Entergy Arkansas s Grand Gulf credit rider. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 
 
 an increase in Entergy Arkansas s formula rate plan rates effective January 2024; 
 increases in Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan revenues, including increases in the distribution and transmission recovery mechanisms, effective September 2023 and September 2024; and 
 increases in Entergy Mississippi s formula rate plan rates effective April 2024 and July 2024. 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the regulatory proceedings discussed above.

 Total electric energy sales for Utility for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 
 2024 2023 Change (GWh) Residential 11,519 12,661 (9) Commercial 8,394 8,648 (3) Industrial 15,150 13,781 10 Governmental 684 700 (2) Total retail 35,747 35,790 Sales for resale 3,727 3,916 (5) Total 39,474 39,706 (1) 
 
 See Note 12 to the financial statements herein for additional discussion of operating revenues. 
 
 Other Income Statement Items 
 
 Utility 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from 743 million for the third quarter 2023 to 714 million for the third quarter 2024 primarily due to a decrease of 20 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to the timing of vegetation maintenance costs and a decrease of 10 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation accruals in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges (credits) includes the effects of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. In third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded write-offs of its regulatory asset for deferred fuel of 68.9 million and the undepreciated balance of 9.5 million in capital costs related to the ANO stator incident. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense of 41 million in 2023 at System Energy as a result of the approval by the FERC in August 2023 of the settlement establishing updated depreciation rates used in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and additions to plant in service. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Unit Power Sales Agreement depreciation amendment proceeding. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes: 
 
 the reversal in third quarter 2024 of a 92 million regulatory liability recognized for Entergy Arkansas s obligation to return to customers the refund from the System Energy settlement with the APSC. This reversal of the regulatory liability offsets a reduction in gross revenues from the retail one-time bill credits provided to customers in the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of Entergy Arkansas s Grand Gulf credit rider; and 
 the reversal in third quarter 2023 of 22 million of regulatory liabilities to reflect the recognition of certain receipts by Entergy Texas under affiliated PPAs that have been resolved. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of Entergy Texas s 2022 base rate case.

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In addition, Entergy records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to: 
 
 a decrease of 19 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in third quarter 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; 
 changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of decommissioning trust funds in third quarter 2024; and 
 an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project at Entergy Texas. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to: 
 
 the issuance by Entergy Arkansas of 300 million of 5.30 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023; 
 the issuances by Entergy Arkansas of 400 million of 5.75 Series mortgage bonds and 400 million of 5.45 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024; 
 the issuances by Entergy Louisiana of 500 million of 5.35 Series mortgage bonds and 700 million of 5.70 Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2024; 
 the issuance by Entergy Louisiana of 700 million of 5.15 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024; 
 the issuance by Entergy Mississippi of 300 million of 5.85 Series mortgage bonds in May 2024; 
 the issuance by Entergy Texas of 350 million of 5.80 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023; and 
 the issuance by Entergy Texas of 350 million of 5.55 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the repayment by Entergy Arkansas of 375 million of 3.70 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024; 
 the repayment by Entergy Louisiana of 325 million of 4.05 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023; 
 the repayment by Entergy Louisiana of 300 million of 5.59 Series mortgage bonds in December 2023; and 
 the repayment by Entergy Louisiana of 400 million of 5.40 Series mortgage bonds in April 2024. 
 
 Parent and Other 
 
 Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges (credits) includes the effects of recording a favorable final judgment of 40 million in third quarter 2023 to resolve claims in the Indian Point 2 fourth round and Indian Point 3 third round combined damages case against the DOE. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation. 
 
 Other income (deductions) decreased primarily due to higher legal provisions and lower non-service pension income. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs.

 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 1.2 billion of junior subordinated debentures in May 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 25 for the third quarter 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, partially offset by the resolution of an Arkansas state income tax audit. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Arkansas state income tax audit resolution. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 25.3 for the third quarter 2023. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes.

 Operating Revenues 
 
 Utility 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 9,326 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (257) Retail one-time bill credit (92) Storm restoration carrying costs (31) Volume/weather (20) Retail electric price 158 2024 operating revenues 9,084 
 
 The Utility operating companies results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.

Storm restoration carrying costs represent the equity component of storm restoration carrying costs recognized by Entergy Louisiana as part of its March 2023 storm cost securitization. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Louisiana March 2023 storm cost securitization. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by an increase in industrial usage. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the petroleum refining industry and from new customers in the technology industry. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 
 
 an increase in Entergy Arkansas s formula rate plan rates effective January 2024; 
 increases in Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan revenues, including increases in the distribution and transmission recovery mechanisms, effective September 2023 and September 2024; 
 increases in Entergy Mississippi s formula rate plan rates effective April 2024 and July 2024; and 
 an increase in Entergy Texas s base rates effective June 2023, partially offset by the implementation of the generation cost recovery relate-back rider for the Hardin County Peaking Facility effective over three months beginning in May 2023.

See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding; and 
 the effects of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. In third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded write-offs of its regulatory asset for deferred fuel of 68.9 million and the undepreciated balance of 9.5 million in capital costs related to the ANO stator incident. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 additions to plant in service; 
 the recognition of 28 million in depreciation expense in 2024 at Entergy Texas for the 2022 base rate case relate back period, effective over six months beginning January 2024. The recognition of depreciation expense for the relate back period is effective over the same period as collections from the relate back surcharge rider and results in no effect on net income; 
 a reduction in depreciation expense of 41 million in 2023 at System Energy as a result of the approval by the FERC in August 2023 of the settlement establishing updated depreciation rates used in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses under the Unit Power Sales Agreement; and 
 an increase in depreciation rates at Entergy Texas, effective June 2023. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation rates at System Energy effective June 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Unit Power Sales Agreement depreciation amendment proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2022 base rate case at Entergy Texas. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes: 
 
 the reversal in third quarter 2024 of a 92 million regulatory liability recognized for Entergy Arkansas s obligation to return to customers the refund from the System Energy settlement with the APSC. This reversal of the regulatory liability offsets a reduction in gross revenues from the retail one-time bill credits provided to customers in the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider.

 regulatory charges of 150 million, recorded by Entergy Louisiana in second quarter 2024, to reflect the effects of an agreement in principle between Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff and the intervenors in July 2024 to renew Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan and resolve a number of other retail dockets and matters, including all formula rate plan test years prior to 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Entergy Louisiana agreement in principle and the subsequently filed global stipulated settlement agreement; 
 a regulatory charge of 103 million, recorded by Entergy Louisiana in first quarter 2023, to reflect its obligation to provide credits to its customers as described in an LPSC ancillary order issued in the Hurricane Ida securitization regulatory proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Louisiana March 2023 storm cost securitization; 
 a regulatory charge of 78 million, recorded by Entergy New Orleans in first quarter 2024, primarily to reflect a settlement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council in April 2024 for additional sharing with customers of income tax benefits from the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the April 2024 settlement in principle and Note 3 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit; and 
 the reversal in third quarter 2023 of 22 million of regulatory liabilities to reflect the recognition of certain receipts by Entergy Texas under affiliated PPAs that have been resolved. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of Entergy Texas s 2022 base rate case. 
 
 In addition, Entergy records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to: 
 
 changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of decommissioning trust funds in 2024; 
 a decrease of 45 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; 
 an increase of 18 million in intercompany dividend income from affiliated preferred membership interests related to storm cost securitizations. The intercompany dividend income on the affiliate preferred membership interests is eliminated for consolidation purposes and has no effect on net income since the investment is in another Entergy subsidiary; 
 an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project at Entergy Texas; and 
 a 15 million charge, recorded by Entergy Louisiana in first quarter 2023, for the LURC s 1 beneficial interest in the storm trust II established as part of the March 2023 storm cost securitization. See Note 2 to the financial stateme nts in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Louisiana March 2023 storm cost securitization.

Interest expense increased primarily due to: 
 
 the issuance by Entergy Arkansas of 300 million of 5.30 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023; 
 the issuances by Entergy Arkansas of 400 million of 5.75 Series mortgage bonds and 400 million of 5.45 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024; 
 the issuances by Entergy Louisiana of 500 million of 5.35 Series mortgage bonds and 700 million of 5.70 Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2024; 
 the issuance by Entergy Louisiana of 700 million of 5.15 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024; 
 the issuance by Entergy Mississippi of 300 million of 5.85 Series mortgage bonds in May 2024; and 
 the issuance by Entergy Texas of 350 million of 5.80 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the repayment by Entergy Arkansas of 250 million of 3.05 Series mortgage bonds in June 2023; 
 the repayment by Entergy Arkansas of 375 million of 3.70 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024;

 the repayment by Entergy Louisiana of 300 million of 5.59 Series mortgage bonds in December 2023; and 
 the repayment by Entergy Louisiana of 400 million of 5.40 Series mortgage bonds in April 2024. 
 
 Parent and Other 
 
 Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges (credits) includes the effects of recording a favorable final judgment of 40 million in third quarter 2023 to resolve claims in the Indian Point 2 fourth round and Indian Point 3 third round combined damages case against the DOE. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation. 
 
 Other income (deductions) decreased primarily due to: 
 
 a 317 million 250 million net-of-tax) non-cash settlement charge recognized as a result of a group annuity contract purchased in May 2024 to settle certain pension liabilities. See Note 6 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the group annuity contract and settlement charge; 
 the elimination for consolidation purposes of intercompany dividend income of 18 million from affiliated preferred membership interests, as discussed above; 
 lower non-service pension income. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; and 
 higher legal provisions. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to higher commercial paper balances and the issuance of 1.2 billion of junior subordinated debentures in May 2024. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein for discussion of Entergy s commercial paper program. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 25.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of tax rate changes, and a provision for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the resolution of an Arkansas state income tax audit, certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, and book and tax

 differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Arkansas state income tax audit resolution. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 17.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the reduction in income tax expense as a result of the securitization of Hurricane Ida storm costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana Legislature s Regular Session of 2021, and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, partially offset by the accrual for state income taxes. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the Entergy Louisiana March 2023 storm cost securitization under Act 293. 

Income Tax Legislation and Regulation 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Income Tax Legislation and Regulation in the Form 10-K for discussion of income tax legislation and regulation. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy have the potential to generate zero-emission nuclear power production tax credits for electricity generated by their respective nuclear power facilities. Based on guidance provided by the United States Treasury Department and the IRS, the nuclear production tax credits will be calculated by multiplying the kWh of qualifying electricity by 0.003, with the value of the credits decreasing ratably, or phasing out, once the annual gross receipts from the sale of nuclear power exceed a certain threshold. If certain prevailing wage requirements are satisfied, the calculation of the credit, as described in the preceding sentence, is multiplied by a factor of five. Additional guidance is needed from the United States Treasury Department and/or the IRS to determine how the value of these credits will be calculated for power generated from nuclear facilities of rate-regulated utilities. Due to the uncertainty of value, if any, of credits Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy may receive, such credits have not been recognized for the nuclear power produced through the third quarter of 2024. If credits are recognized in future periods, the value of such credits is expected to be provided to customers. As such, recognition of nuclear production tax credits is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy. 
 
 Entergy Arkansas has accrued solar production tax credits associated with the beginning of commercial operations of the Walnut Bend Solar facility in September 2024. As the value of such credits is expected to be provided to customers, a regulatory liability has been recorded for all credits recognized in the third quarter of 2024. As such, recognition of solar production tax credits is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of Entergy or Entergy Arkansas.

described therein as being in the public interest and proposing certain conditions. In August 2024 the LPSC issued an order accepting the LPSC staff s report and recommendation. 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in December 2023, Entergy New Orleans and the buyer of Entergy New Orleans s gas distribution business filed their joint application with the City Council seeking approval for the proposed transaction. In September 2024 the hearing officer certified the record of the proceeding for City Council consideration. A decision is targeted for first quarter 2025. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Form 10-K for a discussion of Entergy s capital structure, capital spending plans and other uses of capital, and sources of capital. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Capital Structure and Resources 
 
 Entergy s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 65.4 63.8 Effect of excluding securitization bonds (0.1 (0.3 Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 65.3 63.5 Effect of subtracting cash (1.2 (0.1 Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 64.1 63.4 
 
 (a) Calculation excludes the New Orleans and Texas securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Texas, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 21.7 of the debt outstanding is at the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and 77.8 is at the Utility. The remaining 0.5 of the debt outstanding relates to the Vermont Yankee credit facility, as discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements herein. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and commercial paper, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, equity, and subsidiaries preferred stock without sinking fund. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures. Entergy uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K. Entergy also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 
 Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of 3 billion and expires in June 2029. The facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against 20 million of the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The commitment fee is currently 0.225 of the undrawn commitment amount. Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The estimated interest rate as of September 30, 2024

 that would have been applied to outstanding borrowings under the facility was 6.45 . The following is a summary of the amounts outstanding and capacity available under the credit facility as of September 30, 2024: 
 Capacity Borrowings Letters of Credit Capacity Available (In Millions) 3,000 4 2,996 
 
 Entergy Corporation s credit facility includes a covenant requiring Entergy to maintain a consolidated debt ratio, as defined, of 65 or less of its total capitalization. The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy Corporation s credit facility is different than the calculation of the debt to capital ratio above. Entergy is currently in compliance with the covenant and expects to remain in compliance with this covenant. If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy Corporation or one of the Registrant Subsidiaries (except Entergy New Orleans and System Energy) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the Entergy Corporation credit facility s maturity date may occur. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein for additional discussion of the Entergy Corporation credit facility and discussion of the Registrant Subsidiaries credit facilities. 
 
 Entergy Corporation has a commercial paper program with a Board-approved program limit of 2 billion. As of September 30, 2024, Entergy Corporation had 1,122.4 million of commercial paper outstanding. The weighted-average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.64 . 
 
 Equity Issuances and Equity Distribution Program 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Capital - Equity Issuances and Equity Distribution Program in the Form 10-K and Note 3 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the equity distribution program. The following is an update to that discussion. 
 
 Entergy Corporation currently expects to issue approximately 4.4 billion of equity through 2028, which it may issue under its at the market equity distribution program or otherwise, with approximately 1.4 billion already contracted under forward sale agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Entergy Corporation Two-For-One Forward Stock Split 
 
 In October 2024, Entergy announced a two-for-one forward stock split of Entergy Corporation s issued common stock. The split will be effected through an amendment to Entergy Corporation s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, December 5, 2024, will receive one additional share of common stock for each then-held share, to be distributed after market close on December 12, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Friday, December 13, 2024. 
 
 Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital 
 
 See the table and discussion in the Form 10-K under MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital , that sets forth the amounts of Entergy s planned construction and other capital investments for 2025 through 2027. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Entergy is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates that the Utility will make approximately 25 billion in capital investments during that period. In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the preliminary Utility estimate includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy s portfolio, as well as to support customer growth, including Bayou

Power Station, Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, Orange County Advanced Power Station, Lone Star Power Station, Segno Solar, Votaw Solar, and potential construction of additional generation; investments in the Utility s nuclear fleet; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience through projects focused on asset renewals and enhancements and grid stability; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of business restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 
 
 Renewables 
 
 Walnut Bend Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 100 MW Walnut Bend Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest. Entergy Arkansas primarily requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. Acquisition of the Walnut Bend Solar facility was initially approved by the APSC in July 2021. The agreement was amended by the parties in February 2023, and the revised agreement was approved by the APSC in July 2023. In February 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 169.7 million to acquire the facility. Substantial completion was achieved and commercial operation commenced in September 2024, at which time Entergy Arkansas made a substantial completion payment of approximately 15.8 million for acquisition of the facility. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the purchase of the Walnut Bend Solar facility. 
 
 West Memphis Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in January 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 180 MW West Memphis Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest. In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility, to be sited on approximately 1,500 acres in Crittenden County, Arkansas. Acquisition of the West Memphis Solar facility was initially approved by the APSC in October 2021. In March 2022 the counterparty to the build-own-transfer agreement notified Entergy Arkansas that it was seeking changes to certain terms of the agreement, including both cost and schedule. Entergy Arkansas filed a supplemental application with the APSC in January 2023 for a change in the transmission route and updates to the cost and schedule, which was approved by the APSC in March 2023. In August 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 48.4 million to acquire the facility. The project will commence commercial operation once testing is completed and the project has achieved substantial completion. Entergy Arkansas expects the project to commence commercial operation in November 2024, at which time a substantial completion payment of approximately 200 million is expected. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility. 
 
 Driver Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in April 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 250 MW Driver Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest and requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In August 2022 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas s petition and approved the acquisition of Driver Solar and cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In August 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 307.7 million to acquire the facility. The project will commence commercial operation once testing is completed and the project has achieved substantial completion. Entergy Arkansas currently expects the project to commence commercial

 operation by the end of 2024, at which time a substantial completion payment of approximately 100 million is expected. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the purchase of the Driver Solar facility. 
 
 Alternative RFP and Certification 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in March 2023, Entergy Louisiana made the first phase of a bifurcated filing to seek approval from the LPSC for an alternative to the requests for proposals (RFP) process that would enable the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources on a faster timeline than the current RFP and certification process allows. The initial phase of the filing established the need for the acquisition of additional resources and the need for an alternative to the RFP process. The second phase of the filing, which contains the details of the proposal for the alternative competitive procurement process and the information necessary to support certification, was filed in May 2023. In addition to the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources, the filing also seeks approval of a new renewable energy credits-based tariff, Rider Geaux ZERO . In May 2024 the LPSC voted to approve the application, and in June 2024 the LPSC issued an order reflecting that approval. In August 2024, Entergy Louisiana issued the first RFP pursuant to this order in solicitation of solar resources that meet the requirements of the LPSC s order. 
 
 Segno Solar and Votaw Solar 
 
 In July 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Segno Solar facility, a 170 MW solar facility to be located in Polk County, Texas, and the Votaw Solar facility, a 141 MW solar facility to be located in Hardin County, Texas. The Segno Solar facility will cost an estimated 351.6 million, and the Votaw Solar facility will cost an estimated 303.8 million, in each case inclusive of estimated transmission interconnection and upgrade costs. In September 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted an agreed procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits to be held in March 2025. A PUCT decision is expected in third quarter 2025. Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, the Segno Solar facility is expected to be in service by early 2027, and the Votaw Solar facility is expected to be in service by mid-2028. 
 
 Other Generation 
 
 Bayou Power Station 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Bayou Power Station, a 112 MW aggregated capacity floating natural gas power station with black-start capability in Leeville, Louisiana and an associated microgrid that would serve nearby areas, including Port Fourchon, Golden Meadow, Leeville, and Grand Isle. In its application, Entergy Louisiana noted that the estimated cost of the Bayou Power Station was 411 million, including estimated costs of transmission interconnection and other related costs. In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed a motion to suspend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to evaluate certain recent developments related to the project including potential changes to the estimated cost of the project. Entergy Louisiana will determine next steps for the project after fully evaluating these developments. Subject to timely approval by the LPSC and receipt of other permits and approvals, commercial operation is expected to occur by the end of 2028. 
 
 Entergy Louisiana Additional Generation and Transmission Resources 
 
 In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking approval of a variety of generation and transmission resources proposed in connection with establishing service to a new customer facility in north Louisiana, for which an electric service agreement has been executed. The filing requests LPSC certification of three new combined cycle combustion turbine generation resources totaling 2,262 MW, each of which will be

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

enabled for future carbon capture and storage, a new 500 kV transmission line, and 500 kV substation upgrades. The application also requests approval to implement a corporate sustainability rider applicable to the new customer. The corporate sustainability rider contemplates the new customer contributing to the costs of the future addition of 1,500 MW of new solar and energy storage resources, agreements involving carbon capture and storage at Entergy Louisiana s existing Lake Charles Power Station, and potential future wind and nuclear resources. The combined cost of the first two new generation resources is estimated to be approximately 2,387 million, and these units are expected to achieve commercial operation in 2028. The third new generation resource is currently expected to have an estimated cost similar to the first two new generation resources and is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2029. The cost of the new 500 kV transmission line is estimated to be 546 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates funding the incremental cost to serve the customer through direct financial contributions from the customer and the revenues it expects to earn under the electric service agreement. The application requests an LPSC decision by September 2025 in order to support the customer s schedule for taking electric service for the new facility. 
 
 Delta Blues Advanced Power Station 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Mississippi announced plans to construct, own, and operate the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, to be located in Washington County, Mississippi. The facility will primarily be powered by natural gas, and it will also be enabled with carbon capture and hydrogen co-firing optionality. The Delta Blues Advanced Power Station will cost an estimated 1.2 billion. State legislation passed in January 2024 provides for the pre-certification of construction for certain types of facilities that directly or indirectly provide electric service to customers with defined projects under the legislation. Construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station qualifies under this legislation for pre-certification. As enabled by this legislation, Entergy Mississippi began recovery of certain costs of construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station through the interim facilities rate adjustments provision of its formula rate plan rider, which rates became effective in July 2024. Non-fuel revenue collected from the facility s customer will be included in the formula rate plan to offset the facility s revenue requirement. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be in service by 2028. 
 
 Legend Power Station and Lone Star Power Station 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Legend Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled with both carbon capture and storage and hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Jefferson County, Texas, and the Lone Star Power Station, a 453 MW simple-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled with hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Liberty County, Texas. In its application, Entergy Texas noted that the Legend Power Station was expected to cost an estimated 1.46 billion and the Lone Star Power Station was expected to cost an estimated 735.3 million, in each case inclusive of the estimated costs of the generation facilities, interconnection costs, transmission network upgrades, and an allowance for funds used during construction. As described in the application, Entergy Texas is considering alternative financing approaches for the Legend Power Station and plans to pursue the financing option that is in the best interest of its customers. In July 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and, also in July 2024, the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled to begin in October 2024. In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed, and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted, a motion to extend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to address certain developments relating to the cost and scope of the Legend Power Station and the Lone Star Power Station. As soon as the required information is developed, Entergy Texas plans to update the economic analyses in the application for both projects and to file a proposed updated procedural schedule. Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, both facilities are expected to be in service by mid-2028.

 Entergy Louisiana 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in December 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking a public interest finding regarding Phase I of Entergy Louisiana s Future Ready resilience plan and approval of a rider mechanism to recover the program s costs. Phase I in the December 2022 application reflected the first five years of a ten-year resilience plan and included investment of approximately 5 billion, including hardening investment, transmission dead-end structures, enhanced vegetation management, and telecommunications improvement. In April 2024 the LPSC approved a framework which includes an initial five-year resilience plan providing for an investment of approximately 1.9 billion with cost recovery via a forward-looking rider with semi-annual true-ups. The plan is subject to specified reporting requirements and includes a performance review of the hardened assets. The LPSC order approving the framework does not include any restrictions on Entergy Louisiana s ability to file applications for approval of additional investments in resilience. 
 
 Entergy New Orleans 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2021 the City Council passed a resolution and order establishing a docket and procedural schedule with respect to system resiliency and storm hardening. In July 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council a response identifying a preliminary plan for storm hardening and resiliency projects, including microgrids, to be implemented over ten years at an approximate cost of 1.5 billion. In February 2023 the City Council approved a revised procedural schedule requiring Entergy New Orleans to make a filing in April 2023 containing a narrowed list of proposed hardening projects. In April 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed the required application and supporting testimony seeking City Council approval of the first phase (five years and 559 million) of a ten-year infrastructure hardening plan totaling approximately 1 billion. Entergy New Orleans also sought, among other relief, City Council approval of a rider to recover from customers the costs of the infrastructure hardening plan. In February 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to implement a resilience project to be partially funded by 55 million of matching funding through the DOE s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program. The resolution also required Entergy New Orleans to submit, no later than July 2024, a revised resilience plan consisting of projects over a three-year period. In March 2024, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council for approval the requested three-year resilience plan, which includes 168 million in hardening projects. The three-year resilience plan is in addition to the previously authorized resilience project to be partially funded by the DOE s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program. In July 2024 the City Council held a technical conference regarding Entergy New Orleans s three-year resilience plan. In October 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing a two-year resilience plan totaling 100 million. The resolution directs Entergy New Orleans to notify the City Council of the subset of hardening projects from the revised three-year resilience plan to be included in the two-year resilience plan. 
 
 Entergy Texas 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT requesting approval of Phase I of its Texas Future Ready Resiliency Plan, a cost-effective set of measures to begin accelerating the resiliency of Entergy Texas s transmission and distribution system. Phase I is comprised of projects totaling approximately 335.1 million, including approximately 198 million of projects contingent upon Entergy Texas s receipt of grant funds in that amount from the Texas Energy Fund. The projects in Phase I include distribution and transmission hardening and modernization projects and targeted vegetation management projects to mitigate the risk of wildfire. These projects are expected to be implemented within approximately three years of PUCT approval. The PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings in June 2024. In July 2024, Entergy Texas filed a motion, on behalf of the parties to the proceeding, requesting the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopt an agreed proposed procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled for September 2024. The ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted the agreed procedural schedule in August 2024. In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed, on behalf of the parties to the proceeding, and the ALJ with the

State Office of Administrative Hearings granted, an unopposed motion to abate the procedural schedule, including the hearing on the merits, noting the parties had reached a settlement in principle and to allow the parties time to finalize a settlement agreement. In October 2024, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement that would resolve all issues in the proceeding, supporting testimony, and a motion to admit evidence and remand the proceeding to the PUCT. Also in October 2024, the PUCT staff filed testimony in support of the unopposed settlement. A PUCT decision is expected in fourth quarter 2024. 
 
 Hurricane Francine 
 
 In September 2024, Hurricane Francine caused damage to the areas served by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, primarily due to damage to distribution infrastructure as a result of strong winds and heavy rain, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Francine are currently estimated to be in the range of 220 million to 240 million. Entergy is considering all available avenues to recover storm-related costs from Hurricane Francine, including accessing funded storm reserve escrows. Storm cost recovery or financing will be subject to review by applicable regulatory authorities. 
 
 Based on the historic treatment of such costs for similar storm events in the areas served by Entergy, management believes that recovery of restoration costs is probable. There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because Entergy has not gone through the regulatory processes regarding these storm costs; however, there is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing of such recovery. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Declarations of dividends on Entergy s common stock are made at the discretion of the Board. Among other things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy s common stock dividends based upon earnings per share from the Utility segment and the Parent and Other portion of the business, financial strength, and future investment opportunities. At its October 2024 meeting, the Board declared a dividend of 1.20 per share. 
 
 Cash Flow Activity 
 
 As shown in Entergy s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 2024 2023 (In Millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 133 224 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 3,109 3,231 Investing activities (4,002) (3,579) Financing activities 2,172 1,644 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 1,279 1,296 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 1,412 1,520

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 122 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 lower collections from Utility customers, including the effect of higher deferred fuel collections in 2023; 
 the timing of payments to vendors; 
 an increase of 110 million in interest paid; 
 one-time bill credits of 92 million in third quarter 2024 to Entergy Arkansas s retail customers through the Grand Gulf credit rider as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement agreement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of Entergy Arkansas s Grand Gulf credit rider; and 
 57 million in proceeds received in 2023 from the DOE resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously expensed. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation. 
 
 The decrease was offset by a decrease of 103 million in pension contributions resulting from the timing of contributions in 2024 compared to 2023 and lower fuel and purchased power costs. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities increased 423 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 the initial payment of approximately 308 million in August 2024 for the purchase of the Driver Solar facility by Entergy Arkansas; 
 the initial and substantial completion payments totaling approximately 186 million in 2024 for the purchase of the Walnut Bend Solar facility by Entergy Arkansas; 
 an increase of 115 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in the Utility service area and increased spending on various transmission projects in 2024, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024; and 
 the initial payment of approximately 48 million in August 2024 for the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility by Entergy Arkansas. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 a decrease of 121 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to decreased spending on various nuclear projects in 2024; 
 a decrease of 63 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024, partially offset by increased investment in the resilience of the Utility distribution system; and 
 the substantial completion payment of approximately 30 million in April 2023 for the purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility by the Entergy Mississippi tax equity partnership. 
 
 See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Driver Solar facility, the Walnut Bend Solar facility, and the West Memphis Solar facility purchases. See Note 14 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase.

Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased 528 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to long-term debt activity providing approximately 2,742 million of cash in 2024 compared to providing approximately 221 million of cash in 2023 and an increase of 91 million in proceeds received from treasury stock issuances in 2024 due to a larger amount of previously repurchased Entergy Corporation common stock issued in 2024 to satisfy stock option exercises. The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 proceeds from securitization of 1.5 billion received by the storm trust II at Entergy Louisiana in 2023; 
 net repayments of 16 million of commercial paper in 2024 as compared to net issuances of 523 million of commercial paper in 2023; and 
 an increase of 45 million in common stock dividends paid in 2024 as a result of an increase in the dividend paid per share in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the Entergy Louisiana March 2023 storm cost securitization. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein and Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for details of Entergy s commercial paper program and long-term debt.

Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments in the Form 10-K for a discussion of market and credit risk sensitive instruments. The following is an update to that discussion. 
 
 Some of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy s non-utility operations business contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide credit support to secure its obligations under such agreement. The primary form of credit support used to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guarantee. Cash and letters of credit are also acceptable forms of credit support. At September 30, 2024, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of 6 million under the guarantees in place supporting its non-utility operations business transactions and 3 million of posted cash collateral.

 Nuclear Matters 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Nuclear Matters in the Form 10-K for a discussion of nuclear matters. The following is an update to that discussion. 
 
 NRC Reactor Oversight Process 
 
 The NRC s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: licensee response column, or Column 1, regulatory response column, or Column 2, degraded cornerstone column, or Column 3, multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column, or Column 4, and unacceptable performance, or Column 5. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5. All of the nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy s Utility business are currently in Column 1, except Waterford 3, which is in Column 2. 
 
 In August 2024 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2, effective second quarter 2024, based on exceeding the threshold for reactor scrams in June 2024. Waterford 3 will remain in Column 2 until a supplemental inspection is satisfactorily completed. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the estimates and judgments necessary in Entergy s accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs, utility regulatory accounting, taxation and uncertain tax positions, qualified pension and other postretirement benefits, and other contingencies. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of new accounting pronouncements. The following is an update to that discussion. 
 
 In March 2024 the SEC issued final rules that require registrants to provide certain climate-related disclosures in annual reports and registration statements in order to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors. The final rules require a registrant to disclose, among other things: material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks; information about the registrant s board of directors oversight of climate-related risks and management s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, the final rules require disclosure of Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a phased-in basis by certain larger registrants when those emissions are material; the filing of an attestation report covering the required disclosure of such registrants Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, also on a phased-in basis; and disclosure of the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. The phase-in compliance period is effective for Entergy beginning with its annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. In April 2024 the SEC stayed the final rules, pending judicial review of consolidated challenges to the rules by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Entergy is evaluating the impact the final rules will have on its disclosures and will continue to monitor developments related to the SEC s stay of the rules and the litigation challenging such rules.

 , Entergy Louisiana - , Entergy Mississippi - , and Entergy New Orleans - as ordered by the FERC under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In August 2024 the LPSC approved a settlement with Entergy Louisiana to globally resolve all of the LPSC s actual and potential claims in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement was filed for approval with the FERC in September 2024. The terms of the settlement include an agreement that, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, Entergy Louisiana will divest to Entergy Mississippi its share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its share of capacity and energy from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff. This divestiture will be effectuated initially through Entergy Mississippi s purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a PPA governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff. In October 2024 the proposed MSS-4 replacement PPA to effectuate this divestiture was filed for approval with the FERC. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements herein, in September 2024, Entergy Mississippi filed a notice of intent with the MPSC that relates to and seeks approval of the divestiture. Subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, divestiture will be effective, and the MSS-4 replacement PPA will commence, on January 1, 2025. If the divestiture is approved by the FERC and the MPSC, then Entergy Mississippi will also assume any and all of Entergy Louisiana s rights and obligations under the Availability Agreement and Reallocation Agreement and hold Entergy Louisiana harmless with respect thereto. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the LPSC.

 per kWh to per kWh. Due to a change in law in the State of Arkansas, the annual redetermination included million, recorded as a credit to fuel expense in first quarter 2024, for recovery attributed to net metering costs in 2023. The primary reason for the rate decrease is a large over-recovered balance as a result of lower natural gas prices in 2023. To mitigate the effect of projected increases in natural gas prices in 2024, Entergy Arkansas adjusted the over-recovered balance included in the March 2024 annual redetermination filing by million. This adjustment is expected to reduce the rate change that will be reflected in the 2025 energy cost rate redetermination. The redetermined rate of per kWh became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2024 through the normal operation of the tariff. 
 
 Entergy Mississippi 
 
 In June 2024 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation agreement between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff for Entergy Mississippi s 2024 formula rate plan filing. The 2024 formula rate plan filing included the conclusion of the modified interim adjustments to Entergy Mississippi s energy cost recovery rider and power management rider, which were approved in October 2022 and allowed Entergy Mississippi to recover certain under-collected fuel balances. The stipulation provided for Entergy Mississippi to reduce its net energy cost factor. See Retail Rate Proceedings - Filings with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi) - Retail Rates - 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing below for further discussion of the 2024 formula rate plan filing and the joint stipulation agreement. 
 
 Entergy Texas 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2022 through March 2024. During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately billion in eligible fuel and purchased power expenses to generate and purchase electricity to serve its customers, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments. Entergy Texas s cumulative under-recovery balance for the reconciliation period was approximately million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as part of the cumulative fuel balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2024.

 resulting in a revenue deficiency of million. The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2023 historical year was resulting in a million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the 2025 projected year and 2023 historical year netting adjustment is million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to million. The APSC general staff and intervenors filed their errors and objections in October 2024, proposing certain adjustments, including the APSC general staff s update to annual filing year revenues that increases the constraint to million. Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal in October 2024, and later in October 2024 the parties submitted a joint issues list and stipulations setting forth the disputed issues and the noncontested issues.

 In June 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a tariff to provide retail customers a credit resulting from the terms of the settlement agreement between Entergy Arkansas, System Energy, additional named Entergy parties, and the APSC pertaining to System Energy s billings for wholesale sales of energy and capacity from the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. See Complaints Against System Energy - System Energy Settlement with the APSC below and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement. In July 2024 the APSC approved the tariff, under which Entergy Arkansas will refund to retail customers a total of million. To date, Entergy Arkansas has refunded million of the total through one-time bill credits during the August 2024 billing cycle.

 2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in August 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed an application for approval of a regulatory blueprint necessary for it to strengthen the electric grid for the State of Louisiana, which contains a dual-path request to update rates through either: (1) extension of Entergy Louisiana s current formula rate plan (with certain modifications) for three years (the Rate Mitigation Proposal), which is Entergy Louisiana s recommended path; or (2) implementation of rates resulting from a cost-of-service study (the Rate Case path). The application complies with Entergy Louisiana s previous formula rate plan extension order requiring that for Entergy Louisiana to obtain another extension of its formula rate plan that included a rate reset, Entergy Louisiana would need to submit a full cost-of-service rate case. Entergy Louisiana s filing supports the need to extend Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan with credit supportive mechanisms needed to facilitate investment in the distribution, transmission, and generation functions.

 allowed return on common equity with a bandwidth of basis points above and below the midpoint. For the 2023 test year, however, the bandwidth provisions of the formula rate plan are temporarily suspended and, pursuant to the terms of the global stipulated settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana implemented the September 2024 formula rate plan rate adjustments effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024. Those adjustments include a million increase in base rider formula rate plan revenue and a million one-time incremental net decrease consistent with the terms of the global stipulated settlement. The formula rate plan rate adjustments reflected in the evaluation report also include a redetermination of the transmission recovery mechanism, the distribution recovery mechanism, the additional capacity mechanism, the tax adjustment mechanism, the MISO cost recovery mechanism, and other one-time adjustments. Pursuant to the terms of the global stipulated settlement agreement, the review of the 2023 evaluation report shall be limited to these mechanisms and conducted under an expedited procedural schedule that provides a process for the parties to file and pursue resolution of any disputed issues by January 2025, after which any remaining disputed issues will be submitted to the ALJ for a contested proceeding and, ultimately, resolution by the LPSC.

 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2024 test year filing and 2023 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi s earned return on rate base for the historical 2023 calendar year to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2024 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2024 test year filing showed a million rate increase was necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi s earned return on rate base to the specified point of adjustment of , within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2023 look-back filing compared actual 2023 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflected change in formula rate plan revenues. In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to of 2023 retail revenues, effective April 2024. 
 
 In December 2014 the MPSC ordered Entergy Mississippi to file an updated depreciation study at least once every four years. Pursuant to this order and Entergy Mississippi s filing cycle, Entergy Mississippi would have filed an updated depreciation report with its formula rate plan filing in 2023. However, in July 2022 the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to file its next depreciation study in connection with its 2024 formula rate plan filing notwithstanding the MPSC s prior order. Accordingly, Entergy Mississippi filed a depreciation study in February 2024. The study showed a need for an increase in annual depreciation expense of million. The calculated increase in annual depreciation expense was excluded from Entergy Mississippi s 2024 formula rate plan revenue increase request because the MPSC had not yet approved the proposed depreciation rates. 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2024 test year filing, with the exception of immaterial adjustments to certain operation and maintenance expenses. After performance adjustments, the formula rate plan reflected an earned return on rate base of for calendar year 2024, which resulted in a total revenue increase of million for 2024. The joint stipulation also recommended approval of a revised customer charge of per month for residential customers and per month for general service customers. Pursuant to the stipulation, Entergy Mississippi s 2023 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of , resulting in an increase of million in the formula rate plan revenues for 2023. Finally, the stipulation recommended approval of Entergy Mississippi s proposed depreciation rates with those rates to be implemented upon request and approval at a later date. In June 2024 the

 kWh per month. Also in June 2024, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of million to reflect the difference between interim rates placed in effect in April 2024 and the rates reflected in the joint stipulation. 
 
 In May 2024, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC for formula rate plan revisions that were necessary for Entergy Mississippi to comply with state legislation passed in January 2024. The legislation allows Entergy Mississippi to make interim rate adjustments to recover the non-fuel related annual ownership cost of certain facilities that directly or indirectly provide service to customers who own certain data processing center projects as specified in the legislation. Entergy Mississippi filed the first of its annual interim facilities rate adjustment reports in May 2024 to recover approximately million of these costs over a six-month period with rates effective beginning in July 2024. 
 
 Grand Gulf Capacity Filing 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Mississippi filed a notice of intent with the MPSC to implement revisions to its unit power cost recovery rider that would allow Entergy Mississippi to recover the first year of costs associated with the transfer of Entergy Louisiana s interest in and purchases of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the revised rider schedule, effective by January 1, 2025. This notice filing relates to the divestiture of Entergy Louisiana s share of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and share of capacity and energy from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff. This divestiture will be effectuated initially through Entergy Mississippi s purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a PPA governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies as described in the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC and Entergy Louisiana. See Complaints Against System Energy - System Energy Settlement with the LPSC below for further details of the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC. In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi filed the proposed MSS-4 replacement PPA with the FERC. The parties requested that the MPSC and the FERC issue orders accepting the PPA no later than December 2024.

 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In April 2024, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2023 test year filing. Without the requested rate change in 2024, the 2023 test year evaluation report produced an electric earned return on equity of and a gas earned return on equity of compared to the authorized return on equity for each of . Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case and approved again by the City Council in 2023. The formula would result in an increase in authorized electric revenues of million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of million. Following City Council review, the City Council s advisors issued a report in July 2024 seeking a reduction in Entergy New Orleans s requested formula rate plan revenues in an aggregate amount of approximately million for electric and gas together due to alleged errors. Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation. The total formula rate plan increase implemented was million, which includes an increase of million in electric revenues and an increase of million in gas revenues.

 In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas s retail customers approximately million annually, or million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas s currently effective DCRF rider based on its capital invested in distribution between April 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024. In October 2024 the PUCT staff filed a recommendation that the PUCT approve Entergy Texas s as-filed application. A PUCT decision is expected in fourth quarter 2024. 
 
 Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider 
 
 In October 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas s retail customers approximately million annually based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 and changes in other transmission charges. Entergy Texas requested that the PUCT issue a decision in fourth quarter 2024, unless a hearing on the merits is requested. 
 
 Entergy Arkansas Opportunity Sales Proceeding 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding. As discussed in the Form 10-K, in September 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC s denial of recovery of million of payments to other Utility operating companies in December 2018 relating to off-system sales of electricity from 2002-2009, as ordered by the FERC. The complaint also involved a challenge to the million, plus interest, of related refunds ordered by the APSC and paid by Entergy Arkansas in August 2020. The trial was held in February 2023. Following the trial, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to expedite the appeal filed by Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc.

 MSS-4 Replacement Tariff Net Operating Loss Carryforward Proceeding 
 
 In January 2021, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, Entergy Services filed an amendment to the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies, in order to provide for the inclusion of specified accumulated deferred income taxes, including net operating loss carryforward accumulated deferred income taxes (NOLC ADIT), in the rate for sales of energy among the Utility operating companies on a prospective basis. In March 2021, the FERC accepted the filing, subject to refund and hearing procedures. 
 
 In October 2021 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that Entergy Services improperly excluded NOLC ADIT from MSS-4 replacement tariff rates in the period before March 20, 2021. The LPSC argued that sales from Entergy Louisiana to Entergy Texas and Entergy New Orleans were charged at rates lower than they otherwise should have been, and it accordingly seeks surcharges for the period prior to March 20, 2021. The FERC set the complaint for hearing procedures and subsequently the hearing for this complaint proceeding was consolidated with the hearing procedures for Entergy Services January 2021 NOLC ADIT filing. 
 
 Testimony was filed by parties in 2023, and the hearing before a FERC ALJ was concluded in February 2024. In June 2024, the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision addressing three major issues: (1) whether Entergy Services proposed prospective inclusion and allocation of NOLC ADIT in MSS-4 replacement tariff rates using a modified with-and-without methodology is just and reasonable; (2) whether Entergy Services correctly calculated excess and deficient accumulated deferred income taxes in accordance with the terms of a prior settlement; and (3) whether NOLC ADIT should have been included in MSS-4 replacement tariff rates prior to the effective date of the January 2021 MSS-4 replacement tariff filing. 
 
 With respect to issues (1) and (2), the presiding ALJ concluded that Entergy Services proposed methodology for allocating and including NOLC ADIT in MSS-4 replacement tariff rates was just and reasonable and that Entergy Services correctly performed the excess and deficient accumulated deferred income taxes calculations. With respect to issue (3), however, the presiding ALJ agreed with the LPSC that NOLC ADIT should have been included in MSS-4 replacement tariff rates since September 1, 2016, and as a result, the presiding ALJ ordered that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Arkansas recalculate bills for the period of September 1, 2016 through November 11, 2023 with surcharges expected to be due to those operating companies from the purchasing operating companies, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and Entergy Louisiana (for some Entergy Arkansas sales). The presiding ALJ also ordered Entergy Services to pay the interest owed to Entergy Louisiana on these surcharges. 
 
 The surcharge methodology that the presiding ALJ recommended in connection with issue (3) was not supported by any participant in the hearing. As part of their exceptions to the initial decision, all parties to the proceeding opposed the use of the ALJ s methodology, except for the FERC trial staff, which took no position. During the hearing, the LPSC and the FERC trial staff advocated that the alleged tariff violation should be remedied

 is no longer just and reasonable, and that the replacement authorized return on equity, based on application of the FERC s Opinion No. 569-A methodology, should be . The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (January 2017-April 2018) based on the difference between the current return on equity and the replacement authorized return on equity. The ALJ determined that the April 2018 complaint concerning the authorized return on equity should be dismissed, and that no refunds for a second fifteen-month refund period should be due. With regard to System Energy s capital structure, the ALJ determined that System Energy s actual equity ratio is excessive and that the just and reasonable equity ratio is equity, based on the average equity ratio of the proxy group used to evaluate the return on equity for the second complaint. The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (September 2018-December 2019) based on the difference between the actual equity ratio and the equity ratio. If the ALJ s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this proceeding is approximately million, which includes interest through September 30, 2024, and the estimated resulting annual rate reduction would be approximately million. As a result of the settlement agreements with the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council, the estimated refund and rate reduction only includes the portion related to Entergy Louisiana, whose settlement with the LPSC is pending FERC approval. See System Energy Settlement with the MPSC in the Form 10-K, see System Energy Settlement with the APSC below and in the Form 10-K, and see System Energy Settlement with the City Council below for discussion of the settlements. The estimated refund will continue to accrue interest until a final FERC decision is issued. 
 
 The ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process , and an ALJ s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on the FERC . In April 2021, System Energy filed its brief on exceptions, in which it challenged the initial decision s findings on both the return on equity and capital structure

 . In light of the System Energy settlements described below, the FERC s changes to its return on equity methodology in the decision on the MISO transmission owners return on equity will not have any immediate effect on System Energy s return on equity because System Energy s return on equity is locked-in through the end of June 2026. 
 
 Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy Services related to System Energy s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in December 1988 for an undivided interest in Grand Gulf Unit 1. The APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council subsequently intervened in the proceeding. A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ issued the initial decision, and in December 2022 the FERC issued an order on the ALJ s initial decision, which affirmed it in part and modified it in part. The FERC s order directed System Energy to calculate refunds on three issues, and to provide a compliance report detailing the calculations. The FERC s order also disallows the future recovery of sale-leaseback renewal costs, which is estimated at approximately million annually for purchases from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans through July 2036. The three refund issues are rental expenses related to the renewal of the sale-leaseback arrangements; refunds, if any, for the revenue requirement impact of including accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax positions from 2004 through the present; and refunds for the net effect of correcting the depreciation inputs for capital additions attributable to the portion of plant subject to the sale-leaseback. 
 
 In January 2023, System Energy filed its compliance report with the FERC. With respect to the sale-leaseback renewal costs, System Energy calculated a refund of million, which represented all of the sale-leaseback renewal rental costs that System Energy recovered in rates, with interest. With respect to the decommissioning uncertain tax position issue, System Energy calculated that no additional refunds are owed because it had already provided a one-time historical credit (for the period January 2016 through September 2020) of million based on the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position, and because it has been providing an ongoing rate base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position since October 2020. With respect to the depreciation refund, System Energy calculated a refund of million, which is the net total of a refund to customers for excess depreciation expense previously collected, plus interest, offset by the additional return on rate base that System Energy previously did not collect, without interest. 
 
 In January 2023, System Energy filed a request for rehearing of the FERC s determinations in the December 2022 order on sale-leaseback refund issues and future lease cost disallowances, the FERC s prospective policy on uncertain tax positions, and the proper accounting of System Energy s accumulated deferred income taxes adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and a motion for confirmation of its interpretation of the December 2022 order s remedy concerning the decommissioning tax position. In January 2023 the retail regulators

 million in total refunds, and the refunds were paid in January 2023. In October 2023, System Energy filed its compliance report with the FERC as directed in the August 2023 rehearing order. The October 2023 compliance report reflected recalculated refunds totaling million for the two issues resulting in million in refunds that could be recouped by System Energy. As discussed below in System Energy Settlement with the APSC , System Energy reached a settlement in principle with the APSC to resolve several pending cases under the FERC s jurisdiction, including this one, pursuant to which it has agreed not to recoup the million calculated for Entergy Arkansas in the compliance filing. Consistent with the compliance filing, in October 2023, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans paid recoupment amounts of million and million, respectively, to System Energy. 
 
 On the third refund issue identified in the rehearing requests, concerning the decommissioning uncertain tax positions, the rehearing order denied all rehearing requests, re-affirmed the remedy contained in the December 2022 order, and did not direct System Energy to recalculate refunds or to submit an additional compliance filing. On this issue, as reflected in its January 2023 compliance filing, System Energy believes it has already paid the refunds due under the remedy that the FERC outlined for the uncertain tax positions issue in its December 2022 order. In August 2023 the LPSC issued a media release in which it stated that it disagrees with System Energy s determination that the rehearing order requires no further refunds to be made on this issue. 
 
 In September 2023, System Energy filed a protective appeal of the rehearing order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The appeal was consolidated with System Energy s prior appeal of the December 2022 order. 
 
 In September 2023 the LPSC filed with the FERC a request for rehearing and clarification of the rehearing order. The LPSC requests that the FERC reverse its determination in the rehearing order that System Energy may collect an implied return of and on the depreciated cost of the portion of the plant subject to the sale-leaseback, as of the expiration of the initial lease term, as well as its determination in the rehearing order that System Energy may offset the refunds for the depreciation rate input issue and collect interest on the rate base recalculations that were part of the overall depreciation rate recalculations. In addition, the LPSC requests that the FERC either confirm the LPSC s interpretation of the refund associated with the decommissioning uncertain tax positions or explain why it is not doing so. In October 2023 the FERC issued a notice that the rehearing request has been deemed denied by

 million (inclusive of interest), plus additional refund amounts with interest to be calculated for certain issues to be distributed to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans as the Utility operating companies other than Entergy Mississippi purchasing under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement further provided that if the APSC, the City Council, or the LPSC agrees to the global settlement System Energy entered into with the MPSC (see System Energy Settlement with the MPSC in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement), and such global settlement includes a black box refund amount, then the black box refund for this settlement agreement shall not be incremental or in addition to the global black box refund amount. The settlement agreement addressed other matters as well, including adjustments to rate base beginning in October 2022, exclusion of certain other costs, and inclusion of money pool borrowings, if any, in short-term debt within the cost of capital calculation used in the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In April 2023 the FERC approved the settlement agreement. The refund provided for in the settlement agreement was included in the May 2023 service month bills under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
 
 In May 2023 the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision finding that System Energy should have excluded multiple identified categories of accumulated deferred income taxes from rate base when calculating Unit Power Sales Agreement bills. Based on this finding, the initial decision recommended refunds; System Energy estimates that those refunds for Entergy Louisiana would total approximately million plus million of interest through September 30, 2024. The initial decision also finds that the Unit Power Sales Agreement should be modified such that a cash working capital allowance of negative million is applied prospectively. If the FERC ultimately orders these modifications to cash working capital be implemented, the estimated annual revenue requirement impact is expected to be immaterial. On the other non-settled issues for which the complainants sought refunds or changes to the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the initial decision ruled against the complainants. 
 
 The initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process, and an ALJ s determination made in an initial decision is not controlling on the FERC. System Energy disagrees with the ALJ s findings concerning the accumulated deferred income taxes issues and cash working capital. In July 2023, System Energy filed a brief on exceptions to the initial decision s accumulated deferred income taxes findings. Also in July 2023, the APSC, the LPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff filed separate briefs on exceptions. The APSC s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the money pool interest and retained earnings issues. The LPSC s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations regarding the sale-leaseback transaction costs, legal fees, and retained earnings issues. The City Council s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the money pool and cash management issues. The FERC trial staff s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the cash working capital issue as well as certain of the accumulated deferred income taxes issues. In August 2023 all parties filed separate briefs opposing exceptions. System Energy filed a brief opposing the exceptions of the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council. The APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council filed separate briefs opposing the exceptions raised by System Energy and the FERC trial staff. The FERC trial staff filed its own brief opposing certain exceptions raised by System Energy, the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council. The case is now pending a decision by the FERC. Refunds, if any, that might be required will become due only after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial decision. 
 
 LPSC Petition for a Writ of Mandamus 
 
 In March 2024 the LPSC filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit direct the FERC to take action on (1) System Energy s pending compliance filings (and the LPSC s protests) in response to the FERC s orders on the uncertain tax position rate base issue, as discussed above; and (2) the ALJ s pending initial decision in the return on equity and capital structure proceeding, also as discussed above. System Energy filed a notice of intervention in the proceeding. 
 
 In March 2024 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit directed the FERC to respond to the LPSC s petition. Also in March 2024, System Energy filed its response to the LPSC s petition, in which it opposed the LPSC s mandamus request on the compliance filing and took no position on the request for action on the return

 million global black box settlement reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022 and provide for Entergy Arkansas to receive a black box refund of million from System Energy, inclusive of million already received by Entergy Arkansas from System Energy. 
 
 In addition to the black box refund of million described above, beginning with the November 2023 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy Arkansas s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of and a capital structure not to exceed equity. 
 
 In December 2023 the FERC trial staff and the LPSC filed comments. The FERC trial staff commented that it believes that the settlement is fair, and in the public interest, and neither it nor the LPSC oppose the settlement. In December 2023 the remaining black box refund to Entergy Arkansas was reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. In March 2024 the FERC approved the settlement because it appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. System Energy paid the remaining black box refund of million to Entergy Arkansas in May 2024. 
 
 System Energy Settlement with the City Council 
 
 In April 2024, System Energy, Entergy New Orleans, and additional named Entergy parties involved in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC reached a settlement in principle with the City Council to globally resolve all of their actual and potential claims in those dockets and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement also covers the amended and supplemental complaint, discussed in Grand Gulf Prudence Complaint in the Form 10-K, filed by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council at the FERC in October 2023. In May 2024, System Energy, Entergy New Orleans, additional named Entergy parties, and the City Council filed the settlement agreement and supporting materials with the FERC. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is a FERC-jurisdictional formula rate tariff for sales of energy and capacity from System Energy s owned and leased share of Grand Gulf to Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. 
 
 The terms of the settlement with the City Council align with the million global black box settlement amount reflected in the prior settlements reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022 and between System Energy and the APSC in November 2023. The settlement provides for Entergy New Orleans to receive a

 In addition to the black box refund of million described above, beginning with the June 2024 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy New Orleans s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of and a capital structure not to exceed equity. 
 
 In August 2024 the FERC approved the settlement because it appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. System Energy paid the remaining black box refund of million to Entergy New Orleans in October 2024. As discussed above and in Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, System Energy previously settled with the MPSC and the APSC with respect to these complaints before the FERC. The settlements with the APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council represent almost of System Energy s share of the output of Grand Gulf. 
 
 System Energy Settlement with the LPSC 
 
 In July 2024, System Energy and the LPSC staff reached a settlement in principle to globally resolve all of the LPSC s actual and potential claims in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC (including all docketed proceedings resolved by the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council settlements) and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement also covers the amended and supplemental complaint, discussed in Grand Gulf Prudence Complaint in the Form 10-K, filed by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council at the FERC in October 2023. In August 2024 the LPSC approved the settlement. In September 2024 the settling parties filed the settlement for approval by the FERC. 
 
 The terms of the settlement with the LPSC align with the million global black box settlement amount reflected in the prior settlements reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022, between System Energy and the APSC in November 2023, and between System Energy and the City Council in April 2024. The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to receive a black box refund of million from System Energy, inclusive of approximately million already received by Entergy Louisiana from System Energy. In June 2024 the remaining million black box refund to Entergy Louisiana was reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. 
 
 In addition to the black box refund of million described above, beginning with the September 2024 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of and a capital structure not to exceed equity. 
 
 The settlement also includes an agreement that, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, Entergy Louisiana will divest to Entergy Mississippi all of its interest in Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its purchases from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff. Subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, divestiture will be effective on January 1, 2025. In October 2024 Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi filed with the FERC a power purchase agreement under which Entergy Mississippi would purchase Entergy Louisiana s purchases of Grand Gulf capacity and energy. The power purchase agreement is governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies. The parties requested that the FERC issue an order accepting the power purchase agreement no later than December 2024.

 Unit Power Sales Agreement 
 
 System Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2022 Calendar Year Bills 
 
 In February 2024, pursuant to the protocols procedures discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, the LPSC and the City Council filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2022. The formal challenge alleges: (1) that the equity ratio charged in rates was excessive; and (2) that all issues in the pending Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint proceeding should also be reflected in calendar year 2022 bills. These allegations are identical to issues that were raised in the formal challenge to the calendar year 2020 and 2021 bills. 
 
 In March 2024, System Energy filed an answer to the formal challenge in which it requested that the FERC deny the formal challenge as a matter of law, or else hold the proceeding in abeyance pending the resolution of related dockets. 
 
 Pension Costs Amendment Proceeding 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2021, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to include in the rate base the prepaid and accrued pension costs associated with System Energy s qualified pension plans. Based on data ending in 2020, the increased annual revenue requirement associated with the filing is approximately million. In March 2022 the FERC accepted System Energy s proposed amendments with an effective date of December 1, 2021, subject to refund pending the outcome of the settlement and/or hearing procedures. In August 2023 the FERC chief ALJ terminated settlement procedures and designated a presiding ALJ to oversee hearing procedures. In October 2023, System Energy filed direct testimony in support of its proposed amendments. Under the procedural schedule, testimony was filed through April 2024, and the hearing occurred in late May and early June 2024. 
 
 In September 2024 the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision recommending that t he FERC appro ve inclusion of a line item for prepaid and accrued pension costs; however, the presiding ALJ did not agree with System Energy s proposed methodology to calculate the value of the prepaid and accrued pension cost input. Instead, the presiding ALJ recommended limiting System Energy s recovery to the prepaid and accrued pension costs that were incurred beginning in 2015 and later. 
 
 System Energy disputes the presiding ALJ's determination concerning the methodology used to calculate the prepaid and accrued pension input, and System Energy filed exceptions to these rulings in October 2024. If the ALJ s determination is affirmed by the FERC, System Energy estimates refunds, including interest through September 30, 2024, of approximat ely million to million would be owed related to the ALJ s findings. The ALJ's initial decision is not binding on the FERC and is an interim step in the hearing process. No refunds will be owed in connection with this proc eeding and no changes to System Energy s pension cost recovery methodology will be implemented unless and until the FERC requires them in a final order. This proceeding is not covered by the global settlements described above.

 million per month. If Entergy Mississippi s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeded million, the collection of the storm damage provision ceased until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision became less than million. 
 
 In December 2023, Entergy Mississippi filed a Notice of Storm Escrow Disbursement and Request for Interim Relief notifying the MPSC that Entergy Mississippi had requested disbursement of approximately million of storm escrow funds from its restricted storm escrow account. The filing also requested authorization from the MPSC, on a temporary basis, that the million of storm escrow funds be credited to Entergy Mississippi s storm damage provision, pending the MPSC s review of Entergy Mississippi s storm-related costs, and that Entergy Mississippi continue to bill its monthly storm damage provision without suspension in the event the storm damage provision balance exceeds million, in anticipation of a subsequent filing by Entergy Mississippi in this proceeding. The storm damage reserve exceeded million upon receipt of the storm escrow funds. Because the MPSC had not entered an order on Entergy Mississippi s filing on the requested relief to continue billing this provision, Entergy Mississippi suspended billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with February 2024 bills. 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Mississippi made a combined dual filing which included a Notice of Intent to Make Routine Change in Rates and Schedules and a Motion for Determination relating to the above-described Notice of Storm Escrow Disbursement. The Notice of Intent proposed a new storm damage mitigation and restoration rider to supersede both the current storm damage rate schedule and the vegetation management rider schedule, in which the collection of both expenses would be combined. The proposal requests that the MPSC authorize Entergy Mississippi to collect a storm damage provision of million per month. Furthermore, if Entergy Mississippi s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeds million , collection of the storm damage provision would cease until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision becomes less than million. 
 
 The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff reviewed the storm-related costs submitted by Entergy Mississippi and found them prudent. In June 2024 the MPSC considered and unanimously granted the relief sought by Entergy Mississippi, including authorization to credit any remaining funds in the storm escrow account to Entergy Mississippi s storm damage reserve and to close the storm escrow account. Entergy Mississippi s storm escrow account was liquidated in July 2024, and t he new combined storm damage mitigation and restoration rider became effective with the July 2024 billing cycle. Additionally, Entergy Mississippi made a compliance filing to cease billing under the existing vegetation management rider schedule as of the same billing cycle.

 Other Equity Awards 
 
 In January 2024 the Board approved and Entergy granted long-term incentive awards in the form of restricted stock awards and performance units under the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The restricted stock awards were made effective on January 25, 2024 and were valued at per share, which was the closing price of Entergy Corporation s common stock on that date. Shares of restricted stock have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock, are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon vesting, and are expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period. One-third of the restricted stock awards and accrued dividends will vest upon each anniversary of the grant date. 
 
 The performance units represent the value of, and are settled with, one share of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period on the number of performance units earned. To emphasize the importance of environmental stewardship, specifically of carbon-free generation and resilience, an environmental achievement measure was selected as one of the performance measures for the 2024-2026 performance period. Performance will be based percent on relative total shareholder return and percent on the environmental achievement measure. The performance units were granted on January 25, 2024 and percent were valued at per share based on various factors, primarily market conditions; and percent were valued at per share, the closing price of Entergy Corporation s common stock on that date. Performance units have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock and are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon vesting, and are expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period, and compensation cost for the portion of the award based on the selected environmental achievement measure will be adjusted based on the number of units that ultimately vest. See Note 12 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a description of the Long-Term Performance Unit Program.

 Accounting for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 In accordance with accounting standards, the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations and are presented by Entergy in miscellaneous - net in other income. 
 
 Qualified Pension Settlement Costs 
 
 In May 2024, Entergy Corporation entered into a commitment agreement by and between Entergy Corporation, Newport Trust Company, LLC, as independent fiduciary of Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Non-Bargaining Employees, Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Bargaining Employees, Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III, and Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Bargaining Employees (the Pension Plans), and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), under which the Pension Plans purchased a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract from MetLife to settle approximately billion of benefit liabilities of the Pension Plans.

 non-utility business retirees, joint annuitants, beneficiaries, and alternate payees who commenced benefit payments from the Pension Plans on or before March 1, 2024 (Transferred Participants). MetLife irrevocably guarantees and assumes the sole obligation to make future monthly pension benefit payments to the Transferred Participants as provided under its group annuity contract, with direct payments that began September 1, 2024. The aggregate amount of each Transferred Participant s payment under the group annuity contract will be equal to the amount of each individual s payment under the Pension Plans. 
 
 The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by assets of the Pension Plans. The transferred pension liability required no additional funding prior to transfer, as the liability was fully funded. As a result of the transaction, Entergy recognized a one-time non-cash pension settlement charge in the second quarter of 2024 of million, of which million was recorded at Utility, as described below, and million was recorded at Parent Other. The million settlement charge at Parent Other is reflected in Miscellaneous - net in Other income (deductions) on the consolidated income statements. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, lump sum benefit payments from the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees and the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees exceeded the sum of the Plans 2023 service and interest cost, resulting in settlement costs. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy each participate in one or both of the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees and the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees and incurred settlement costs. 
 
 In accordance with accounting standards, settlement accounting requires immediate recognition of the portion of previously unrecognized losses associated with the settled portion of the plan s pension liability. Similar to other pension costs, the settlement costs were included with employee labor costs and charged to expense and capital in the same manner that labor costs were charged. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans each received regulatory approval to defer the expense portion of the settlement costs, with future amortization of the deferred settlement expense over the period in which the expense otherwise would be recorded had the immediate recognition not occurred. 
 
 In September 2020, Entergy Texas elected to establish a reserve, in accordance with PUCT regulations, to track the surplus or deficit in the annual amount of actuarially determined pension and other postretirement benefits chargeable to Entergy Texas s expense. The reserve amounts recorded are evaluated in each rate case filed by Entergy Texas and an amortization period is determined at that time.

 Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries has one reportable segment, which is an integrated utility business, except for System Energy, which is an electricity generation business. Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries operations are managed on an integrated basis by that company because of the substantial effect of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures, and operating results.

 months for Entergy Mississippi. The total volume of natural gas swaps and options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is MMBtu for Entergy and Entergy Mississippi. As of September 30, 2024, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans had outstanding natural gas swaps or options. Credit support for these natural gas swaps and options is covered by master agreements that do not require Entergy to provide collateral based on mark-to-market value, but do carry adequate assurance language that may lead to requests for collateral. 
 
 During the second quarter 2024, Entergy participated in the annual financial transmission rights auction process for the MISO planning year of June 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025. Financial transmission rights are derivative instruments that represent economic hedges of future congestion charges that will be incurred in serving Entergy s customer load. They are not designated as hedging instruments. Entergy initially records financial transmission rights at their estimated fair value and subsequently adjusts the carrying value to their estimated fair value at the end of each accounting period prior to settlement. Unrealized gains or losses on financial transmission rights held by the non-utility operations are included in operating revenues. The Utility operating companies recognize regulatory liabilities or assets for unrealized gains or losses on financial transmission rights. The total volume of financial transmission rights outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is GWh for Entergy, including GWh for Entergy Arkansas, GWh for Entergy Louisiana, GWh for Entergy Mississippi, GWh for Entergy New Orleans, and GWh for Entergy Texas. Credit support for financial transmission rights held by the Utility operating companies is covered by cash and/or letters of credit issued by each Utility operating company as required by MISO. Credit support for financial transmission rights held by Entergy s non-utility operations business is covered by cash. No cash or letters of credit were required to be posted for financial transmission rights exposure for the non-utility operations business as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Letters of credit posted with MISO covered the financial transmission rights exposure for Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas as of September 30, 2024 and for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas as of December 31, 2023.

Fair Values 
 
 The estimated fair values of Entergy s financial instruments and derivatives are determined using historical prices, bid prices, market quotes, and financial modeling. Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange. Gains or losses realized on financial instruments are reflected in future rates and therefore do not affect net income.

 (a) Sales for resale includes day-ahead sales of energy in a market administered by an ISO. These sales represent financially binding commitments for the sale of physical energy the next day. These sales are adjusted to actual power generated and delivered in the real time market. Given the short duration of these transactions, Entergy does not consider them to be derivatives subject to fair value adjustments and includes them as part of customer revenues. 
 (b) Other electric revenues consist primarily of transmission and ancillary services provided to participants of an ISO-administered market, unbilled revenue, and certain customer credits as directed by regulators. 
 (c) Other Utility revenues include the equity component of carrying costs related to securitization, occasional sales of inventory, alternative revenue programs, provisions for revenue subject to refund, and late fees.

 million decrease in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding decreases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the units. 
 
 In first quarter 2024, Entergy Mississippi recorded an asset retirement obligation to reflect decommissioning costs related to an obligation under the Sunflower Solar facility s land lease agreements to remove the electrical system and return the land to its normal condition. This estimate resulted in the establishment of a million decommissioning cost liability, along with the establishment of a related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining initial lease term. See Note 14 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of Entergy Mississippi s purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility. 
 
 In second quarter 2024, revisions were recorded to the estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for White Bluff and Independence as a result of the EPA rule that was finalized in May 2024 establishing management standards for legacy coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundments (i.e., inactive surface impoundments at inactive power plants) and establishing a new class of units referred to as CCR management units (CCRMUs) (i.e., non-containerized CCR located at a regulated CCR facility). Entergy does not have any legacy impoundments; however, the definition of CCR management units includes on-site areas where CCR was beneficially used. This is contrary to the previous CCR rule which exempted beneficial uses that met certain criteria. Under this expanded rule, all facilities must identify and delineate any CCRMU greater than one ton and submit a facility evaluation report by February 2026. Any potential requirements for corrective action or operational changes under the various CCR rules continue to be assessed. Given the complexity and recency of the EPA guidance, Entergy is still evaluating the level of work that will ultimately be required to comply with the rule. Based on initial estimates of multiple possible remediation scenarios, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recorded increases of million and million, respectively, in their decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the

 In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas signed a build-own-transfer agreement for the purchase of an approximately MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic energy facility, West Memphis Solar facility, to be sited on approximately 1,500 acres in Crittenden County, Arkansas. Acquisition of the West Memphis Solar facility was initially approved by the APSC in October 2021. In March 2022 the counterparty to the build-own-transfer agreement notified Entergy Arkansas that it was seeking changes to certain terms of the agreement, including both cost and schedule. Entergy Arkansas filed a supplemental application with the APSC in January 2023 for a change in the transmission route and updates to the cost and schedule, which was approved by the APSC in March 2023. In August 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately million to acquire the facility. The project will commence commercial operation once testing is completed and the project has achieved substantial completion. Entergy Arkansas expects the project to commence commercial operation in November 2024, at which time a substantial completion payment of approximately million is expected.

 MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income increased 86.6 million primarily due to write-offs in third quarter 2023 of 78.4 million 58.8 million net-of-tax) recorded as a result of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. Also contributing to the increase were higher retail electric price, an 18.3 million reduction in income tax expense as a result of the resolution of an Arkansas state income tax audit, and higher other income, partially offset by lower volume/weather. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the resolution of the Arkansas state income tax audit. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income increased 23.3 million primarily due to write-offs in third quarter 2023 of 78.4 million 58.8 million net-of-tax) recorded as a result of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. Also contributing to the increase were higher retail electric price, higher other income, and higher volume/weather. The increase was partially offset by a 131.8 million 99.1 million net-of-tax) charge to reflect the write-off of a previously recorded regulatory asset as a result of an adverse decision in the opportunity sales proceeding in March 2024 and higher interest expense. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 831.7 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (82.7) Retail one-time bill credit (92.3) Volume/weather (16.2) Retail electric price 21.6 2024 operating revenues 662.1

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Entergy Arkansas s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The retail one-time bill credit represents the disbursement of settlement proceeds in the form of a one-time bill credit provided to Entergy Arkansas s retail customers during the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. There is no effect on net income because Entergy Arkansas previously recorded a regulatory liability for the effects of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by an increase in weather-adjusted residential usage. The increase in weather-adjusted residential usage is primarily due to an increase in customers. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective January 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2023 formula rate plan filing. 
 
 Total electric energy sales for Entergy Arkansas for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 2,030.8 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (114.6) Retail one-time bill credit (92.3) Volume/weather 12.5 Retail electric price 56.6 2024 operating revenues 1,893.0 
 
 Entergy Arkansas s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The retail one-time bill credit represents the disbursement of settlement proceeds in the form of a one-time bill credit provided to Entergy Arkansas s retail customers during the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. There is no effect on net income because Entergy Arkansas previously recorded a regulatory liability for the effects of the System Energy settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of an increase in residential and industrial usage. The increase in residential usage is primarily due to an increase in customers. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily new customers in the technology industry, and an increase in demand from small industrial customers. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective January 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2023 formula rate plan filing.

 Other Income Statement Variances 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Asset write-offs includes the effects of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. In third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded write-offs of its regulatory asset for deferred fuel of 68.9 million and the undepreciated balance of 9.5 million in capital costs related to the ANO stator incident. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes the reversal in third quarter 2024 of a 92.3 million regulatory liability recognized for the obligation to return to customers the refund from the System Energy settlement with the APSC. The reversal of the regulatory liability offsets a reduction in gross revenues from the retail one-time bill credits provided to customers in the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to higher interest earned on money pool investments and a decrease of 5.5 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in third quarter 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of 400 million of 5.75 Series mortgage bonds and 400 million of 5.45 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024, and the issuance of 300 million of 5.30

 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of 375 million of 3.70 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale includes a credit of 9 million, recorded in first quarter 2024, for costs related to net metering. The costs were incurred in 2023 and included within Entergy Arkansas s annual redetermination of its energy cost recovery rider filed in March 2024 due to a change in law in the state of Arkansas. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the March 2024 energy cost recovery rider filing. 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 the effects of recording a final judgment in first quarter 2023 to resolve claims in the ANO damages case against the DOE related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs. The damages awarded included the reimbursement of approximately 10.3 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; 
 an increase of 8.9 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to the timing of recovery from customers; and 
 an increase of 6.9 million in contract costs related to operational performance, customer service, and organizational health initiatives. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 4.9 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work during plant outages performed in 2024 as compared to 2023 and a decrease of 5.4 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to lower nuclear labor costs in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Asset write-offs includes: 
 
 a 131.8 million 99.1 million net-of-tax) charge to reflect the write-off of a previously recorded regulatory asset as a result of an adverse decision in the opportunity sales proceeding in March 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding; and 
 the effects of a commitment, made in October 2023, by Entergy Arkansas to the APSC to make a filing seeking to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident. In third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded write-offs of its regulatory asset for deferred fuel of 68.9 million and the undepreciated balance of 9.5 million in capital costs related to the ANO stator incident. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the ANO stator incident, Entergy Arkansas s October 2023 commitment to the APSC, and the subsequently approved motion to forgo recovery. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes the reversal in third quarter 2024 of a 92.3 million regulatory liability recognized for the obligation to return to customers the refund from the System Energy settlement with the APSC. The reversal of the regulatory liability offsets a reduction in gross revenues from the retail one-time bill credits provided to customers in the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider. Additionally, Entergy Arkansas records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue.

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Other income increased primarily due to: 
 
 changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of the decommissioning trust funds in first quarter 2024; 
 a decrease of 12.1 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; and 
 higher interest earned on money pool investments. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 300 million of 5.30 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023 and the issuances of 400 million of 5.75 Series mortgage bonds and 400 million of 5.45 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of 375 million of 3.70 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024 and the repayment of 250 million of 3.05 Series mortgage bonds in June 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 16.2 for the third quarter 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the resolution of an Arkansas state income tax audit, partially offset by the accrual for state income taxes and the amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of tax rate changes. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the resolution of the Arkansas state income tax audit. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 18.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the resolution of an Arkansas state income tax audit, certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, and book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction, partially offset by the accrual for state income taxes and the amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of tax rate changes. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the resolution of the Arkansas state income tax audit. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 23.4 for the third quarter 2023. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, partially offset by certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 21.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, partially offset by certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items and amortization of state accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of tax rate changes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flow 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 3,632 5,278 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 836,755 762,386 Investing activities (1,252,242) (822,851) Financing activities 1,052,038 168,586 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 636,551 108,121 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 640,183 113,399 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased 74.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 lower fuel and purchased power payments; 
 the timing of payments to vendors; 
 a decrease of 23.2 million in storm spending in 2024 as compared to 2023; 
 a decrease of 20.9 million in pension contributions resulting from the timing of contributions in 2024 compared to 2023. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding; 
 a decrease of 8 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 
 the receipt of 92.7 million in settlement proceeds in 2024 as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC, which was subsequently refunded to retail customers in third quarter 2024 with one-time bill credits through the Grand Gulf credit rider. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the System Energy settlement agreement with the APSC and see Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery; 
 the refund of 41.7 million received from System Energy in January 2023 related to the sale-leaseback renewal costs and depreciation litigation as calculated in System Energy s January 2023 compliance report filed with the FERC. The refund was subsequently applied to the under-recovered deferred fuel balance. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the refund and the related proceedings; 
 an increase of 24.7 million in interest paid; and 
 23.2 million in proceeds received from the DOE in April 2023 resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously expensed. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.

 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities increased 429.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 the initial payment of approximately 307.7 million in August 2024 for the purchase of the Driver Solar facility; 
 the initial and substantial completion payments totaling approximately 185.5 million in 2024 for the purchase of the Walnut Bend Solar facility; 
 the initial payment of approximately 48.4 million in August 2024 for the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility; 
 money pool activity; 
 an increase in cash used of 28 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, materials and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and 
 17.9 million in proceeds received from the DOE in April 2023 resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously recorded as plant. See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 a decrease of 151.6 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024; 
 a decrease of 34.4 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to decreased spending on various nuclear projects in 2024; and 
 a decrease of 16.7 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to decreased spending on various transmission projects in 2024. 
 
 Increases in Entergy Arkansas s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas s receivable from the money pool increased 65.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to increasing by 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings. 
 
 See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the Driver Solar facility, the Walnut Bend Solar facility, and the West Memphis Solar facility purchases. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased 883.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 the issuances of 400 million of 5.45 Series mortgage bonds and 400 million of 5.75 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024; 
 capital contributions of approximately 695 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2024 in anticipation of upcoming expenditures, which included the acquisitions of the Walnut Bend Solar facility, the Driver Solar facility, and the West Memphis Solar facility; 
 the repayment, at maturity, of 250 million of 3.05 Series mortgage bonds in June 2023; 
 142 million in common equity distributions paid in 2023 in order to maintain Entergy Arkansas s capital structure;

 Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 the issuance of 70 million of 5.54 Series O notes by the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in March 2024; 
 money pool activity; and 
 an increase of 33.1 million in prepaid deposits related to contributions-in-aid-of-construction primarily for customer and generator interconnection agreements. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the issuance of 425 million of 5.15 Series mortgage bonds in January 2023; 
 the repayment, at maturity, of 375 million of 3.70 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024; 
 the issuance of 300 million of 5.30 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023; and 
 net repayments of 31.7 million in 2024 compared to net borrowings of 10.6 million in 2023 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity s credit facility. 
 
 Decreases in Entergy Arkansas s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas s payable to the money pool decreased 145.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 180.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 See Note 4 to the financial statements herein and Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for more details on long-term debt. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 Entergy Arkansas s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Arkansas is primarily due to capital contributions of 695 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2024, partially offset by the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 52.3 55.5 Effect of subtracting cash (3.3 Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 49.0 55.5 
 
 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

 Entergy Arkansas is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates making 2.5 billion in capital investments during that period. In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the preliminary estimate includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Arkansas s portfolio; investments in ANO 1 and 2; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 
 
 Entergy Arkansas s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 (In Thousands) 65,835 145,385) 11,104 180,795) 
 
 See Note 4 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a description of the money pool. 
 
 Entergy Arkansas has a credit facility in the amount of 300 million scheduled to expire in June 2029. Entergy Arkansas also has a 25 million credit facility scheduled to expire in April 2026.

 Renewables 
 
 Walnut Bend Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 100 MW Walnut Bend Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest. Entergy Arkansas primarily requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. Acquisition of the Walnut Bend Solar facility was initially approved by the APSC in July 2021. The agreement was amended by the parties in February 2023, and the revised agreement was approved by the APSC in July 2023. In February 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 169.7 million to acquire the facility. Substantial completion was achieved and commercial operation commenced in September 2024, at which time Entergy Arkansas made a substantial completion payment of approximately 15.8 million for acquisition of the

 facility. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the purchase of the Walnut Bend Solar facility. 
 
 West Memphis Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in January 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 180 MW West Memphis Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest. In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas signed an agreement for the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility, to be sited on approximately 1,500 acres in Crittenden County, Arkansas. Acquisition of the West Memphis Solar facility was initially approved by the APSC in October 2021. In March 2022 the counterparty to the build-own-transfer agreement notified Entergy Arkansas that it was seeking changes to certain terms of the agreement, including both cost and schedule. Entergy Arkansas filed a supplemental application with the APSC in January 2023 for a change in the transmission route and updates to the cost and schedule, which was approved by the APSC in March 2023. In August 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 48.4 million to acquire the facility. The project will commence commercial operation once testing is completed and the project has achieved substantial completion. Entergy Arkansas expects the project to commence commercial operation in November 2024, at which time a substantial completion payment of approximately 200 million is expected. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility. 
 
 Driver Solar 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in April 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 250 MW Driver Solar facility pursuant to a build-own-transfer agreement is in the public interest and requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In August 2022 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas s petition and approved the acquisition of Driver Solar and cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In August 2024, Entergy Arkansas made an initial payment of approximately 307.7 million to acquire the facility. The project will commence commercial operation once testing is completed and the project has achieved substantial completion. Entergy Arkansas currently expects the project to commence commercial operation by the end of 2024, at which time a substantial completion payment of approximately 100 million is expected. See Note 14 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the purchase of the Driver Solar facility. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery in the Form 10-K for a discussion of state and local rate regulation and fuel-cost recovery. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Retail Rates 
 
 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In July 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2024 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2025 calendar year. The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas s earnings for the 2025 projected year and a netting adjustment for the 2023 historical year. The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2025 projected year was 8.43 resulting in a revenue deficiency of 69.5 million. The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2023 historical year was 7.48 resulting in a 33.1 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the 2025 projected year and 2023 historical year netting adjustment is 102.6 million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to 82.6 million. The APSC general staff and intervenors filed their errors and objections in October 2024, proposing 
 
 110 

Table of Contents 
 Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries 
 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 certain adjustments, including the APSC general staff s update to annual filing year revenues that increases the constraint to 86.8 million. Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal in October 2024, and later in October 2024 the parties submitted a joint issues list and stipulations setting forth the disputed issues and the noncontested issues. A hearing is scheduled for November 2024. 
 
 Grand Gulf Credit Rider 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a tariff to provide retail customers a credit resulting from the terms of the settlement agreement between Entergy Arkansas, System Energy, additional named Entergy parties, and the APSC pertaining to System Energy s billings for wholesale sales of energy and capacity from the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. See Complaints Against System Energy - System Energy Settlement with the APSC in Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement. In July 2024 the APSC approved the tariff, under which Entergy Arkansas will refund to retail customers a total of 100.6 million. To date, Entergy Arkansas has refunded 92.3 million of the total through one-time bill credits during the August 2024 billing cycle. 
 
 Energy Cost Recovery Rider 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease in the rate from 0.01883 per kWh to 0.00882 per kWh. Due to a change in law in the State of Arkansas, the annual redetermination included 9 million, recorded as a credit to fuel expense in first quarter 2024, for recovery attributed to net metering costs in 2023. The primary reason for the rate decrease is a large over-recovered balance as a result of lower natural gas prices in 2023. To mitigate the effect of projected increases in natural gas prices in 2024, Entergy Arkansas adjusted the over-recovered balance included in the March 2024 annual redetermination filing by 43.7 million. This adjustment is expected to reduce the rate change that will be reflected in the 2025 energy cost rate redetermination. The redetermined rate of 0.00882 per kWh became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2024 through the normal operation of the tariff. 
 
 Opportunity Sales Proceeding 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding. As discussed in the Form 10-K, in September 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC s denial of recovery of 135 million of payments to other Utility operating companies in December 2018 relating to off-system sales of electricity from 2002-2009, as ordered by the FERC. The complaint also involved a challenge to the 13.7 million, plus interest, of related refunds ordered by the APSC and paid by Entergy Arkansas in August 2020. The trial was held in February 2023. Following the trial, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to expedite the appeal filed by Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted Entergy Arkansas s request, and oral arguments were held in June 2023. In August 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the order of the court denying Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. s motion to intervene. 
 
 In March 2024 the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas issued a judgment in favor of the APSC and against Entergy Arkansas. In March 2024 Entergy Arkansas filed a notice of appeal and a motion to expedite oral arguments with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the court granted the motion to expedite. Briefing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded in July 2024 and oral arguments concluded in September 2024. The appeal is pending with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. As a result of the adverse decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Entergy Arkansas concluded that it could no longer support the recognition of its 131.8 million regulatory asset reflecting the previously-expected recovery of a portion of the costs at issue in the opportunity sales proceeding and recorded a 131.8 million 99.1 million net-of-tax) charge to earnings in first quarter 2024.

 MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 9.5 million primarily due to lower volume/weather, partially offset by lower other operation and maintenance expenses and higher retail electric price. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 203 million prima rily due to expenses of 151.5 million 110.7 million net-of-tax), recorded in second quarter 2024, primarily consisting of regulatory charges to reflect the effects of an agreement in principle between Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff and the intervenors in July 2024 to renew Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan and resolve a number of other retail dockets and matters, including all formula rate plan test years prior to 2023. Also contributing to the decrease were the net effects of Entergy Louisiana s storm cost securitization in March 2023, including a 133.4 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a 103.4 million 76.4 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge to reflect Entergy Louisiana s obligation to provide credits to its customers as described in an LPSC ancillary order issued as part of the securitization regulatory proceeding, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and higher interest expense. The decrease was partially offset by higher other income and higher retail electric price. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the agreement in principle and the subsequently filed global stipulated settlement agreement . See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the March 2023 storm cost securitization. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 1,434.9 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income 70.3 Retail electric price 19.9 Volume/weather (47.0) 2024 operating revenues 1,478.1

 Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries 
 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan revenues, including increases in the distribution and transmission recovery mechanisms, effective September 2023 and September 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the formula rate plan proceedings. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and a decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage, partially offset by an increase in industrial usage. The decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage is primarily due to the effects of Hurricane Francine in the third quarter 2024. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the petroleum refining and chlor-alkali industries. 
 
 Total electric energy sales for Entergy Louisiana for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Entergy Louisiana records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to: 
 
 a decrease of 10.5 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in third quarter 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; and 
 changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of the River Bend decommissioning trust fund in third quarter 2024. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of 500 million of 5.35 Series mortgage bonds and 700 million of 5.70 Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2024, and the issuance of 700 million of 5.15 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024. The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the repayment of 325 million of 4.05 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023;

 an increase of 5.4 million in loss provisions; 
 an increase of 4.2 million in transmission costs allocated by MISO. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the recovery of these costs; and 
 an increase of 3.9 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work, including during plant outages, performed in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 6.9 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to the timing of vegetation maintenance costs. 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes:

 In addition, Entergy Louisiana records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to: 
 
 changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of the River Bend decommissioning trust funds in 2024; 
 a decrease of 23.2 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in third quarter 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses.

 the repayment of 300 million of 5.59 Series mortgage bonds in December 2023; and 
 the repayment of 400 million of 5.40 Series mortgage bonds in April 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 22.6 for the third quarter 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes and the amortization of state accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of tax rate changes, partially offset by the book and tax differences related to the non-taxable income distributions earned on preferred membership interests and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items.

 The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 28.1 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to increased investment in the resilience of the distribution system. 
 
 Increases in Entergy Louisiana s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana s receivable from the money pool increased 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to increasing by 79.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Entergy Louisiana s financing activities used 340.5 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to providing 2,102.8 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the following activity:

 Decreases in Entergy Louisiana s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana s payable to the money pool decreased 156.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 226.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 See Note 4 to the financial statements herein and Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for more details on long-term debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the storm cost securitizations. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 Entergy Louisiana s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Louisiana is primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 46.1 44.9 Effect of subtracting cash (0.2 0.0 Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 45.9 44.9 
 
 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Louisiana s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 
 Uses and Sources of Capital 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Form 10-K for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana s uses and sources of capital. The following are updates to the information provided in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Entergy Louisiana is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates making 12.9 billion in capital investments during that period. In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the preliminary estimate includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Louisiana s portfolio, as well as to support customer growth, including Bayou Power Station and new generation resources in north Louisiana; investments in River Bend and Waterford 3; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

 Alternative RFP and Certification 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in March 2023, Entergy Louisiana made the first phase of a bifurcated filing to seek approval from the LPSC for an alternative to the requests for proposals (RFP) process that would enable the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources on a faster timeline than the current RFP and certification process allows. The initial phase of the filing established the need for the acquisition of additional resources and the need for an alternative to the RFP process. The second phase of the filing, which contains the details of the proposal for the alternative competitive procurement process and the information necessary to support certification, was filed in May 2023. In addition to the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources, the filing also seeks approval of a new renewable energy credits-based tariff, Rider Geaux ZERO . In May 2024 the LPSC voted to approve the application, and in June 2024 the LPSC issued an order reflecting that approval. In August 2024, Entergy Louisiana issued the first RFP pursuant to this order in solicitation of solar resources that meet the requirements of the LPSC s order. 
 
 Resilience and Grid Hardening 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in December 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking a public interest finding regarding Phase I of Entergy Louisiana s Future Ready resilience plan and approval of a rider mechanism to recover the program s costs. Phase I in the December 2022 application reflected the first five years of a ten-year resilience plan and included investment of approximately 5 billion, including hardening investment, transmission dead-end structures, enhanced vegetation management, and telecommunications improvement. In April 2024 the LPSC approved a framework which includes an initial five-year resilience plan providing for an investment of approximately 1.9 billion with cost recovery via a forward-looking rider with semi-annual true-ups. The plan is subject to specified reporting requirements and includes a performance review of the hardened assets. The LPSC order approving the framework does not include any restrictions on Entergy Louisiana s ability to file applications for approval of additional investments in resilience.

 Bayou Power Station 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Bayou Power Station, a 112 MW aggregated capacity floating natural gas power station with black-start capability in Leeville, Louisiana and an associated microgrid that would serve nearby areas, including Port Fourchon, Golden Meadow, Leeville, and Grand Isle. In its application, Entergy Louisiana noted that the estimated cost of the Bayou Power Station was 411 million, including estimated costs of transmission interconnection and other related costs. In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed a motion to suspend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to evaluate certain recent developments related to the project including potential changes to the estimated cost of the project. Entergy Louisiana will determine next steps for the project after fully evaluating these developments. Subject to timely approval by the LPSC and receipt of other permits and approvals, commercial operation is expected to occur by the end of 2028. 
 
 Additional Generation and Transmission Resources 
 
 In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking approval of a variety of generation and transmission resources proposed in connection with establishing service to a new customer facility in north Louisiana, for which an electric service agreement has been executed. The filing requests LPSC certification of three new combined cycle combustion turbine generation resources totaling 2,262 MW, each of which will be enabled for future carbon capture and storage, a new 500 kV transmission line, and 500 kV substation upgrades. The application also requests approval to implement a corporate sustainability rider applicable to the new customer. The corporate sustainability rider contemplates the new customer contributing to the costs of the future addition of 1,500 MW of new solar and energy storage resources, agreements involving carbon capture and storage at Entergy Louisiana s existing Lake Charles Power Station, and potential future wind and nuclear resources. The combined cost of the first two new generation resources is estimated to be approximately 2,387 million, and these units are expected to achieve commercial operation in 2028. The third new generation resource is currently expected to have an estimated cost similar to the first two new generation resources and is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2029. The cost of the new 500 kV transmission line is estimated to be 546 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates funding the incremental cost to serve the customer through direct financial contributions from the customer and the revenues it expects to earn under the electric service agreement. The application requests an LPSC decision by September 2025 in order to support the customer s schedule for taking electric service for the new facility. 
 
 Hurricane Francine 
 
 In September 2024, Hurricane Francine caused damage to the areas served by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, primarily due to damage to distribution infrastructure as a result of strong winds and heavy rain, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Louisiana s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Francine are currently estimated to be in the range of 185 million to 205 million. Entergy Louisiana is considering all available avenues to recover storm-related costs from Hurricane Francine, including accessing funded storm reserve escrows. Storm cost recovery or financing will be subject to review by applicable regulatory authorities. 
 
 Based on the historic treatment of such costs for similar storm events in the area served by Entergy Louisiana, management believes that recovery of restoration costs is probable. There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Because Entergy Louisiana has not gone through the regulatory process regarding these storm costs; however, there is an element of risk, and Entergy Louisiana is unable to predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing of such recovery.

 2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in August 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed an application for approval of a regulatory blueprint necessary for it to strengthen the electric grid for the State of Louisiana, which contains a dual-path request to update rates through either: (1) extension of Entergy Louisiana s current formula rate plan (with certain modifications) for three years (the Rate Mitigation Proposal), which is Entergy Louisiana s recommended path; or (2) implementation of rates resulting from a cost-of-service study (the Rate Case path). The application complies with Entergy Louisiana s previous formula rate plan extension order requiring that for Entergy Louisiana to obtain another extension of its formula rate plan that included a rate reset, Entergy Louisiana would need to submit a full cost-of-service rate case. Entergy Louisiana s filing supports the need to extend Entergy Louisiana s formula rate plan with credit supportive mechanisms needed to facilitate investment in the distribution, transmission, and generation functions. 
 
 A status conference was held in October 2023 at which a procedural schedule was adopted that included three technical conferences and a hearing in August 2024. In March 2024 the parties agreed to an eight-week extension of all deadlines to allow for continuation of settlement negotiations, and the ALJ issued an order with an amended procedural schedule. In July 2024 the parties agreed to extend further the procedural schedule to facilitate the continuation of settlement negotiations, with the hearing commencing in December 2024. 
 
 In July 2024, Entergy Louisiana reached an agreement in principle with the LPSC staff and the intervenors in the proceeding and filed with the LPSC a joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule to allow for all parties to finalize a stipulated settlement agreement. 
 
 In August 2024, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff jointly filed a global stipulated settlement agreement for consideration by the LPSC with key terms as follows: 
 
 continuation of the formula rate plan for 2024-2026 (test years 2023-2025); 
 a base formula rate plan revenue increase of 120 million for test year 2023, effective for rates beginning September 2024; 
 a 140 million cumulative cap on base formula rate plan revenue increases, if needed, for test years 2024 and 2025, excluding outside the bandwidth items;

 184 million of customer rate credits to be given over two years, including increasing customer sharing of income tax benefits resulting from the 2016-2018 IRS audit, to resolve any remaining disputed issues stemming from formula rate plan test years prior to test year 2023, including but not limited to the investigation into Entergy Services costs billed to Entergy Louisiana. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, a 38 million regulatory liability was recorded in 2023 in connection with the 2016-2018 IRS audit; 
 75.5 million of customer rate credits, as provided for in the System Energy global settlement, to be credited over three years subject to and conditioned upon FERC approval of the System Energy global settlement. See Complaints Against System Energy System Energy Settlement with the LPSC in Note 2 to the financial statements herein for further details of the System Energy global settlement; 
 5.8 million of customer rate credits provided for in the Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan global settlement agreement approved by the LPSC in November 2023 credited over one year. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for the discussion of the November 2023 Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan global settlement agreement; 
 an increase in the allowed midpoint return on common equity from 9.5 to 9.7 , with a bandwidth of 40 basis points above and below the midpoint, for the extended term of the formula rate plan, except that for test year 2023 in which the authorized return on common equity shall have no bearing on the change in base formula rate plan revenue described above and, for test year 2024, any earnings above the authorized return on common equity shall be returned to customers through a credit; 
 an increase in nuclear depreciation rates by 15 million in each of the 2023, 2024, and 2025 test years outside of the formula rate plan bandwidth calculation; and 
 for the transmission recovery mechanism and the distribution recovery mechanism, no change to the existing floors, but the caps for both would be 350 million for test year 2023, 375 million for test year 2024, and 400 million for test year 2025. Transmission projects filed with the LPSC will be exempt from the transmission recovery mechanism cap. 
 
 The global stipulated settlement agreement was unanimously approved by the LPSC in August 2024 and an order was issued by the LPSC in September 2024 reflecting the approval of the settlement. 
 
 Based on the July 2024 agreement in principle, in second quarter 2024 Entergy Louisiana recorded expenses of 151 million 111 million net-of-tax) primarily consisting of regulatory charges to reflect the effects of the agreement in principle. 
 
 2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In August 2024, pursuant to the global stipulated settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2023 calendar year operations. Consistent with the global stipulated settlement agreement, the filing reflected a 9.7 allowed return on common equity with a bandwidth of 40 basis points above and below the midpoint. For the 2023 test year, however, the bandwidth provisions of the formula rate plan are temporarily suspended and, pursuant to the terms of the global stipulated settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana implemented the September 2024 formula rate plan rate adjustments effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024. Those adjustments include a 120 million increase in base rider formula rate plan revenue and a 101.8 million one-time incremental net decrease consistent with the terms of the global stipulated settlement. The formula rate plan rate adjustments reflected in the evaluation report also include a redetermination of the transmission recovery mechanism, the distribution recovery mechanism, the additional capacity mechanism, the tax adjustment mechanism, the MISO cost recovery mechanism, and other one-time adjustments. Pursuant to the terms of the global stipulated settlement agreement, the review of the 2023 evaluation report shall be limited to these mechanisms and conducted under an expedited procedural schedule that provides a process for the parties to file and pursue resolution of any disputed issues by January 2025, after which any remaining disputed issues will be submitted to the ALJ for a contested proceeding and, ultimately, resolution by the LPSC.

 NRC Reactor Oversight Process 
 
 The NRC s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: licensee response column, or Column 1, regulatory response column, or Column 2, degraded cornerstone column, or Column 3, multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column, or Column 4, and unacceptable performance, or Column 5. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5. River Bend is currently in Column 1, and Waterford 3 is currently in Column 2. 
 
 In August 2024 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2, effective second quarter 2024, based on exceeding the threshold for reactor scrams in June 2024. Waterford 3 will remain in Column 2 until a supplemental inspection is satisfactorily completed.

 MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income increased 5.6 million primarily due to higher retail electric price, partially offset by lower volume/weather, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and higher taxes other than income taxes. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income increased 33.4 million primarily due to higher retail electric price, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes and higher interest expense. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 538.8 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (46.7) Volume/weather (11.0) Retail electric price 27.1 2024 operating revenues 508.2 
 
 Entergy Mississippi s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by an increase in weather-adjusted commercial usage. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan rates effective April 2024 and July 2024, including the implementation of the interim facilities rate adjustment effective over six months beginning in July 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the formula rate plan filings.

 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 1,396.4 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (79.3) Volume/weather (2.4) Retail electric price 51.2 2024 operating revenues 1,365.9 
 
 Entergy Mississippi s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage and the effect of less favorable weather on commercial sales. The decrease is substantially offset by an increase in weather-adjusted commercial usage and the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan rates effective April 2024 and July 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the formula rate plan filings.

 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 6.4 million in storm damage provisions. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of Entergy Mississippi s storm damage mitigation and restoration rider; 
 an increase of 1.3 million in contract costs related to operational performance, customer service, and organizational health initiatives; and 
 several individually insignificant items. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 3.9 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to the timing of vegetation maintenance costs . 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 4.7 million in contract costs related to operational performance, customer service, and organizational health initiatives; 
 an increase of 2.3 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity in 2024; 
 an increase of 2.3 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to the timing of recovery from customers; and

 The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 5.3 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to the timing of vegetation maintenance costs . 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes regulatory credits of 7.3 million, recorded in second quarter 2024, to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation reached in the 2024 formula rate plan filing proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the 2024 formula rate plan filing. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 300 million of 5.85 Series mortgage bonds in May 2024 and higher interest expense from carrying costs related to the deferred fuel balance, partially offset by the repayment of a 150 million unsecured term loan, of which 50 million was repaid in May 2023 and 100 million was repaid in December 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 25.0 for the third quarter 2024 and 24.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The differences in the effective income tax rates for the third quarter 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, partially offset by certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items.

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased 39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower fuel costs and a decrease of 11.3 million in pension contributions resulting from the timing of contributions in 2024 compared to 2023. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery; 
 the timing of payments to vendors; 
 lower collections from customers; and 
 an increase of 7 million in interest paid. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities increased 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 60.8 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to increased development in Entergy Mississippi s service area; 
 an increase of 45.3 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to higher spending on the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station project in 2024; and 
 money pool activity. 
 
 The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 a decrease of 33.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024; and 
 the substantial completion payment of approximately 30.4 million in April 2023 for the purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility by a consolidated tax equity partnership. See Note 14 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase. 
 
 Increases in Entergy Mississippi s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi s receivable from the money pool increased 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the repayment, prior to maturity, of 250 million of 3.10 Series mortgage bonds in June 2023 and the repayment, prior to maturity, in May 2023, of 50 million of an unsecured term loan due December 2023. The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the repayment, prior to maturity, of 100 million of 3.75 Series mortgage bonds in June 2024; 
 money pool activity; 
 a capital contribution of 25.7 million received in April 2023 from the noncontrolling tax equity investor in MS Sunflower Partnership, LLC and used by the partnership for payments in the acquisition of the

 Decreases in Entergy Mississippi s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi s payable to the money pool decreased 73.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to increasing by 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 Entergy Mississippi s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 50.9 50.5 Effect of subtracting cash (0.3 (0.1 Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 50.6 50.4 
 
 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Mississippi s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 
 Uses and Sources of Capital 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Form 10-K for a discussion of Entergy Mississippi s uses and sources of capital. The following are updates to the information provided in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Entergy Mississippi is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates making 3.7 billion in capital investments during that period. In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the preliminary estimate includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Mississippi s portfolio, as well as to support customer growth, including Delta Blues Advanced Power Station and additional solar generation; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

 Delta Blues Advanced Power Station 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Mississippi announced plans to construct, own, and operate the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, to be located in Washington County, Mississippi. The facility will primarily be powered by natural gas, and it will also be enabled with carbon capture and hydrogen co-firing optionality. The Delta Blues Advanced Power Station will cost an estimated 1.2 billion. State legislation passed in January 2024 provides for the pre-certification of construction for certain types of facilities that directly or indirectly provide electric service to customers with defined projects under the legislation. Construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station qualifies under this legislation for pre-certification. As enabled by this legislation, Entergy Mississippi began recovery of certain costs of construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station through the interim facilities rate adjustments provision of its formula rate plan rider, which rates became effective in July 2024. Non-fuel revenue collected from the facility s customer will be included in the formula rate plan to offset the facility s revenue requirement. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be in service by 2028.

 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2024 test year filing and 2023 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi s earned return on rate base for the historical 2023 calendar year to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2024 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2024 test year filing showed a 63.4 million rate increase was necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi s earned return on rate base to the specified point of adjustment of 7.10 , within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2023 look-back filing compared actual 2023 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflected no change in formula rate plan revenues. In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a 32.6 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2 of 2023 retail revenues, effective April 2024.

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 In December 2014 the MPSC ordered Entergy Mississippi to file an updated depreciation study at least once every four years. Pursuant to this order and Entergy Mississippi s filing cycle, Entergy Mississippi would have filed an updated depreciation report with its formula rate plan filing in 2023. However, in July 2022 the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to file its next depreciation study in connection with its 2024 formula rate plan filing notwithstanding the MPSC s prior order. Accordingly, Entergy Mississippi filed a depreciation study in February 2024. The study showed a need for an increase in annual depreciation expense of 55.2 million. The calculated increase in annual depreciation expense was excluded from Entergy Mississippi s 2024 formula rate plan revenue increase request because the MPSC had not yet approved the proposed depreciation rates. 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2024 test year filing, with the exception of immaterial adjustments to certain operation and maintenance expenses. After performance adjustments, the formula rate plan reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.08 for calendar year 2024, which resulted in a total revenue increase of 64.6 million for 2024. The joint stipulation also recommended approval of a revised customer charge of 31.82 per month for residential customers and 53.10 per month for general service customers. Pursuant to the stipulation, Entergy Mississippi s 2023 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.81 , resulting in an increase of 0.3 million in the formula rate plan revenues for 2023. Finally, the stipulation recommended approval of Entergy Mississippi s proposed depreciation rates with those rates to be implemented upon request and approval at a later date. In June 2024 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective in July 2024. The approval also included a reduction to the energy cost factor, resulting in a net bill decrease for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month. Also in June 2024, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of 7.3 million to reflect the difference between interim rates placed in effect in April 2024 and the rates reflected in the joint stipulation. 
 
 In May 2024, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC for formula rate plan revisions that were necessary for Entergy Mississippi to comply with state legislation passed in January 2024. The legislation allows Entergy Mississippi to make interim rate adjustments to recover the non-fuel related annual ownership cost of certain facilities that directly or indirectly provide service to customers who own certain data processing center projects as specified in the legislation. Entergy Mississippi filed the first of its annual interim facilities rate adjustment reports in May 2024 to recover approximately 8.7 million of these costs over a six-month period with rates effective beginning in July 2024. 
 
 Grand Gulf Capacity Filing 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Mississippi filed a notice of intent with the MPSC to implement revisions to its unit power cost recovery rider that would allow Entergy Mississippi to recover the first year of costs associated with the transfer of Entergy Louisiana s interest in and purchases of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the revised rider schedule, effective by January 1, 2025. This notice filing relates to the divestiture of Entergy Louisiana s 14 share of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and 2.43 share of capacity and energy from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff. This divestiture will be effectuated initially through Entergy Mississippi s purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a PPA governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies as described in the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC and Entergy Louisiana. See Complaints Against System Energy - System Energy Settlement with the LPSC in Note 2 to the financial statements herein for further details of the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC. In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi filed the proposed MSS-4 replacement PPA with the FERC. The parties requested that the MPSC and the FERC issue orders accepting the PPA no later than December 2024. 
 
 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 
 
 In June 2024 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation agreement between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff for Entergy Mississippi s 2024 formula rate plan filing. The 2024 formula rate plan filing included the conclusion of the modified interim adjustments to Entergy Mississippi s energy cost

 recovery rider and power management rider, which were approved in October 2022 and allowed Entergy Mississippi to recover certain under-collected fuel balances. The stipulation provided for Entergy Mississippi to reduce its net energy cost factor. See Filings with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi) - Retail Rates - 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing in Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the 2024 formula rate plan filing and the joint stipulation agreement. 
 
 Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, Entergy Mississippi had approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage provision of 1.75 million per month. If Entergy Mississippi s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeded 15 million, the collection of the storm damage provision ceased until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision became less than 10 million. 
 
 In December 2023, Entergy Mississippi filed a Notice of Storm Escrow Disbursement and Request for Interim Relief notifying the MPSC that Entergy Mississippi had requested disbursement of approximately 34.5 million of storm escrow funds from its restricted storm escrow account. The filing also requested authorization from the MPSC, on a temporary basis, that the 34.5 million of storm escrow funds be credited to Entergy Mississippi s storm damage provision, pending the MPSC s review of Entergy Mississippi s storm-related costs, and that Entergy Mississippi continue to bill its monthly storm damage provision without suspension in the event the storm damage provision balance exceeds 15 million, in anticipation of a subsequent filing by Entergy Mississippi in this proceeding. The storm damage reserve exceeded 15 million upon receipt of the storm escrow funds. Because the MPSC had not entered an order on Entergy Mississippi s filing on the requested relief to continue billing this provision, Entergy Mississippi suspended billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with February 2024 bills. 
 
 In March 2024, Entergy Mississippi made a combined dual filing which included a Notice of Intent to Make Routine Change in Rates and Schedules and a Motion for Determination relating to the above-described Notice of Storm Escrow Disbursement. The Notice of Intent proposed a new storm damage mitigation and restoration rider to supersede both the current storm damage rate schedule and the vegetation management rider schedule, in which the collection of both expenses would be combined. The proposal requests that the MPSC authorize Entergy Mississippi to collect a storm damage provision of 5.2 million per month. Furthermore, if Entergy Mississippi s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeds 70 million , collection of the storm damage provision would cease until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision becomes less than 60 million. 
 
 The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff reviewed the storm-related costs submitted by Entergy Mississippi and found them prudent. In June 2024 the MPSC considered and unanimously granted the relief sought by Entergy Mississippi, including authorization to credit any remaining funds in the storm escrow account to Entergy Mississippi s storm damage reserve and to close the storm escrow account. Entergy Mississippi s storm escrow account was liquidated in July 2024, and t he new combined storm damage mitigation and restoration rider became effective with the July 2024 billing cycle. Additionally, Entergy Mississippi made a compliance filing to cease billing under the existing vegetation management rider schedule as of the same billing cycle.

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 4.4 million primarily due to lower volume/weather, partially offset by lower other operation and maintenance expenses. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 56.3 million primarily due to a 78.5 million 57.4 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge, recorded in first quarter 2024, primarily to reflect a settlement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council in April 2024 for additional sharing with customers of income tax benefits from the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit. Also contributing to the decrease were higher other operation and maintenance expenses . The decrease was partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate. See Note 10 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the April 2024 settlement in principle and Note 3 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 254.3 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income (13.4) Volume/weather (9.8) Retail electric price 1.4 2024 operating revenues 232.5 
 
 Entergy New Orleans s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective September 2023 in accordance with the terms of the 2023 formula rate plan filing. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the formula rate plan filing.

 Other Income Statement Variances 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of 2.7 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2024 as compared to 2023 and the timing of vegetation maintenance costs. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of 35 million of 6.25 Series mortgage bonds, 65 million of 6.41 Series mortgage bonds, and 50 million of 6.54 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024, partially offset by the repayment of an 85 million unsecured term loan in June 2024. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 an increase of 2.4 million in bad debt expense; 
 an increase of 2.2 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to higher energy efficiency costs ; 
 an increase of 2.2 million in contract costs related to operational performance, customer service, and organizational health initiatives; and 
 an increase of 1.4 million in costs recognized related to credits provided to customers as part of the rate mitigation plan approved in the settlement of the 2023 formula rate plan filing. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the formula rate plan filing. 
 
 Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes as a result of lower retail revenues in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes a regulatory charge of 78.5 million, recorded in first quarter 2024, primarily to reflect a settlement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council in April 2024 for additional sharing with customers of income tax benefits from the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS

 Other income decreased primarily due to lower interest earned on money pool investments, partially offset by a decrease of 2.5 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses. See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Form 10-K, Note 6 to the financial statements herein, and Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of 35 million of 6.25 Series mortgage bonds, 65 million of 6.41 Series mortgage bonds, and 50 million of 6.54 Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of 100 million of 3.90 Series mortgage bonds in July 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 27.0 for the third quarter 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 18.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, the amortization of state accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of a tax rate change, the amortization of investment tax credits, and book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction , partially offset by the accrual for state income taxes. 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 27.3 for the third quarter 2023 and 28.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The differences in the effective income tax rates for the third quarter 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes.

 proposed transaction. In September 2024 the hearing officer certified the record of the proceeding for City Council consideration. A decision is targeted for first quarter 2025. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flow 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 26 4,464 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 123,928 185,632 Investing activities (124,564) 1,914 Financing activities 35,123 (77,203) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 34,487 110,343 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 34,513 114,807 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 61.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the refund of 34 million received from System Energy in January 2023 related to the sale-leaseback renewal costs and depreciation litigation as calculated in System Energy s January 2023 compliance report filed with the FERC and lower collections from customers. The decrease was partially offset by lower fuel payments in 2024 as compared to 2023 . See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the refund and the related proceedings. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Entergy New Orleans s investing activities used 124.6 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to providing 1.9 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to money pool activity and a decrease of 14.7 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to higher spending in 2023 related to Entergy New Orleans s construction of the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board Sullivan substation. 
 
 Increases in Entergy New Orleans s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans s receivable from the money pool increased 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 135.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities 
 
 Entergy New Orleans s financing activities provided 35.1 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to using 77.2 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the following activity: 
 
 the issuances of 35 million of 6.25 Series mortgage bonds, 65 million of 6.41 Series mortgage bonds, and 50 million of 6.54 mortgage bonds, each in May 2024; 
 the repayment, at maturity, of 100 million of 3.90 Series mortgage bonds in July 2023; 
 a 15 million advance received in 2023 related to Entergy New Orleans s construction of the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board Sullivan substation; 
 money pool activity; and 
 the repayment, at maturity, of an 85 million unsecured term loan in June 2024 as compared to additional borrowings of 15 million on the unsecured term loan in May 2023. 
 
 Decreases in Entergy New Orleans s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans s payable to the money pool decreased 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 Entergy New Orleans s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy New Orleans is primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 47.6 45.8 Effect of excluding securitization bonds (0.2 Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 47.6 45.6 Effect of subtracting cash (1.2 Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 46.4 45.6 
 
 (a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans. 
 
 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable due to an associated company. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures. Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K. Entergy New Orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

 Resilience and Grid Hardening 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2021 the City Council passed a resolution and order establishing a docket and procedural schedule with respect to system resiliency and storm hardening. In July 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council a response identifying a preliminary plan for storm hardening and resiliency projects, including microgrids, to be implemented over ten years at an approximate cost of 1.5 billion. In February 2023 the City Council approved a revised procedural schedule requiring Entergy New Orleans to make a filing in April 2023 containing a narrowed list of proposed hardening projects. In April 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed the required application and supporting testimony seeking City Council approval of the first phase (five years and 559 million) of a ten-year infrastructure hardening plan totaling approximately 1 billion. Entergy New Orleans also sought, among other relief, City Council approval of a rider to recover from customers the costs of the infrastructure hardening plan. In February 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to implement a resilience project to be partially funded by 55 million of matching funding through the DOE s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program. The resolution also required Entergy New Orleans to submit, no later than July 2024, a revised resilience plan consisting of projects over a three-year period. In March 2024, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council for approval the requested three-year resilience plan, which includes 168 million in hardening projects. The three-year resilience plan is in addition to the previously authorized resilience project to be partially funded by the DOE s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program. In July 2024 the City Council held a technical conference regarding Entergy New Orleans s three-year resilience plan. In October 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing a two-year resilience plan

totaling 100 million. The resolution directs Entergy New Orleans to notify the City Council of the subset of hardening projects from the revised three-year resilience plan to be included in the two-year resilience plan. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS State and Local Rate Regulation in the Form 10-K for a discussion of state and local rate regulation. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Retail Rates 
 
 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing 
 
 In April 2024, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2023 test year filing. Without the requested rate change in 2024, the 2023 test year evaluation report produced an electric earned return on equity of 8.66 and a gas earned return on equity of 5.87 compared to the authorized return on equity for each of 9.35 . Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a 12.6 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case and approved again by the City Council in 2023. The formula would result in an increase in authorized electric revenues of 7.0 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of 5.6 million. Following City Council review, the City Council s advisors issued a report in July 2024 seeking a reduction in Entergy New Orleans s requested formula rate plan revenues in an aggregate amount of approximately 1.6 million for electric and gas together due to alleged errors. Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation. The total formula rate plan increase implemented was 11.2 million, which includes an increase of 5.8 million in electric revenues and an increase of 5.4 million in gas revenues. 
 
 Reliability Investigation 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in August 2017 the City Council established a docket to investigate the reliability of the Entergy New Orleans distribution system and to consider implementing certain reliability standards and possible financial penalties for not meeting any such standards. In April 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to demonstrate that it has been prudent in the management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system. The City Council also approved a resolution that opened a prudence investigation into whether Entergy New Orleans was imprudent for not acting sooner to address outages in New Orleans and whether fines should be imposed. In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed testimony in response to the prudence investigation asserting that it had been prudent in managing system reliability. In April 2019 the City Council advisors filed comments and testimony asserting that Entergy New Orleans did not act prudently in maintaining and improving its distribution system reliability in recent years and recommending that a financial penalty in the range of 1.5 million to 2 million should be assessed. Entergy New Orleans disagreed with the recommendation and submitted rebuttal testimony and rebuttal comments in June 2019. In November 2019 the City Council passed a resolution that penalized Entergy New Orleans 1 million for alleged imprudence in the maintenance of its distribution system. In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed suit in Louisiana state court seeking judicial review of the City Council s resolution. In June 2022 the Orleans Civil District Court issued a written judgment that the penalty be set aside, reversed, and vacated. In August 2022 the Orleans Civil District Court issued written reasons for its judgment and also granted a post-judgment motion to remand for the City Council to take actions consistent with its judgment. 
 
 In April 2023 the City Council approved a resolution that established a procedural schedule to allow for the submission of additional evidence regarding the penalty imposed in 2019. In May 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed with the Orleans Civil District Court a petition for judicial review and (or alternatively) declaratory judgment of, together with a request for injunctive relief from, the City Council s April 2023 resolution. In June 2023 the City

 Council filed exceptions requesting the Orleans Civil District Court dismiss the suit as premature, and a hearing date was set on the exceptions. In September 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed an unopposed motion to continue the hearing on the City Council s exceptions without date, which was granted. In May 2024 the City Council approved a settlement in which Entergy New Orleans agreed to 500 thousand in unrecovered distribution investment and will recover all verifiable regulatory costs associated with any reliability-related investigation, as well as any costs associated with the judicial reviews. In June 2024, Entergy New Orleans filed with the Orleans Civil District Court an unopposed motion to dismiss with prejudice and an order regarding its petition for judicial review. In July 2024 the dismissal order was signed. 
 
 Renewable Portfolio Standard Rulemaking 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in May 2021 the City Council established the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard. In May 2023, Entergy New Orleans submitted its compliance demonstration report to the City Council for the 2022 compliance year, which describes and demonstrates Entergy New Orleans s compliance with the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard in 2022 and satisfies certain informational requirements. Entergy New Orleans requested, among other things, that the City Council determine that Entergy New Orleans achieved the target under the portfolio standard for 2022 and remains within the customer protection cost cap, and that the City Council approve a proposal to recover costs associated with 2022 compliance. In April 2024 the City Council approved a resolution finding Entergy New Orleans was in compliance with the 2022 requirements and that Entergy New Orleans did not exceed the customer protection cost cap, as well as approving Entergy New Orleans s proposal to recover costs. 
 
 Income Tax Audits 
 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K, in November 2023 the IRS completed its examination of the 2016 through 2018 tax years and issued a Revenue Agent Report for each federal filer under audit. Based on prior regulatory agreements and general rate-making principles, in fourth quarter 2023 Entergy New Orleans recorded a regulatory liability and associated regulatory charge of 60 million 44 million net-of-tax). In April 2024, Entergy New Orleans and the City Council entered into a settlement in principle whereby Entergy New Orleans agreed to share with customers 138 million of income tax benefits from the resolution of the 2016 2018 IRS audit. Based on this settlement in principle, in first quarter 2024, Entergy New Orleans increased the associated regulatory liability from 60 million to 138 million and recorded a corresponding 78 million regulatory charge 57 million net-of-tax). The settlement in principle requires that the regulatory liability be amortized over 25 years with the unamortized balance included in rate base and the amortization treated as a reduction to Entergy New Orleans s retail revenue requirement. In May 2024 the City Council approved the settlement.

 MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 31.8 million primarily due to lower volume/weather. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 34.9 million primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher other income. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023: 
 Amount (In Millions) 2023 operating revenues 616.6 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income 12.7 Volume/weather (33.7) Retail electric price 1.4 2024 operating revenues 597.0 
 
 Entergy Texas s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income includes the revenue variance associated with these items. 
 
 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and a decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage. The decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage is primarily due to the effects of Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter 2024. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is insignificant and primarily due to the effect on unbilled revenue resulting from the implementation of the distribution cost recovery factor rider effective with the first billing cycle in October 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the distribution cost recovery factor rider filing.

 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales and a decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage. The decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage is primarily due to the effects of Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter 2024. 
 
 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates effective June 2023, partially offset by the implementation of the generation cost recovery relate-back rider for the Hardin County Peaking Facility effective over three months beginning in May 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2022 base rate case and the generation cost recovery rider filings.

 Other Income Statement Variances 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of 5.8 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to the timing of vegetation maintenance costs. 
 
 Other regulatory charges (credits) - net includes the reversal in third quarter 2023 of 21.9 million of regulatory liabilities to reflect the recognition of certain receipts by Entergy Texas under affiliated PPAs that have been resolved. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2022 base rate case. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 350 million of 5.55 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024 and the issuance of 350 million of 5.80 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 a gain of 6.9 million on the partial sale of a service center in April 2023 as part of an eminent domain proceeding; 
 an increase of 5.2 million in contract costs related to operational performance, customer service, and organizational health initiatives; 
 an increase of 3.9 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity in 2024 ; 
 an increase of 3.8 million in bad debt expense; 
 an increase of 3.7 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 
 an increase of 3.2 million in storm damage provisions .

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to: 
 
 the recognition of 27.6 million in depreciation expense in 2024 for the 2022 base rate case relate back period, effective over six months beginning January 2024. The recognition of depreciation expense for the relate back period is effective over the same period as collections from the relate back surcharge rider and results in no effect on net income; 
 additions to plant in service; and 
 an increase in depreciation rates effective with an increase in base rates in June 2023. 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2022 base rate case.

See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the 2022 base rate case. 
 
 Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project, and higher interest earned on money pool investments . The increase was partially offset by an increase of 5 million in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit non-service costs as a result of an increase in amortizations of the previously deferred surplus and deferrals of the deficit in the annual amount of actuarially determined pension and other postretirement benefits chargeable under the Entergy Texas reserve. See Note 11 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the Entergy Texas reserve. 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 350 million of 5.80 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023 and the issuance of 350 million of 5.55 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project. 
 
 I ncome Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 18.8 for the third quarter 2024 and 18.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The differences in the effective income tax rates for the third quarter 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items. 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 20.1 for the third quarter 2023 and 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The differences in the effective income tax rates for the third quarter 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flow 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 21,986 3,497 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 550,819 498,457 Investing activities (576,495) (608,945) Financing activities 357,333 357,787 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 331,657 247,299 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 353,643 250,796 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased 52.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower fuel and purchased power costs, the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, and a decrease of 23.7 million in income taxes paid in 2024 as a result of lower estimated income tax payments in comparison to 2023. The increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the timing of payments to vendors; 
 lower collections from customers; and 
 an increase of 46 million in interest paid. 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased 32.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to money pool activity. The decrease was partially offset by: 
 
 an increase of 100 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Texas s service area and increased spending on various transmission projects in 2024; and 
 an increase of 83.9 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024 and higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Texas s service area. The increase in storm restoration expenditures is primarily due to Hurricane Beryl restoration efforts in 2024. 
 
 Decreases in Entergy Texas s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas s receivable from the money pool decreased 280.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 73.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements,

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by financing activities decreased 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the issuance of 350 million of 5.80 Series mortgage bonds in August 2023 and other insignificant activity, substantially offset by the issuance of 350 million of 5.55 Series mortgage bonds in August 2024. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 Entergy Texas s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt to capital 51.5 50.9 Effect of excluding securitization bonds (1.8 (2.1 Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 49.7 48.8 Effect of subtracting cash (2.8 (0.2 Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 46.9 48.6 
 
 (a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas. 
 
 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of finance lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures. Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K. Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Texas s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 
 Uses and Sources of Capital 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Form 10-K for a discussion of Entergy Texas s uses and sources of capital. The following are updates to the information provided in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Entergy Texas is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates making 4.8 billion in capital investments during that period. In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the preliminary estimate includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Texas s portfolio, including Orange County Advanced Power Station, Lone Star Power Station, Segno Solar, and Votaw Solar; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

 Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of 300 million scheduled to expire in June 2029. The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against 30 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were no cash borrowings and 1.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, Entergy Texas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of September 30, 2024, 86.4 million in letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Texas s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein for additional discussion of the credit facilities. 
 
 Legend Power Station and Lone Star Power Station 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Legend Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled with both carbon capture and storage and hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Jefferson County, Texas, and the Lone Star Power Station, a 453 MW simple-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled with hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Liberty County, Texas. In its application, Entergy Texas noted that the Legend Power Station was expected to cost an estimated 1.46 billion and the Lone Star Power Station was expected to cost an estimated 735.3 million, in each case inclusive of the estimated costs of the generation facilities, interconnection costs, transmission network upgrades, and an allowance for funds used during construction. As described in the application, Entergy Texas is considering alternative financing approaches for the Legend Power Station and plans to pursue the financing option that is in the best interest of its customers. In July 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and, also in July 2024, the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled to begin in October 2024. In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed, and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted, a motion to extend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to address certain developments relating to the cost and scope of the Legend Power Station and the Lone Star Power Station. As soon as the required information is developed, Entergy Texas plans to update the economic analyses in the application for both projects and to file a proposed updated procedural schedule. Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, both facilities are expected to be in service by mid-2028. 
 
 Segno Solar and Votaw Solar 
 
 In July 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Segno Solar facility, a 170 MW solar facility to be located in Polk County, Texas, and the Votaw Solar facility, a 141 MW solar facility to be located in Hardin County, Texas. The Segno Solar facility will cost an estimated 351.6 million, and the Votaw Solar facility will cost an estimated 303.8 million, in each case inclusive of estimated transmission interconnection and upgrade costs. In September 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted an agreed procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits to be held in March 2025. A PUCT decision is expected in third quarter 2025. Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, the Segno Solar facility is expected to be in service by early 2027, and the Votaw Solar facility is expected to be in service by mid-2028.

Resilience and Grid Hardening 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT requesting approval of Phase I of its Texas Future Ready Resiliency Plan, a cost-effective set of measures to begin accelerating the resiliency of Entergy Texas s transmission and distribution system. Phase I is comprised of projects totaling approximately 335.1 million, including approximately 198 million of projects contingent upon Entergy Texas s receipt of grant funds in that amount from the Texas Energy Fund. The projects in Phase I include distribution and transmission hardening and modernization projects and targeted vegetation management projects to mitigate the risk of wildfire. These projects are expected to be implemented within approximately three years of PUCT approval. The PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings in June 2024. In July 2024, Entergy Texas filed a motion, on behalf of the parties to the proceeding, requesting the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopt an agreed proposed procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled for September 2024. The ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted the agreed procedural schedule in August 2024. In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed, on behalf of the parties to the proceeding, and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted, an unopposed motion to abate the procedural schedule, including the hearing on the merits, noting the parties had reached a settlement in principle and to allow the parties time to finalize a settlement agreement. In October 2024, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement that would resolve all issues in the proceeding, supporting testimony, and a motion to admit evidence and remand the proceeding to the PUCT. Also in October 2024, the PUCT staff filed testimony in support of the unopposed settlement. A PUCT decision is expected in fourth quarter 2024. 
 
 Hurricane Beryl 
 
 In July 2024, Hurricane Beryl caused extensive damage to Entergy Texas s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, as a result of extensive debris and damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Texas s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Beryl are currently estimated to be approximately 85 million. Based on the historic treatment of such costs in Entergy Texas s service area, management believes that recovery of restoration costs is probable. There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these catastrophic events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. Entergy Texas expects to recover the majority of the restoration costs associated with Hurricane Beryl through its transmission and distribution cost recovery factor riders. 

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery in the Form 10-K for a discussion of state and local rate regulation and fuel-cost recovery. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Retail Rates 
 
 2022 Base Rate Case 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in August 2023 the PUCT issued an order severing issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the 2022 base rate case proceeding to a separate proceeding. In December 2023 the PUCT referred the separate proceeding to resolve the issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. A hearing on the merits was held in April 2024. In June 2024 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued a proposal for decision concluding that it is appropriate for a vertically integrated electric utility, and Entergy Texas specifically, to own vehicle-charging facilities or other transportation electrification and charging infrastructure and recommending that both of Entergy Texas s proposed

 transportation electrification riders be approved. In October 2024 the PUCT issued an order concluding that it is appropriate for Entergy Texas to own transportation electrification and charging infrastructure, including charging stations, and approving both of Entergy Texas s proposed transportation electrification riders with a limitation that Entergy Texas s infrastructure rider be applied only to publicly-available charging infrastructure and Entergy Texas not recover any outstanding fees from customers not taking service under the rider. 
 
 Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider 
 
 In June 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF rider. The new rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas s retail customers approximately 40.3 million annually based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2022 and March 31, 2024. In September 2024, the PUCT approved the DCRF rider, consistent with Entergy Texas s as-filed request, and rates became effective with the first billing cycle in October 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas s retail customers approximately 48.9 million annually, or 8.6 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas s currently effective DCRF rider based on its capital invested in distribution between April 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024. In October 2024 the PUCT staff filed a recommendation that the PUCT approve Entergy Texas s as-filed application. A PUCT decision is expected in fourth quarter 2024. 
 
 Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider 
 
 In October 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider. The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas s retail customers approximately 9.7 million annually based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 and changes in other transmission charges. Entergy Texas requested that the PUCT issue a decision in fourth quarter 2024, unless a hearing on the merits is requested. 
 
 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 
 
 In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2022 through March 2024. During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately 1.6 billion in eligible fuel and purchased power expenses to generate and purchase electricity to serve its customers, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments. Entergy Texas s cumulative under-recovery balance for the reconciliation period was approximately 30 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as part of the cumulative fuel balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2024.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC. 
 
 MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

System Energy s principal asset consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90 interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90 interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy s only source of operating revenues. As discussed in Complaints Against System Energy below and in Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, System Energy and the Unit Power Sales Agreement are currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC (or on appeal from the FERC to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit). 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 1.6 million primarily due to the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy Arkansas effective with the November 2023 service month per the settlement agreement with the APSC and the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy New Orleans effective with the June 2024 service month per the settlement agreement with the City Council, substantially offset by an increase in operating revenues resulting from changes in rate base. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the settlement with the City Council. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income increased 1 million primarily due to an increase in operating revenues resulting from changes in rate base, partially offset by the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy Arkansas effective with the November 2023 service month per the settlement agreement with the APSC and the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy New Orleans effective with the June 2024 service month per the settlement agreement with the City Council. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the settlement with the City Council. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 24 for the third quarter 2024 and 22.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The differences in the effective income tax rates for the third quarter 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to the accrual for state income taxes, partially offset by book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction. 
 
 The effective income tax rates were 22.5 for the third quarter 2023 and 22.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Cash Flow 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 60 2,940 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 113,280 155,190 Investing activities (241,229) (27,165) Financing activities 206,084 (35,172) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 78,135 92,853 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 78,195 95,793 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased 41.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 the refund of 92.7 million made in 2024 to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the settlement with the APSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein and in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement with the APSC; 
 an increase of 21.2 million in spending on nuclear refueling outage costs in 2024 as compared to 2023; and 
 the timing of collection of receivables. 
 
 The decrease was partially offset by: 
 
 aggregate refunds of 103.5 million made in January 2023 related to the sale-leaseback renewal costs and depreciation litigation as calculated in System Energy s January 2023 compliance report filed with the FERC. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for further discussion of the refunds and the related proceedings; and 
 refunds of 19.3 million included in May 2023 service month bills under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to reflect the effects of the partial settlement agreement approved by the FERC in April 2023.

 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flow used in investing activities increased 214.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: 
 
 money pool activity; 
 an increase in cash used of 85.8 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and 
 an increase of 43.5 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to higher spending in 2024 on Grand Gulf outage projects and upgrades. 
 
 Increases in System Energy s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow and System Energy s receivable from the money pool increased 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to decreasing by 85.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries dependence on external short-term borrowings. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 System Energy s financing activities provided 206.1 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to using 35.2 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the following activity: 
 
 the repayment, at maturity, of 250 million of 4.10 Series mortgage bonds in April 2023; 
 a capital contribution of 150 million received from Entergy Corporation in January 2024 in order to maintain System Energy s capital structure; 
 net long-term borrowings of 68.5 million in 2024 compared to net repayments of 43.4 million in 2023 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity s credit facility; 
 the repayment, prior to maturity, in March 2023 of a 50 million term loan due in November 2023; 
 the issuance of 325 million of 6.00 Series mortgage bonds in March 2023; and 
 money pool activity. 
 
 Decreases in System Energy s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy s payable to the money pool decreased 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 See Note 4 to the financial statements herein and Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for more details on long-term debt. 
 
 Capital Structure 
 
 System Energy s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital ratio for System Energy is primarily due to the capital contribution of 150 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2024, partially offset by the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024.

 Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy s financial condition because net debt indicates System Energy s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
 
 Uses and Sources of Capital 
 
 See MANAGEMENT S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Form 10-K for a discussion of System Energy s uses and sources of capital. The following are updates to the information provided in the Form 10-K. 
 
 System Energy is developing its capital investment plan for 2025 through 2027 and currently anticipates making 385 million in capital investments during that period. The preliminary estimate includes amounts associated with Grand Gulf investments and initiatives.

 Complaints Against System Energy 
 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for information regarding pending complaints against System Energy. System Energy and the Unit Power Sales Agreement are currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC (or on appeal from the FERC to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit) , including challenges with respect to System Energy s authorized return on equity and capital structure, renewal of its sale-leaseback arrangement, treatment of uncertain tax positions, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and two prudence complaints, one challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period, and the second challenging the operation and management of Grand Gulf in the 2021-2022 time period. S ettlements that resolve all significant aspects of these complaints have been reached with the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council and approved by the FERC. A settlement has been reached with the LPSC and is pending FERC approval, as described in System Energy Settlement with the LPSC below. If the settlement with the

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 LPSC is approved by the FERC, it would resolve all significant aspects of these pending complaints. The following are updates to the discussion in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Return on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in March 2021 the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision in the proceeding initiated by the LPSC, the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council against System Energy regarding the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. With regard to System Energy s authorized return on equity, the ALJ determined that the existing return on equity of 10.94 is no longer just and reasonable, and that the replacement authorized return on equity, based on application of the FERC s Opinion No. 569-A methodology, should be 9.32 . The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (January 2017-April 2018) based on the difference between the current return on equity and the replacement authorized return on equity. The ALJ determined that the April 2018 complaint concerning the authorized return on equity should be dismissed, and that no refunds for a second fifteen-month refund period should be due. With regard to System Energy s capital structure, the ALJ determined that System Energy s actual equity ratio is excessive and that the just and reasonable equity ratio is 48.15 equity, based on the average equity ratio of the proxy group used to evaluate the return on equity for the second complaint. The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (September 2018-December 2019) based on the difference between the actual equity ratio and the 48.15 equity ratio. If the ALJ s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this proceeding is approximately 11.6 million, which includes interest through September 30, 2024, and the estimated resulting annual rate reduction would be approximately 6.8 million. As a result of the settlement agreements with the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council, the estimated refund and rate reduction only includes the portion related to Entergy Louisiana, whose settlement with the LPSC is pending FERC approval. See System Energy Settlement with the MPSC in the Form 10-K, see System Energy Settlement with the APSC below and in the Form 10-K, and see System Energy Settlement with the City Council below for discussion of the settlements. The estimated refund will continue to accrue interest until a final FERC decision is issued. 
 
 The ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process , and an ALJ s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on the FERC . In April 2021, System Energy filed its brief on exceptions, in which it challenged the initial decision s findings on both the return on equity and capital structure issues. Also in April 2021 the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions. Reply briefs opposing exceptions were filed in May 2021 by System Energy, the FERC trial staff, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council. Refunds, if any, that might be required will only become due after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial decision. 
 
 In August 2022 the D.C. Circuit issued an order addressing appeals of FERC s Opinion No. 569 and 569-A, which established the methodology applied in the ALJ s initial decision in the proceeding against System Energy discussed above and in the Form 10-K. The appellate order addressed the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO. The D.C. Circuit found the FERC s use of the risk premium model as part of the methodology to be arbitrary and capricious and remanded the case back to the FERC. In October 2024 the FERC issued a remand order in the MISO transmission owners case, concluding that the record supported the methodology that it originally directed in Opinion No. 569 utilizing an equal weighting of the two-step discounted cash flow model and capital asset pricing model. As a result, it determined that the just and reasonable return on equity for the MISO transmission owners is 9.98 . In light of the System Energy settlements described below, the FERC s changes to its return on equity methodology in the decision on the MISO transmission owners return on equity will not have any immediate effect on System Energy s return on equity because System Energy s return on equity is locked-in through the end of June 2026.

 Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy Services related to System Energy s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in December 1988 for an 11.5 undivided interest in Grand Gulf Unit 1. The APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council subsequently intervened in the proceeding. A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ issued the initial decision, and in December 2022 the FERC issued an order on the ALJ s initial decision, which affirmed it in part and modified it in part. The FERC s order directed System Energy to calculate refunds on three issues, and to provide a compliance report detailing the calculations. The FERC s order also disallows the future recovery of sale-leaseback renewal costs, which is estimated at approximately 11.5 million annually for purchases from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans through July 2036. The three refund issues are rental expenses related to the renewal of the sale-leaseback arrangements; refunds, if any, for the revenue requirement impact of including accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax positions from 2004 through the present; and refunds for the net effect of correcting the depreciation inputs for capital additions attributable to the portion of plant subject to the sale-leaseback. 
 
 In January 2023, System Energy filed its compliance report with the FERC. With respect to the sale-leaseback renewal costs, System Energy calculated a refund of 89.8 million, which represented all of the sale-leaseback renewal rental costs that System Energy recovered in rates, with interest. With respect to the decommissioning uncertain tax position issue, System Energy calculated that no additional refunds are owed because it had already provided a one-time historical credit (for the period January 2016 through September 2020) of 25.2 million based on the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position, and because it has been providing an ongoing rate base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position since October 2020. With respect to the depreciation refund, System Energy calculated a refund of 13.7 million, which is the net total of a refund to customers for excess depreciation expense previously collected, plus interest, offset by the additional return on rate base that System Energy previously did not collect, without interest. 
 
 In January 2023, System Energy filed a request for rehearing of the FERC s determinations in the December 2022 order on sale-leaseback refund issues and future lease cost disallowances, the FERC s prospective policy on uncertain tax positions, and the proper accounting of System Energy s accumulated deferred income taxes adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and a motion for confirmation of its interpretation of the December 2022 order s remedy concerning the decommissioning tax position. In January 2023 the retail regulators filed a motion for confirmation of their interpretation of the refund requirement in the December 2022 FERC order and a provisional request for rehearing. In February 2023 the FERC issued a notice that the rehearing requests have been deemed denied by operation of law. The deemed denial of the rehearing request initiated a sixty-day period in which aggrieved parties could petition for federal appellate court review of the underlying FERC orders; however, the FERC may issue a substantive order on rehearing as long as it continues to have jurisdiction over the case. In March 2023, System Energy filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit a petition for review of the December 2022 order. In March 2023, System Energy also filed an unopposed motion to stay the proceeding in the Fifth Circuit pending the FERC s disposition of the pending motions, and the court granted the motion to stay. 
 
 In August 2023 the FERC issued an order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and partially setting aside the prior order (rehearing order). The rehearing order addresses rehearing requests that were filed in January 2023 separately by System Energy and the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council. 
 
 In the rehearing order, the FERC directs System Energy to recalculate refunds for two issues: (1) refunds of rental expenses related to the renewal of the sale-leaseback arrangements and (2) refunds for the net effect of correcting the depreciation inputs for capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback. With regard to the sale-leaseback renewal rental expenses, the rehearing order allows System Energy to recover an implied return of and on the depreciated cost of the portion of the plant subject to the sale-leaseback as of the expiration of the initial lease

 term. With regard to the depreciation input issue, the rehearing order allows System Energy to offset refunds so that System Energy may collect interest on the rate base recalculations that were part of the overall depreciation rate recalculations. The rehearing order further directs System Energy to submit within 60 days of the date of the rehearing order an additional compliance filing to revise the total refunds for these two issues. As discus sed above , System Energy s January 2023 compliance filing calculated 103.5 million in total refunds, and the refunds were paid in January 2023. In October 2023, System Energy filed its compliance report with the FERC as directed in the August 2023 rehearing order. The October 2023 compliance report reflected recalculated refunds totaling 35.7 million for the two issues resulting in 67.8 million in refunds that could be recouped by System Energy. As discussed below in System Energy Settlement with the APSC , System Energy reached a settlement in principle with the APSC to resolve several pending cases under the FERC s jurisdiction, including this one, pursuant to which it has agreed not to recoup the 27.3 million calculated for Entergy Arkansas in the compliance filing. Consistent with the compliance filing, in October 2023, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans paid recoupment amounts of 18.2 million and 22.3 million, respectively, to System Energy. 
 
 On the third refund issue identified in the rehearing requests, concerning the decommissioning uncertain tax positions, the rehearing order denied all rehearing requests, re-affirmed the remedy contained in the December 2022 order, and did not direct System Energy to recalculate refunds or to submit an additional compliance filing. On this issue, as reflected in its January 2023 compliance filing, System Energy believes it has already paid the refunds due under the remedy that the FERC outlined for the uncertain tax positions issue in its December 2022 order. In August 2023 the LPSC issued a media release in which it stated that it disagrees with System Energy s determination that the rehearing order requires no further refunds to be made on this issue. 
 
 In September 2023, System Energy filed a protective appeal of the rehearing order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The appeal was consolidated with System Energy s prior appeal of the December 2022 order. 
 
 In September 2023 the LPSC filed with the FERC a request for rehearing and clarification of the rehearing order. The LPSC requests that the FERC reverse its determination in the rehearing order that System Energy may collect an implied return of and on the depreciated cost of the portion of the plant subject to the sale-leaseback, as of the expiration of the initial lease term, as well as its determination in the rehearing order that System Energy may offset the refunds for the depreciation rate input issue and collect interest on the rate base recalculations that were part of the overall depreciation rate recalculations. In addition, the LPSC requests that the FERC either confirm the LPSC s interpretation of the refund associated with the decommissioning uncertain tax positions or explain why it is not doing so. In October 2023 the FERC issued a notice that the rehearing request has been deemed denied by operation of law. In November 2023 the FERC issued a further notice stating that it would not issue any further order addressing the rehearing request. Also in November 2023 the LPSC filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit a petition for review of the FERC s August 2023 rehearing order and denials of the September 2023 rehearing request. 
 
 In December 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit lifted the abeyance on the consolidated System Energy appeals, and it also consolidated the LPSC s appeal with the System Energy appeals. In March 2024, separate petition briefs were filed by System Energy and by the LPSC. Also in March 2024, the City Council filed an intervenor brief supporting the LPSC. In June 2024 counsel for the FERC filed the respondent s brief, arguing that the FERC s August 2023 rehearing order concerning the sale-leaseback and depreciation rate remedy issues should be affirmed and arguing that the dispute over the uncertain tax position issue is not yet ripe. In July 2024, System Energy and the LPSC each filed separate reply briefs. In September 2024 the parties filed a joint motion to continue and stay oral argument, previously scheduled for October 2024, pending the FERC s decision whether to approve the settlement between System Energy and the LPSC, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the motion.

 LPSC Additional Complaints 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in May 2020 the LPSC authorized its staff to file additional complaints at the FERC related to the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf energy and capacity supplied to Entergy Louisiana under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Unit Power Sales Agreement Complaint 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, the first of the additional complaints was filed by the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council in September 2020. The first complaint raises two sets of rate allegations: violations of the filed rate and a corresponding request for refunds for prior periods; and elements of the Unit Power Sales Agreement are unjust and unreasonable and a corresponding request for refunds for the 15-month refund period and changes to the Unit Power Sales Agreement prospectively. In May 2021 the FERC issued an order addressing the complaint, establishing a refund effective date of September 21, 2020, establishing hearing procedures, and holding those procedures in abeyance pending the FERC s review of the initial decision in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback renewal complaint discussed above. 
 
 In November 2021 the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed direct testimony and requested the FERC to order refunds for prior periods and prospective amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. System Energy filed answering testimony in January 2022. In March 2022 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony recommending refunds and prospective modifications to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
 
 In April 2022, System Energy filed cross-answering testimony in response to the FERC trial staff s recommendations. In June 2022 the FERC trial staff submitted revised answering testimony, in which it recommended additional refunds associated with the accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190. Also in June 2022, System Energy filed revised and supplemental cross -answering testimony to respond to the FERC trial staff s testimony and oppose its revised recommendation. 
 
 In May 2022 the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed rebuttal testimony and asserted new claims. In June 2022 a new procedural schedule was adopted, providing for additional rounds of testimony and for the hearing to begin in September 2022. The hearing concluded in December 2022. Also in December 2022, a motion to extend the briefing schedule and the May 2023 deadline for the initial decision was granted. 
 
 In November 2022, System Energy filed a partial settlement agreement with the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC that resolved the following issues raised in the Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint: advance collection of lease payments, aircraft costs, executive incentive compensation, money pool borrowings, advertising expenses, deferred nuclear refueling outage costs, industry association dues, and termination of the capital funds agreement. The settlement provided that System Energy would provide a black box refund of 18 million (inclusive of interest), plus additional refund amounts with interest to be calculated for certain issues to be distributed to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans as the Utility operating companies other than Entergy Mississippi purchasing under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement further provided that if the APSC, the City Council, or the LPSC agrees to the global settlement System Energy entered into with the MPSC (see System Energy Settlement with the MPSC in the Form 10-K for discussion of the settlement), and such global settlement includes a black box refund amount, then the black box refund for this settlement agreement shall not be incremental or in addition to the global black box refund amount. The settlement agreement addressed other matters as well, including adjustments to rate base beginning in October 2022, exclusion of certain other costs, and inclusion of money pool borrowings, if any, in short-term debt within the cost of capital calculation used in the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In April 2023 the FERC approved the settlement agreement. The refund provided for in the settlement agreement was included in the May 2023 service month bills under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
 
 In May 2023 the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision finding that System Energy should have excluded multiple identified categories of accumulated deferred income taxes from rate base when calculating Unit Power

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Sales Agreement bills. Based on this finding, the initial decision recommended refunds; System Energy estimates that those refunds for Entergy Louisiana would total approximately 31.5 million plus 45.6 million of interest through September 30, 2024. The initial decision also finds that the Unit Power Sales Agreement should be modified such that a cash working capital allowance of negative 36.4 million is applied prospectively. If the FERC ultimately orders these modifications to cash working capital be implemented, the estimated annual revenue requirement impact is expected to be immaterial. On the other non-settled issues for which the complainants sought refunds or changes to the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the initial decision ruled against the complainants. 
 
 The initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process, and an ALJ s determination made in an initial decision is not controlling on the FERC. System Energy disagrees with the ALJ s findings concerning the accumulated deferred income taxes issues and cash working capital. In July 2023, System Energy filed a brief on exceptions to the initial decision s accumulated deferred income taxes findings. Also in July 2023, the APSC, the LPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff filed separate briefs on exceptions. The APSC s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the money pool interest and retained earnings issues. The LPSC s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations regarding the sale-leaseback transaction costs, legal fees, and retained earnings issues. The City Council s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the money pool and cash management issues. The FERC trial staff s brief on exceptions challenges the ALJ s determinations on the cash working capital issue as well as certain of the accumulated deferred income taxes issues. In August 2023 all parties filed separate briefs opposing exceptions. System Energy filed a brief opposing the exceptions of the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council. The APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council filed separate briefs opposing the exceptions raised by System Energy and the FERC trial staff. The FERC trial staff filed its own brief opposing certain exceptions raised by System Energy, the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council. The case is now pending a decision by the FERC. Refunds, if any, that might be required will become due only after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial decision. 
 
 LPSC Petition for a Writ of Mandamus 
 
 In March 2024 the LPSC filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit direct the FERC to take action on (1) System Energy s pending compliance filings (and the LPSC s protests) in response to the FERC s orders on the uncertain tax position rate base issue, as discussed above; and (2) the ALJ s pending initial decision in the return on equity and capital structure proceeding, also as discussed above. System Energy filed a notice of intervention in the proceeding. 
 
 In March 2024 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit directed the FERC to respond to the LPSC s petition. Also in March 2024, System Energy filed its response to the LPSC s petition, in which it opposed the LPSC s mandamus request on the compliance filing and took no position on the request for action on the return on equity and capital structure case. Later in March 2024, the FERC responded opposing both parts of the LPSC s petition, and the LPSC filed an opposed motion for leave to answer and its answer to the FERC s and System Energy s responses. In July 2024 the Fifth Circuit held oral argument on the petition. During oral argument, the FERC s counsel represented that the FERC intends to issue an order in the return on equity and capital structure proceeding by the end of the year. Later in July 2024 the Fifth Circuit issued an order denying the LPSC s petition. 
 
 System Energy Settlement with the APSC 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2023, System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, and additional named Entergy parties involved in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC reached a settlement in principle with the APSC to globally resolve all of their actual and potential claims in those dockets and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement also covers the amended and supplemental complaint, discussed in Grand Gulf Prudence Complaint in the Form 10-K, filed by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council at the FERC in October 2023. System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, additional Entergy parties, and the APSC filed the settlement agreement and supporting materials with the FERC in November 2023. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is a FERC-jurisdictional formula rate tariff for sales of energy and capacity from

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 System Energy s owned and leased share of Grand Gulf to Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy previously settled with the MPSC with respect to these complaints before the FERC. 
 
 The terms of the settlement with the APSC align with the 588 million global black box settlement reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022 and provide for Entergy Arkansas to receive a black box refund of 142 million from System Energy, inclusive of 49.5 million already received by Entergy Arkansas from System Energy. 
 
 In addition to the black box refund of 142 million described above, beginning with the November 2023 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy Arkansas s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of 9.65 and a capital structure not to exceed 52 equity. 
 
 In December 2023 the FERC trial staff and the LPSC filed comments. The FERC trial staff commented that it believes that the settlement is fair, and in the public interest, and neither it nor the LPSC oppose the settlement. In December 2023 the remaining black box refund to Entergy Arkansas was reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. In March 2024 the FERC approved the settlement because it appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. System Energy paid the remaining black box refund of 92 million to Entergy Arkansas in May 2024. 
 
 System Energy Settlement with the City Council 
 
 In April 2024, System Energy, Entergy New Orleans, and additional named Entergy parties involved in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC reached a settlement in principle with the City Council to globally resolve all of their actual and potential claims in those dockets and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement also covers the amended and supplemental complaint, discussed in Grand Gulf Prudence Complaint in the Form 10-K, filed by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council at the FERC in October 2023. In May 2024, System Energy, Entergy New Orleans, additional named Entergy parties, and the City Council filed the settlement agreement and supporting materials with the FERC. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is a FERC-jurisdictional formula rate tariff for sales of energy and capacity from System Energy s owned and leased share of Grand Gulf to Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. 
 
 The terms of the settlement with the City Council align with the 588 million global black box settlement amount reflected in the prior settlements reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022 and between System Energy and the APSC in November 2023. The settlement provides for Entergy New Orleans to receive a black box refund of 116 million from System Energy, inclusive of approximately 18 million already received by Entergy New Orleans from System Energy. In March 2024 the 98 million black box refund to Entergy New Orleans was reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. 
 
 In addition to the black box refund of 116 million described above, beginning with the June 2024 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy New Orleans s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of 9.65 and a capital structure not to exceed 52 equity. 
 
 In August 2024 the FERC approved the settlement because it appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. System Energy paid the remaining black box refund of 98 million to Entergy New Orleans in October 2024. As discussed above and in Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, System Energy previously settled with the MPSC and the APSC with respect to these complaints before the FERC. The settlements with the APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council represent almost 85 of System Energy s share of the output of Grand Gulf.

 In July 2024, System Energy and the LPSC staff reached a settlement in principle to globally resolve all of the LPSC s actual and potential claims in multiple docketed proceedings pending before the FERC (including all docketed proceedings resolved by the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council settlements) and with System Energy s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement also covers the amended and supplemental complaint, discussed in Grand Gulf Prudence Complaint in the Form 10-K, filed by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council at the FERC in October 2023. In August 2024 the LPSC approved the settlement. In September 2024 the settling parties filed the settlement for approval by the FERC. 
 
 The terms of the settlement with the LPSC align with the 588 million global black box settlement amount reflected in the prior settlements reached between System Energy and the MPSC in June 2022, between System Energy and the APSC in November 2023, and between System Energy and the City Council in April 2024. The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to receive a black box refund of 95 million from System Energy, inclusive of approximately 15 million already received by Entergy Louisiana from System Energy. In June 2024 the remaining 80 million black box refund to Entergy Louisiana was reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. 
 
 In addition to the black box refund of 95 million described above, beginning with the September 2024 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect an authorized rate of return on equity of 9.65 and a capital structure not to exceed 52 equity. 
 
 The settlement also includes an agreement that, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, Entergy Louisiana will divest to Entergy Mississippi all of its interest in Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its purchases from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff. Subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, divestiture will be effective on January 1, 2025. In October 2024 Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi filed with the FERC a power purchase agreement under which Entergy Mississippi would purchase Entergy Louisiana s purchases of Grand Gulf capacity and energy. The power purchase agreement is governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies. The parties requested that the FERC issue an order accepting the power purchase agreement no later than December 2024. 
 
 System Energy Regulatory Liability for Pending Complaints 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, System Energy had recorded a regulatory liability related to complaints against System Energy, which was consistent with the settlement agreements reached with the MPSC and the APSC, taking into account amounts already or expected to be refunded. System Energy s remaining regulatory liability related to complaints against System Energy as of December 31, 2023 was 178 million. As discussed above in System Energy Settlement with the City Council , in first quarter 2024 the 98 million black box refund to Entergy New Orleans was reclassified from the regulatory liability to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. As discussed above in System Energy Settlement with the LPSC , in second quarter 2024 the 80 million black box refund to Entergy Louisiana was reclassified from the regulatory liability to accounts payable - associated companies on System Energy s balance sheet. 
 
 Unit Power Sales Agreement 
 
 System Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2022 Calendar Year Bills 
 
 In February 2024, pursuant to the protocols procedures discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K, the LPSC and the City Council filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2022. The formal challenge alleges: (1) that the equity ratio charged in rates was excessive; and (2) that all issues in the pending Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint

 Management s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 proceeding should also be reflected in calendar year 2022 bills. These allegations are identical to issues that were raised in the formal challenge to the calendar year 2020 and 2021 bills. 
 
 In March 2024, System Energy filed an answer to the formal challenge in which it requested that the FERC deny the formal challenge as a matter of law, or else hold the proceeding in abeyance pending the resolution of related dockets. 
 
 Pension Costs Amendment Proceeding 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in October 2021, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to include in the rate base the prepaid and accrued pension costs associated with System Energy s qualified pension plans. Based on data ending in 2020, the increased annual revenue requirement associated with the filing is approximately 8.9 million. In March 2022 the FERC accepted System Energy s proposed amendments with an effective date of December 1, 2021, subject to refund pending the outcome of the settlement and/or hearing procedures. In August 2023 the FERC chief ALJ terminated settlement procedures and designated a presiding ALJ to oversee hearing procedures. In October 2023, System Energy filed direct testimony in support of its proposed amendments. Under the procedural schedule, testimony was filed through April 2024, and the hearing occurred in late May and early June 2024. 
 
 In September 2024 the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision recommending that t he FERC appro ve inclusion of a line item for prepaid and accrued pension costs; however, the presiding ALJ did not agree with System Energy s proposed methodology to calculate the value of the prepaid and accrued pension cost input. Instead, the presiding ALJ recommended limiting System Energy s recovery to the prepaid and accrued pension costs that were incurred beginning in 2015 and later. 
 
 System Energy disputes the presiding ALJ's determination concerning the methodology used to calculate the prepaid and accrued pension input, and System Energy filed exceptions to these rulings in October 2024. If the ALJ s determination is affirmed by the FERC, System Energy estimates refunds, including interest through September 30, 2024, of approximat ely 15 million to 19 million would be owed related to the ALJ s findings. The ALJ's initial decision is not binding on the FERC and is an interim step in the hearing process. No refunds will be owed in connection with this proc eeding and no changes to System Energy s pension cost recovery methodology will be implemented unless and until the FERC requires them in a final order. This proceeding is not covered by the global settlements described above.

 In accordance with Entergy s stock-based compensation plans, Entergy periodically grants stock options to key employees, which may be exercised to obtain shares of Entergy s common stock. According to the plans, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open market. Entergy s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the plans. In addition to this authority, the Board has authorized share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in response to market conditions. In October 2010 the Board granted authority for a 500 million share repurchase program. The amount of share repurchases under these programs may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities. In addition, in the first quarter 2024, Entergy withheld 101,960 shares of its common stock at 99.31 per share, 75,018 shares of its common stock at 98.86 per share, 1,731 shares of its common stock at 103.94 per share, 316 shares of its common stock at 102.64 per share, 232 shares of its common stock at 102.77 per share, 41 shares of its common stock at 100.15 per share, and 6 shares of its common stock at 104.68 per share to pay income taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock granted and payout of performance units as part of its long-term incentive program. 
 
 (1) See Note 12 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for additional discussion of the stock-based compensation plans. 
 (2) Maximum amount of shares that may yet be repurchased relates only to the 500 million share repurchase program plan and does not include an estimate of the amount of shares that may be purchased to fund the exercise of grants under the stock-based compensation plans.

 Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry 
 
 The following is an update to the Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry section of Part I, Item 1 of the Form 10-K. 
 
 NRC Reactor Oversight Process 
 
 The NRC s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: licensee response column, or Column 1, regulatory response column, or Column 2, degraded cornerstone column, or Column 3, multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column, or Column 4, and unacceptable performance, or Column 5. Plants in 
 
 206 

Table of Contents 

 Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5. All of the nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy s Utility business are currently in Column 1, except Waterford 3, which is in Column 2. 
 
 In August 2024 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2, effective second quarter 2024, based on exceeding the threshold for reactor scrams in June 2024. Waterford 3 will remain in Column 2 until a supplemental inspection is satisfactorily completed. 
 
 Environmental Regulation 
 
 The following are updates to the Environmental Regulation section of Part I, Item 1 of the Form 10-K. 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
 
 See the Form 10-K for discussion of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set by the EPA in accordance with the Clean Air Act. The following are updates to that discussion. 
 
 Revised Fine Particulate (PM 2.5 NAAQS 
 
 In March 2024 the EPA issued a final rule which revised the primary annual NAAQS for fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5 , from 12 ug/m 3 to 9 ug/m 3 . This new standard was effective May 2024 and initial attainment/nonattainment designations for areas with available information are due within two years, by May 2026. For any areas designated as nonattainment for this revised standard, State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to address nonattainment requirements will be due within 18 months of the effective date of any initial nonattainment designations. Within the areas in which the Utility operating companies operate, regulatory agency air monitor data from 2021-2023 for Pulaski County and Union County, Arkansas, West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, Harris County, Texas and Hinds County, Mississippi reflect annual average PM 2.5 concentrations in excess of this new standard and monitors for several other areas reflect concentrations between 8-9 ug/m 3 . Initial attainment and nonattainment designations will be based on data from 2022-2024. Entergy will continue to work with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing attainment and nonattainment with this revised fine particulate NAAQS. 
 
 Hazardous Air Pollutants 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, the EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011, which had a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year extension, of April 2016. The required controls have been installed and are operational at all affected Entergy units. In May 2024 the EPA issued a final rule revising portions of the MATS rule, including a reduction to the emission limit for filterable particulate matter. The revised standard will become effective July 2027 and could require additional capital investment and/or additional other operation and maintenance costs at Entergy s coal-fired generating units. An additional one-year extension is possible for the installation of controls, if necessary. Entergy is currently evaluating its coal units to determine whether additional controls are necessary to comply with this new lower standard. 
 
 Good Neighbor Plan/Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in June 2023 the EPA published its final Federal Implementation Plan (FIP), known as the Good Neighbor Plan, to address interstate transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS which would increase the stringency of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) program in all four of the states where the Utility operating companies operate. The FIP would significantly reduce ozone season NO x emission allowance budgets and allocations for electric generating units. Prior to issuance of the FIP, in February 2023 the EPA issued related SIP disapprovals for many states, including the four states in which the Utility operating companies operate, 
 
 207 

Table of Contents 

 and these SIP disapprovals are the subject of many legal challenges, including a petition for review filed by Entergy Louisiana challenging the disapproval of Louisiana s SIP. Stays of the SIP disapprovals have been granted in all four states in which the Utility operating companies operate, and the FIP will not go into effect while the stays are in place. Decisions on the merits regarding the respective SIP disapprovals are now expected in late 2024 or early 2025. The FIP is also subject to numerous legal challenges in various federal circuit courts of appeals, and in June 2024 the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order, in challenges filed in the D.C. Circuit, staying enforcement of the FIP pending the D.C. Circuit Court s review of the rule. Entergy is monitoring this litigation and assessing its compliance options in the event that the FIP becomes effective. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in April 2021, President Biden announced a target for the United States in connection with the United Nations Paris Agreement on climate change. The target consists of a 50-52 percent reduction in economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. President Biden has also stated that a goal of his administration is for the electric power industry to decarbonize fully by 2035. 
 
 Consistent with the Biden administration s stated climate goals, in May 2024 the EPA finalized rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from new combustion turbine electric generating units (EGUs) under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act and from certain existing coal- and gas-fired EGUs under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. 
 
 For new gas combustion turbine EGUs, the final rule includes three subcategories of emission standards based on the unit s annual capacity factor. Applicable emission standards for each subcategory are: a heat-input based CO 2 emission standard for low load 20 but 40 annual capacity factor) EGUs, a Phase 1 output-based CO 2 efficiency standard followed by a more stringent Phase 2 CO 2 standard which will apply beginning January 1, 2032. The Phase 2 standard was established based on an EPA determination that carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) represents the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for new base load combustion turbine EGUs. The final rule allows for a possible one-year extension to the compliance date for the Phase 2 standard in circumstances where a source faces a delay in installation of controls due to factors outside of the control of the EGU owner/operator. 
 
 For existing generating units, the final rule includes emission guidelines issued under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and allows states two years to develop a plan to implement the new emission guidelines with respect to subject emission units within their state. The final emission guidelines require reductions in CO 2 emissions from existing coal-fired generating units which plan to operate beyond January 1, 2032 and exempts coal-fired units which plan to permanently cease operations prior to this date. Due to Entergy s commitment to cease burning coal by the end of 2030, Entergy s coal-fired generating units are expected to be exempt from this aspect of the final rule. The emission guidelines also include CO 2 efficiency standards for existing gas-fired steam EGUs. These emission standards will apply beginning January 1, 2030. Entergy s existing gas-fired steam generating units are expected to meet these CO 2 emission standards. The EPA did not finalize emission guidelines for existing gas turbine EGUs and has announced plans to conduct a subsequent rulemaking for such units. 
 
 In September 2020, Entergy announced a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 inclusive of all businesses, all applicable gases, and all emission scopes. In 2022, Entergy enhanced its commitment to include an interim goal of 50 carbon-free energy generating capacity by 2030 and expanded its interim emission rate goal to include all purchased power. Due to stronger than initially expected sales growth, likely necessitating the development of new generation capacity that is not carbon-free, Entergy expects that achievement of the 50 carbon-free energy generating capacity goal will be delayed for a period beyond 2030 that has not been determined. In addition, while current planning assumptions indicate the 2030 emission rate goal remains achievable, its achievement could also be challenged as a result of the forecasted sales growth. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K for discussion of the risks associated with achieving these climate goals.

Coal Combustion Residuals 
 
 As discussed in the Form 10-K, in April 2015 the EPA published the final coal combustion residuals (CCR) rule regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes regulated under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle D. 
 
 Pursuant to the 2015 CCR rule, Entergy operates groundwater monitoring systems surrounding its CCR landfills located at White Bluff, Independence, and Nelson. In May 2024 the EPA finalized a rule establishing management standards for legacy CCR surface impoundments (i.e., inactive surface impoundments at inactive power plants) and establishing a new class of units referred to as CCR management units (CCRMUs) (i.e., non-containerized CCR located at a regulated CCR facility). CCR utilized in roadbeds and embankments is excluded from the CCRMU definition. Entergy does not have any legacy impoundments; however, the definition of CCR management units includes on-site areas where CCR was beneficially used. This is contrary to the 2015 CCR rule which exempted beneficial uses that met certain criteria. Under this expanded rule, all facilities must identify and delineate any CCRMU greater than one ton and submit a facility evaluation report by February 2026. Any potential requirements for corrective action or operational changes under the various CCR rules continue to be assessed. Notably, ongoing litigation has resulted in the EPA s continuing review of the rules. Consequently, the nature and cost of additional corrective action requirements may depend, in part, on the outcome of the litigation and further EPA review. Given the complexity and recency of the EPA guidance, Entergy is still evaluating the level of work that will ultimately be required to comply with the rule. Based on initial estimates of multiple possible remediation scenarios, Entergy recorded a 42 million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities for White Bluff and Independence, along with corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the unit. Entergy will continue to update the asset retirement obligation as the requirements of the 2024 CCR rule are clarified. As of September 30, 2024, Entergy has recorded asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of 72 million. Additionally, all three sites (White Bluff, Independence, and Nelson) are preparing to implement measures to meet the new and updated Effluent Limitation Guidelines discussed below. 
 
 Effluent Limitation Guidelines 
 
 The 2015 Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines required, among other things, that there be no discharge of bottom ash transport water. In 2020 the EPA finalized the Reconsideration Rule, allowing limited discharges of bottom ash transport water up to 10 of system volume, under certain defined circumstances including significant (10-year, 24-hour) rain events. The 2020 rule also created a subcategory for units that permanently cease coal combustion by December 31, 2028. Entergy s White Bluff facility filed a notice of planned participation for this subcategory in October 2021. In May 2024 the EPA finalized a supplemental rule that retains the retirement by 2028 subcategory, creates a new retirement by 2034 subcategory, otherwise reinstates the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water, and imposes new requirements for leachate after the facility ceases to burn coal. Thus, units which permanently cease combustion of coal by December 31, 2028 or December 31, 2034 are exempt from the zero-discharge requirement. However, for units in the 2034 subcategory, the 10 discharge allowance must be incorporated into the facility s discharge permit. To be covered by this exemption, both Independence and Nelson Unit 6 will need to file Notices of Planned Participation in the 2034 subcategory by December 31, 2025. To help ensure facilities cease combustion of coal by the required subcategory 2028 and 2034 dates, zero discharge of bottom ash transport water is required after April 30, 2029 and April 30, 2035, respectively. Entergy continues to evaluate the compliance pathways and obligations of this rule.
