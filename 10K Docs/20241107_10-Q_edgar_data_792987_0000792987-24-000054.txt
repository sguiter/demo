 Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1. 
 
 reportable segments (plus Corporate and Other) - Infrastructure Solutions and Materials Solutions. The Company's reportable business segments comprise sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations. 
 
 The Corporate and Other category consists primarily of the parent company and Astec Insurance Company ("Astec Insurance" or the "captive"), a captive insurance company, which do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as an operating segment or inclusion in one of the reporting segments. 
 
 interest in a consolidated subsidiary which is not owned by the Company. Since the Company controls this subsidiary, the subsidiary's financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company, and the noncontrolling owner's share of the subsidiary's net assets and results of operations is deducted and reported as "Noncontrolling interest" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as "Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company executed an agreement in February 2022 with the noncontrolling interest holder to acquire their outstanding interest in full for R M (approximately million, subject to the effect of exchange rates). Completion of the transaction is subject to resolution of certain disputes between the parties. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include inventory net realizable value, product warranty obligations, self-insurance loss reserves, capitalization of internal use software, goodwill and other intangible assets impairment and the measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and, except as otherwise discussed herein, such adjustments consist only of those of a normal recurring nature. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in a full reporting year. 
 
 All dollar amounts, except share and per share amounts, are in millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated.

million, reflecting a effective tax rate, compared to million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an effective tax rate. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher pretax book loss and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income and loss. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million, reflecting a effective tax rate, compared to a provision of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a effective tax rate. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an expense in the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower pretax book income and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income and loss, partially offset by a net nondeductible goodwill impairment. 

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase is the result of million of incremental reserves associated with a research and development credit generated during 2024. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations and federal, state, and foreign tax audit resolutions over the next twelve months. 
 
 The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the federal income tax return from the 2018 tax year as well as various other state income tax and jurisdictional audits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax positions it has taken will be sustained upon the resolution of its audits, resulting in no material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. However, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from the Company's estimates and/or from its historical income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and/or interest assessments.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These arrangements expire at various dates through September 2026. Additionally, the Company is also contingently liable for of the unpaid balance, determined as of December 31 of the prior year (or approximately million for 2024), on certain past customer equipment purchases that were financed by an outside finance company. The agreements provide that the Company will receive the lender's full security interest in the financed

 million and million related to these guarantees, which were included in "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company reviews off-balance sheet guarantees individually and at the loss pool level based on one agreement. Prior history is considered with respect to the Company having to perform on any off-balance sheet guarantees, as well as future projections of individual customer creditworthiness with respect to assessing credit losses related to off-balance sheet guarantees. 
 
 In addition, the Company is contingently liable under letters of credit issued under its million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), which outstanding letters of credit totaled million as of September 30, 2024. The outstanding letters of credit expire at various dates through September 2025. Unused letters of credit under the Credit Facility are million as of September 30, 2024. The Company is additionally contingently liable for a total of million in performance letters of credit and retention guarantees primarily held by its foreign subsidiaries, of which million are secured by separate credit facilities with various financial institutions as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were million of unused letters of credit under such separate credit facilities. 
 
 The Company and certain of its former executive officers were previously named as defendants in a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in 2019 alleging that the defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making allegedly false and misleading statements. On September 10, 2024, the court formally approved the parties' agreement to settle the action for million, which was funded entirely by the Company's insurance carriers into escrow , and the settlement agreement was entered into between the parties. The court dismissed the case with prejudice the same day. In connection with the settlement, management previously recorde d a liability of million in " Other current liabilities" and a corresponding million receivable from the Company's insurance carriers in "Trade receivables, contract assets and other receivables, net" during the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 The Company's GEFCO, Inc. ("GEFCO" or "Enid") subsidiary has been named a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed in 2018. The complaint alleged breaches of warranty and other similar claims regarding equipment sold by GEFCO in 2013 and also sought special and consequential damages. On October 8, 2024, the parties reached an agreement to resolve this action for million for which management recorded a loss in "Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 On October 5, 2023, a jury in the 355 th Judicial District Court, Hood County, State of Texas, rendered a verdict against the Company's Telsmith, Inc. subsidiary in the matter styled 37 Building Products, Ltd. ("37 BP") v. Telsmith, Inc. ("Telsmith"), et al. originally filed on January 28, 2019. 37 BP alleged breaches of warranty and negligent misrepresentation regarding equipment manufactured by Telsmith and purchased by 37 BP in 2017 through one of the Company's dealers. On December 19, 2023, a judgment was issued in the amount of million (the "Judgment") against Telsmith. Based on the jury verdict, management recorded a loss contingency of million in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2023 representing management's best estimate of the loss at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the loss contingency was increased million based on the Judgment to a total of million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Telsmith filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict that the court denied on December 19, 2023. Telsmith filed a Motion for New Trial and Motion for Remittitur in January 2024. The court denied Telsmith's motion for a new trial in February 2024. In March 2024, Telsmith filed a notice of appeal with the Texas Court of Appeals to appeal the Judgment by the district court. As of June 30, 2024, the total loss contingency recorded inclusive of post-judgment interest was million. In September 2024, the parties reached an agreement to resolve this action for million, which the Company paid in September 2024 whereby the full loss contingency was released. The million net impact of the loss contingency release and the final settlement amount was recorded in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In addition to the matters noted above, the Company is currently a party, and may become a party, to various other claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. If management believes that a loss arising from any claims and legal proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss (excluding estimated legal fees) or, when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, the minimum estimated liability. As management becomes aware of additional information concerning such contingencies, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. If management believes that a loss arising from such claims and legal proceedings is either (i) probable but cannot be reasonably estimated or (ii) reasonably estimable but not probable, the Company does not record the amount of the loss but does make specific disclosure of such matter. 
 
 Based upon currently available information and with the advice of counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome of its current claims and legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, claims and legal proceedings are subject to inherent

Executive Summary 
 
 Highlights of our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year include the following: 
 
 Net sales were 291.4 million, a decrease of 3.9 
 
 Gross profit was 66.8 million, a decrease of 4.0 
 
 Loss from operations was 7.2 million, an increase of 38.5 
 
 Net loss attributable to Astec was 6.2 million, a decrease of 6.1 
 
 Diluted loss per share was 0.27, a decrease of 6.9 
 
 Backlog was 475.9 million, a decrease of 22.6 
 
 Business Conditions and Trends 
 
 Strategic Transformation We are undergoing a multi-year phased implementation of a standardized ERP system, which is replacing much of our existing disparate core financial systems. During the second quarter of 2024, we modified the pace of deployment of future site conversions in order to improve efficiencies and reduce business disruptions at each manufacturing site, which will have the effect of reducing the scope to exclude sites outside North America. To date, we have launched the human capital resources module in our locations in the United States and converted the operations of three manufacturing sites along with Corporate, two of which occurred during the second quarter of 2024. We expect the project to conclude in 2027 with total approximate implementation costs anticipated to range from 180 to 200 million. Through the third quarter of 2024, we have incurred total implementation costs of approximately 127 million. Annual costs are expected to peak in 2024 to a range of 40 to 45 million and decrease annually each year through the final implementations in 2027. 
 
 In addition, a lean manufacturing initiative at one of our largest sites was largely completed during 2023 with certain capital investments finalized in early 2024. These investments, along with the other elements of the initiative, are expected to drive improvement in gross margin at that site in the second half of 2025.

 See Note 11, Strategic Transformation, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges, net of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of the costs related to these strategic initiatives. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment During the second quarter of 2024, we identified that indicators of goodwill impairment were present due to macroeconomic conditions, including declines in our publicly quoted share price and increased interest rates, as well as lower than expected operating results. These factors indicated that one or more of our reporting units may have fallen below their carrying amounts. We performed a qualitative assessment on all reporting units and concluded that a further quantitative analysis was required for the Materials Solutions reporting unit. Based on the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the carrying value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of June 30, 2024. As a result, we recognized a pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 20.2 million in "Goodwill impairment" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to fully impair the goodwill allocated to the Materials Solutions reporting unit. 
 
 VenVer Litigation On October 8, 2024, we reached an agreement to resolve the action styled VenVer S.A. and Americas Coil Tubing LLP v. GEFCO, Inc. for 8.4 million. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a loss of 8.4 million in "Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of this matter. 
 
 37 BP Litigation In September 2024, we reached an agreement for 6.3 million, which we paid in September 2024, to resolve the matter styled 37 Building Products, Ltd. v. Telsmith, Inc., et al. originally filed on January 28, 2019. Upon settlement, the full loss contingency of 8.2 million, inclusive of post-judgment interest, that was recorded as of June 30, 2024 was released. The 1.9 million net impact of the loss contingency release and the final settlement amount was recorded in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of this matter. 
 
 Segment Changes Our two reportable segments are comprised of sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations. Based on a review of these factors, our Australia and LatAm sites and Astec Digital have changed reportable segments beginning January 1, 2024. The Australia and LatAm sites were previously reported in the Infrastructure Solutions segment and have moved to the Materials Solutions segment. Astec Digital was previously included in the Corporate and Other category and has moved to the Infrastructure Solutions segment. Prior periods have been revised to reflect the changes to the segment composition for comparability. 
 
 Economic Conditions We monitor macroeconomic and other factors that may affect our business such as steel and oil prices, interest rates and geopolitical conflicts, among others. 
 
 Steel is a major component of our equipment. We anticipate that steel prices will remain consistent, and that steel demand will remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 
 
 Additionally, significant portions of our revenues from the Infrastructure Solutions segment relate to the sale of equipment involved in the production, handling, recycling or application of asphalt mix. Liquid asphalt is a by-product of oil refining, and changes in the price of oil impact the cost of asphalt, which is in turn likely to alter demand for asphalt and therefore affect demand for certain of our products. Based on the current macroeconomic environment, including ongoing international conflicts, we anticipate that oil prices will remain at relatively high levels throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 
 
 Elevated interest rates influence our customers' spending patterns, most notably impacting our dealer customers in the Materials Solutions segment. Interest rates have, in part, driven the decrease in our order backlog. While interest rates in the United States have fallen slightly in the third quarter of 2024, they remain at historically elevated levels. Additionally, our revolving credit loans bear interest on a variable basis and are subject to market volatility. We anticipate continuing to utilize the Credit Facilities with more frequency in the near term to support our working capital needs. Due to the increased borrowings under our Credit Facilities and higher interest rates, we expect our interest expense in the near term to remain at elevated levels. 
 
 New or ongoing geopolitical conflicts may cause a downturn in the commercial and residential construction industries in which we operate, cause an increase in oil prices, damage a significant portion of our inventory or materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We monitor, adjust and potentially cease our operations in affected jurisdictions to ensure compliance with any governmental actions made in response to such conflicts. 
 
 Whenever possible, we attempt to cover increased costs of production by adjusting the prices of our products. The markets we serve are competitive in nature, and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases.

 Results of Operations 

Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 291.4 million compared to 303.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 11.7 million, or 3.9 . The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by net unfavorable volume and mix partially offset by favorable pricing that generated decreases in equipment and parts and component sales of 7.8 million and 4.3 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in equipment installation revenue of 1.1 million. Sales reported by our foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars for the third quarter of 2024 would have been 0.3 million lower had third quarter 2024 foreign exchange rates been the same as third quarter 2023 rates. 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 were 946.1 million compared to 1,001.0 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 54.9 million, or 5.5 . The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by net unfavorable volume and mix partially offset by favorable pricing that generated decreases in (i) equipment sales of 34.6 million, (ii) service and equipment installation revenue of 19.2 million, (iii) used equipment of 4.3 million and (iv) freight revenue of 3.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other revenue and parts and component sales of 3.3 million and 3.0 million, respectively. Sales reported by our foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars for the first nine months of 2024 would have been 0.9 million higher had the first nine months of 2024 foreign exchange rates been the same as the first nine months of 2023 rates. 

Domestic sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 211.2 million, or 72.5 of consolidated net sales, compared to 229.6 million, or 75.8 of consolidated net sales, for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 18.4 million, or 8.0 . Domestic sales decreased primarily due to decreases in equipment and parts and components sales of 13.1 million and 6.8 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increased service and equipment installation revenue of 1.1 million. 
 
 Domestic sales for the first nine months of 2024 were 726.5 million, or 76.8 of consolidated net sales, compared to 797.3 million, or 79.7 of consolidated net sales, for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 70.8 million, or 8.9 . Domestic sales decreased primarily due to decreases in (i) equipment sales of 47.5 million, (ii) service and equipment installation revenue of 20.1 million, (iii) used equipment sales of 2.5 million, (iv) freight revenue of 2.4 million and (v) parts and component sales of 2.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased other revenue of 3.9 million. 

International sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 80.2 million, or 27.5 of consolidated net sales, compared to 73.5 million, or 24.2 of consolidated net sales, for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.7 million, or 9.1 . International sales increased primarily due to increases in equipment sales and parts and component sales of 5.3 million and 2.5 million, respectively. 
 
 International sales for the first nine months of 2024 were 219.6 million, or 23.2 of consolidated net sales, compared to 203.7 million, or 20.3 of consolidated net sales, for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 15.9 million, or 7.8 . International sales increased primarily due to increases in equipment sales and parts and component sales of 12.9 million and 5.2 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreased used equipment sales of 1.8 million. 

Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 66.8 million, or 22.9 of net sales, as compared to 69.6 million, or 23.0 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 4.0 . The decrease was primarily driven by manufacturing inefficiencies of 5.9 million and the impact of inflation on materials, labor and overhead of 3.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the sales impact of favorable pricing partially offset by net unfavorable volume and mix of 5.4 million and 1.0 million of favorable inventory period costs. 
 
 Gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 225.0 million, or 23.8 of net sales, as compared to 241.7 million, or 24.1 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 16.7 million, or 6.9 . The decrease was primarily driven by manufacturing inefficiencies of 24.2 million and the impact of inflation on materials, labor and overhead of 8.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by the sales impact of favorable pricing partially offset by net unfavorable volume and mix of 15.4 million. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8.7 million, or 11.7 , to 65.6 million, or 22.5 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 74.3 million, or 24.5 of net sales, for the third quarter of 2023. The decreases in selling general and administrative expenses are primarily due to (i) the loss contingency related to the 37 BP litigation, of which 6.4 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the 1.9 million benefit from the loss contingency release offset by the final settlement amount recorded during the third quarter of 2024, (ii) decreased employee incentive compensation costs of 1.5 million and (iii) lower bad debt expense of 1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher technology support costs and certain professional services of 1.4 million and higher costs related to our strategic transformation program of 0.9 million.

INDEX 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.4 million, or 0.7 , to 208.1 million, or 22.0 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 206.7 million, or 20.6 of net sales, for the first nine months of 2023. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily due to (i) increased personnel-related costs of 8.1 million, which includes the recovery of share-based compensation expense in the prior year that did not recur for awards that were forfeited or modified in conjunction with the termination of our previous CEO and the limited overhead restructuring action implemented in February 2023 of 2.6 million, (ii) higher technology support costs and certain professional services of 6.9 million and (iii) higher costs related to our strategic transformation program of 3.4 million. These increases were partially offset by (i) the loss contingency related to the 37 BP litigation, of which 6.4 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the 1.9 million benefit from the loss contingency release offset by the final settlement amount recorded during the third quarter of 2024, (ii) decreased employee incentive costs of 5.1 million and (iii) decreased exhibit and promotional costs of 1.3 million. 

Goodwill Impairment 
 
 We determined that the carrying value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of June 30, 2024. As a result, we recognized a pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 20.2 million in "Goodwill impairment" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to fully impair the goodwill allocated to the Materials Solutions reporting unit during the second quarter of 2024. After this impairment charge, no net goodwill related to Materials Solutions is reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024. See Note 4, Goodwill of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of the pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges and Gains, net 
 
 Restructuring, asset impairment charges and the loss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below:

INDEX 

 Income Tax 
 
 Our income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.3 million compared to 0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 27.1 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.5 for the third quarter of 2023. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher pretax book loss and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income and loss. 
 
 Our income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.6 million compared to a provision of 6.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. Our effective tax rate was 3.4 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.7 for the first nine months of 2023. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an expense in the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower pretax book income and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income and loss, partially offset by a net nondeductible goodwill impairment. 

Backlog 
 
 The backlog of orders as of September 30, 2024 was 475.8 million compared to 614.7 million as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of 138.9 million, or 22.6 . Domestic backlog decreased 133.0 million, or 26.0 , and international backlog decreased 5.9 million, or 5.7 . The backlog decreased 43.6 million to 351.1 million in the Infrastructure Solutions segment and decreased 95.3 million to 124.7 million in the Materials Solutions segment. 
 
 Strong customer demand and logistics and manufacturing throughput disruptions in 2021 and 2022 resulted in a build of backlog, which peaked in late 2022. The order backlog began to decrease throughout 2023 driven by sales delivery outpacing new orders and is approaching a historical range. Macroeconomic factors such as higher inflation and increased interest rates, among other factors, have influenced customer ordering patterns and are expected to continue. We have experienced variability in the ordering patterns from our dealer customers, most notably in the Materials Solutions segment, as a result of these factors. In addition, our shorter production lead times allow for customers to place orders closer to when the equipment delivery is desired. In order to support sales delivery and maintain optimal backlog levels, we have completed prudent expansions of our production capacity at certain manufacturing sites that we anticipate will allow us to more effectively convert backlog to sales in the future with greater efficiency and shorter lead times.

Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of segment profit or loss used by our CEO, who is considered to be the CODM, to evaluate performance and allocate resources to the operating segments. Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before the impact of interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments that are not considered by the CODM in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. Our presentation of Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each reportable segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. See Note 10, Segment Information, of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA to total consolidated net income attributable to controlling interest.

 Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA for the Infrastructure Solutions segment was 68.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 67.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.9 million, or 1.3 . The increase in Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA resulted primarily from (i) the sales impact of favorable pricing coupled with net favorable volume and mix that generated higher gross profit of 24.3 million (ii) decreases in annual incentive compensation costs of 1.5 million, (iii) decreases in new product development costs of 0.7 million and (iv) decreases in property maintenance costs of 0.6 million. The increase was partially offset by (i) manufacturing inefficiencies of 16.2 million, (ii) the impact of inflation on materials, labor and overhead of 6.1 million, (iii) higher IT support and professional services costs of 4.1 million and (iv) increased selling, general and administrative personnel-related costs of 3.1 million. 
 
 Materials Solutions 
 
 Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA for the Materials Solutions segment was 30.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 42.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 12.4 million, or 29.2 . The decrease in Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA resulted primarily from (i) manufacturing inefficiencies of 9.2 million, (ii) the sales impact of net unfavorable volume and mix partially offset by favorable pricing that decreased gross profit by 7.4 million and (iii) the impact of inflation on materials, labor and overhead of 2.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by the loss contingency related to the 37 BP litigation, of which 6.4 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the 1.9 million benefit from the loss contingency release offset by the final settlement amount recorded during the third quarter of 2024. 

Corporate and Other Operations 
 
 Corporate and Other operations had net expenses of 12.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 12.8 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 0.1 million, or 0.8 . Personnel related costs were materially consistent driven by 1.5 million general employee cost increases partially offset by decreases in annual incentive compensation costs of 1.0 million. 
 
 Corporate and Other operations had net expenses of 34.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 32.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 2.0 million, or 6.2 . The increase in expenses were primarily due to 2.5 million of higher technology support costs and certain professional services. Personnel related costs were materially consistent driven by 2.6 million in the prior year related to the recovery of share-based compensation expense for awards that were forfeited or modified in conjunction with the termination of our previous CEO and the limited overhead restructuring action implemented in February 2023 that did not recur which was partially offset by decreases in annual incentive compensation costs of 2.1 million and general employee cost decreases.

INDEX 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity was 195.1 million, consisting of 52.7 million of cash and cash equivalents available for operating purposes and 142.4 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, subject to our continued compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Our foreign subsidiaries held 34.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available for operating purposes, which is considered to be indefinitely invested in those jurisdictions. 
 
 Our future cash requirements primarily include working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, vendor-hosted software arrangements including the related implementation costs, unrecognized tax benefits and operating lease payments. In addition, our variable cash uses may include the payment of our quarterly cash dividend, financing other strategic initiatives of our business, including, but not limited to, transformation initiatives, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases under our share repurchase authorization. We believe that our current working capital, cash flows generated from future operations and available capacity under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for our existing business for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 On December 19, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility (consisting of revolving credit loans and swingline loans) and a letter of credit facility, in an aggregate amount of up to 250.0 million, (ii) an incremental credit facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed 125.0 million (the "Credit Facilities") and (iii) a maturity date of December 19, 2027. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including requirements related to our Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, each as defined in the agreement. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in the accelerated repayment of our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We had 99.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024. Our outstanding letters of credit totaling 8.6 million decreased borrowing availability to 142.4 million under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate continuing to utilize the Credit Facilities with more frequency in the near term to support our working capital needs. Due to the increased borrowings under our Credit Facilities and higher interest rates, we expect our interest expense in the near term to remain at elevated levels. 
 
 Certain of our international subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom each have separate credit facilities with local financial institutions primarily to finance short-term working capital needs and to cover foreign exchange contracts, performance letters of credit, advance payment and retention guarantees. In addition, the Brazilian subsidiary also enters into order anticipation agreements on a periodic basis. Both the outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities of the international subsidiaries and the order anticipation agreements are recorded in "Short-term debt" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each of the credit facilities are generally guaranteed by Astec Industries, Inc. and/or secured with certain assets of the local subsidiary. 
 
 We regularly enter into agreements, primarily to purchase inventory, in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, open purchase obligations totaled 121.9 million, of which 95.7 million are expected to be fulfilled within the remainder of 2024. 
 
 We estimate that our capital expenditures will be between 20.0 million and 25.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2024, which may be impacted by general economic, financial or operational changes and competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other considerations.

 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (13.6) (18.8) Net cash used in investing activities (14.0) (3.9) Net cash provided by financing activities 19.5 30.8 Effect of exchange rates on cash 0.2 (0.3) (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (7.9) 7.8 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 55.3 73.8 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 5.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower net cash usages for our operating assets and liabilities of 24.2 million partially offset by reduced cash inflows from net income reduced by non-cash charges of 19.7 million. The decreased net cash usage for our operating assets and liabilities were mainly driven by the timing of inventory purchases of 49.8 million and increases in customer deposits of 21.7 million. The decreased net cash usage was partially offset by the timing of payments on trade accounts payables of 35.6 million and higher employee-related payments of 14.0 million. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 14.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the cash inflows from the sale of the Tacoma facility's land, building and certain equipment assets for 19.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 that did not recur. This was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures of 9.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 
 Our financing activities provided net cash of 19.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to providing net cash of 30.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased borrowings, net of repayments, of 12.5 million. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We paid quarterly dividends of 0.13 per common share to shareholders in the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 As announced on July 30, 2018, we approved a share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to 150.0 million of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, 115.7 million remains available for repurchase under the approved share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased under the plan during the three months ended September 30, 2024; however, we may conduct opportunistic share repurchases under this authorization in future periods utilizing cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facilities. The timing, manner and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, financial performance, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our stock and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 
 Our total current assets increased to 740.1 million as of September 30, 2024 from 719.5 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 20.6 million, or 2.9 , due primarily to (i) increases of 22.5 million in trade and other receivables, which includes a 13.7 million receivable from our insurance carriers recorded in the first quarter of 2024 related to a pending litigation settlement and (ii) increased inventory of 10.8 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 7.9 million. 
 
 Our total current liabilities increased to 299.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 299.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Increases of 20.9 million and 13.8 million in other current liabilities and customer deposits, respectively, were partially offset by 
 29 

INDEX 

 decreases in accounts payables of 29.1 million. The increase in other current liabilities includes 13.7 million related to a pending litigation settlement corresponding to the related receivable from our insurance carriers. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described "Part II, Item 7. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. With the exception of the estimates utilized in the quantitative assessment for goodwill related to our Materials Solutions reporting unit, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 was filed. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from "Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our market risk exposures have not materially changed since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 was filed. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are currently undertaking a significant multi-year global ERP implementation to upgrade our information technology platforms and business processes. The implementation is occurring in phases over several years, which began in 2023. During 2023, we implemented the human capital resources management module, including the payroll application for all locations within the United States, the ERP at Corporate and one manufacturing site and the consolidations and reporting module. During the second quarter of 2024, we implemented the ERP at two additional manufacturing sites. 
 
 As a result of this multi-year implementation, we expect certain changes to our processes and procedures, which, in turn, will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While we expect this implementation to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, we will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal control over financial reporting as processes and procedures in the affected areas evolve. 
 
 With the exception of the implementations described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as noted elsewhere in this Report, there are no pending or threatened litigation proceedings that our management believes will result in an outcome that would materially affect our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that future litigation to which we become a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
