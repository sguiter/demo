 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 
 reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As described in "Note 3 Business Dispositions," during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of our former Consumer Solutions segment for periods prior to disposition. See "Note 15 Segment Information" for further information. Global Payments Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as "Global Payments," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us," unless the context requires otherwise. 
 
 These unaudited consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities that we do not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method, based on whether or not we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. 
 
 In the opinion of our management, all known adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring accruals and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

SEC Rule Changes - On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require disclosure of certain climate-related information, including disclosures relating to material climate-related risks, targets or goals, risk management and governance activities and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules require disclosure of certain climate-related financial metrics in the notes to the audited financial statements. The new disclosures are required on a prospective basis and provide for a phased-in compliance period. However, in April 2024, the SEC stayed the rules pending judicial review. Therefore, the timing of the effectiveness of these rules and their ultimate enforceability is uncertain.

 (1) Holders of EVO common stock, convertible preferred stock and common units received for each share of EVO common stock held at the effective time of the transaction. 
 
 (2) Pursuant to the merger agreement, we cash settled vested options and certain unvested equity awards of EVO equity award holders. 
 
 (3) Pursuant to the merger agreement, we granted equity awards for approximately million shares of Global Payments common stock to certain EVO equity award holders. Each such replacement award is subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability) that applied to the corresponding EVO equity award. We apportioned the fair value of the replacement awards between purchase consideration (the portion attributable to pre-acquisition services in relation to the total vesting term of the award) and amounts to be recognized in periods following the acquisition as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the replacement awards. 

The cash portion of the purchase consideration was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made measurement-period adjustments that increased the amount of goodwill by million, primarily related to deferred income taxes as a result of finalizing the evaluation of the differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.

 convertible notes due March 1, 2031 
 
 On February 23, 2024, we issued billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible unsecured senior notes due March 2031 through a private placement. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately billion reflecting debt issuance costs of million, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the convertible notes in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024, to the holders of record on the preceding February 15 and August 15, respectively. 
 
 Prior to December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions, including: (i) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price for at least trading days within the last consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) for a business day period following a -day consecutive trading period where the trading price of the notes is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate; (iii) if we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or (iv) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. On or after December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date. The conversion rate for the notes is initially 6.371 shares of common stock per 1,000 in principal amount of the notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share), subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, the principal amount of, and interest due on, the convertible notes are required to be settled in cash and any other amounts may be settled in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at our election. 
 
 We may not redeem the notes prior to March 6, 2028. On or after March 6, 2028, we have the option to redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price for at least trading days within the last consecutive trading day period at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, any holder of the notes may require that we repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, then the conversion rate will in certain circumstances be increased. The notes include customary covenants for notes of this type, as well as customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the convertible notes. 
 
 In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes and other financial institutions to cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the notes. The economic effect of the capped call transactions is to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon the conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option is elected, for amounts in excess of the principal amount of converted notes subject to a cap. The initial cap price of the capped call

 per share. The capped call transactions meet the accounting criteria to be reflected in stockholders equity and not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of million incurred in connection with the capped call transactions was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, net of applicable income taxes. 
 
 convertible notes due August 15, 2029 
 
 We have billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due August 2029, which were issued during 2022 in a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2023, to the holders of record on the preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively. The convertible notes mature on August 15, 2029, subject to earlier conversion or repurchase. The notes, which are currently convertible, are presented within long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet based on our intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis should a conversion event occur. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 Our revolving credit agreement provides for an unsubordinated unsecured billion revolving credit facility that matures in August 2027. As of September 30, 2024, there were borrowings of billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an interest rate of , and the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were billion. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 
 We have a billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to days from the date of issue. Commercial paper notes are expected to be issued at a discount from par, or they may bear interest, each at commercial paper market rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used primarily for general corporate purposes but may also be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other purposes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our comm ercial paper program. The commercial program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. As suc h, we could draw on the revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper notes that cannot be rolled over or refinanced with similar debt . 
 
 Fair Value of Long-Term Debt 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our senior notes had a total carrying amount of billion and an estimated fair value of billion. As of September 30, 2024, our convertible notes due March 1, 2031 had a total carrying amount of billion and an estimated fair value of billion. The estimated fair values were based on quoted market prices in active markets and are considered to be Level 1 measurements of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our convertible notes due August 15, 2029 had a total carrying amount of billion and an estimated fair value of billion. The estimated fair value of our convertible notes was based on a lattice pricing model and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 The fair value of other long-term debt approximated its carrying amount at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Compliance with Covenants 
 
 The convertible notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. The required leverage ratio was increased as a result of the acquisition of EVO and will gradually step-down over quarters to the original required ratio of to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, the required leverage ratio was to 1.00, and the required interest coverage ratio was to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 million Euro-denominated senior notes due March 2031 as a hedge of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations. The purpose of the net investment hedge is to reduce the volatility of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the reporting currency are subject to foreign currency risk as the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the reporting currency at the period-end rate of exchange with the resulting foreign currency translation adjustment presented as a component of other comprehensive income and included in accumulated comprehensive income within equity in our consolidated balance sheets. Under net investment hedge accounting, the foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with our Euro-denominated senior notes are presented within the same components of other comprehensive income and accumulated comprehensive income, partially offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment for our foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 We recognized a (loss) gain of ) million and million within foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and ) million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 We have interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to hedge changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments. In the first quarter of 2023, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion to convert eligible borrowings under our revolving credit facility from a floating term Secured Overnight Financing Rate to a fixed rate. Net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. Since we have designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses resulting from adjusting the swaps to fair value are recognized as components of other comprehensive income. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date. These derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Our effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed favorably from the U.S. statutory rate primarily as a result of foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included the favorable effect of a change in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate of was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the favorable effects of foreign-derived intangible income deductions, tax credits and foreign interest income not subject to tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate of was higher than the U.S. statutory rate as a result of a gain on the dispositions of our consumer and gaming businesses for income tax reporting purposes, while a net loss on the dispositions was recognized for financial reporting purposes, which was partially offset by the favorable effect on the rate of foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction.

Under the shareholder agreement, the minority shareholder has the option to compel us to purchase their shares at fair market value upon the occurrence of a specific change in control event. As of September 30, 2024, the option is not considered probable of becoming redeemable. We also own of our subsidiary in Greece and of our subsidiary in Chile. Under the respective shareholder agreements, the minority shareholders have the option to compel us to purchase their shares at a price per share based on the fair value of the shares, or under certain circumstances for our subsidiary in Greece, at a price determined by calculations stipulated in the shareholder agreement. The options have no expiration date. 
 
 Because the exercise of each of these redemption options is not solely within our control, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented in the mezzanine section between total liabilities and shareholders equity, as temporary equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable noncontrolling interest for each subsidiary is reflected at the higher of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of comprehensive income (loss), capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption price. 
 
 The option held by the minority shareholder in Greece, which is redeemable at a price other than fair value, is considered probable of becoming redeemable on December 8, 2025. In determining the measurement method of redemption price, we have elected to accrete changes in the redemption price over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument using the effective interest method, applied prospectively. We have also elected to recognize the entire amount

 The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. Our assumption on expected volatility was based on our historical volatility. The dividend yield assumption was determined using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our most current quarterly dividend per share.

 The effect of the potential shares needed to settle the conversion spread on our convertible notes is included in diluted EPS if the effect is dilutive. The effect depends on the market share price of our common stock at the time of conversion and would be dilutive if the average market share price of our common stock for the period exceeds the conversion price. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the convertible notes were not included in the computation of diluted EPS as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Further, the effect of the related capped call transactions is not included in the computation of diluted EPS as it is always anti-dilutive.

 Visa preferred shares 
 
 Through certain of our subsidiaries in Europe, we were a member and shareholder of Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe"). In June 2016, Visa Inc. ("Visa") acquired all of the membership interests in Visa Europe, and we received consideration in the form of cash and Series B and C convertible preferred shares of Visa. We assigned the preferred shares received a value of based on transfer restrictions, Visa's ability to adjust the conversion rate and the estimation uncertainty associated with those factors. Based on the outcome of any current or potential litigation involving Visa Europe in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, the conversion rate of the preferred shares could be adjusted down such that the number of Visa common shares we receive could be as low as . 
 
 The Series B and C convertible preferred shares become convertible in stages based on developments in the litigation and become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any then pending claims). In July 2024, in connection with the third mandatory release assessment, a portion of the Series B and C convertible preferred shares was converted by Visa. We recognized a gain of million reported in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on the fair value of the shares received. The converted shares were subsequently sold in September and October 2024.

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report and the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 We are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. Our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world. 
 
 We have grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, and continue to invest in new technology solutions, infrastructure to support our growing business and the ongoing consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. These investments include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and solutions available to customers, along with migration of certain underlying technology platforms to cloud environments to enhance performance, improve speed to market and drive cost efficiencies. We also continue to execute on integration and other business transformation activities, such as combining business operations, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. 
 
 Highlights related to our financial condition at September 30, 2024, and results of operations for the three and nine months then ended, include the following: 
 
 Consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 2,601.6 million and 7,590.5 million, respectively, compared to 2,475.7 million and 7,220.6 million, respectively, for the prior year. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to growth in transaction volumes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect on revenues from the EVO business acquired in March 2023 was offset by the effect on revenues from the divestitures of our gaming and consumer businesses in April 2023. 
 
 Merchant Solutions segment operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and Issuer Solutions segment operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of increases in revenues, as certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues. Merchant Solutions operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflected an increase related to the acquired EVO business, as the same period in 2023 only reflected the acquisition for a portion of the period. Issuer Solutions segment operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the prior year due to slightly higher costs. 
 
 Consolidated operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues as compared to the prior year and lower acquisition and integration expenses. These favorable effects were offset by expenses related to business transformation activities, a technology asset charge and an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles, primarily related to the acquisition of EVO. Consolidated operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included the effects of the gain on the sale of our gaming business and the loss on the sale of our consumer business. 
 
 On February 23, 2024, we issued 2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.500 convertible unsecured senior notes due March 2031 through a private placement. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option were to be elected, for amounts in excess of the principal amount of converted notes up to a cap price.

Strategy and Business Transformation 
 
 Early this year, we launched a holistic review of our business to examine our strategy, operational fitness and ability to deliver sustainable performance. We refreshed our strategy to ensure we are focusing our resources, efforts and investments on the areas of the business that will drive the best opportunities for growth. We then evaluated our organizational structure and operating model and capacity to execute against this strategy. This gave rise to a broad operational transformation agenda to ensure we are poised for success. 
 
 We are streamlining and simplifying our strategy, organization and operating environment through our transformation program to deliver a global, unified operating company. We are aligning the Global Payments brand identity across our assets and solidifying go-to-market activities under a common umbrella. In our Merchant Solutions segment, we are harmonizing products and capabilities and prioritizing small and medium-sized businesses to deliver our full suite of differentiated software and commerce enablement solutions. In our Issuer Solutions segment, we are capitalizing on growth opportunities through our cloud modernization and cross-selling initiatives, while also leveraging the strategic value of this business to extend our capabilities across the payments value chain. 
 
 We have consolidated our technology organizations and teams under common leadership to enhance speed and quality of product development with a customer-centric, product-led mindset. We have also centralized our operations functions to enhance our servicing model and focus on improving the customer journey, leveraging best-in-class technology and providing differentiated service experiences for our clients. 
 
 These strategic, organizational and operational transformation activities have just begun and are expected to continue over the next few years. As we focus on executing and delivering transformation initiatives, we anticipate incremental expenses related to the transformation and potential asset impairment charges through early 2027. We are also undertaking a strategic review of our business portfolio to evaluate potential assets for divestiture to further streamline our business and create value for shareholders. 
 
 We expect our transformation initiatives to generate more than 500 million of annual run-rate operating income benefit by the first half of 2027. 
 
 Risks Related to Macroeconomic Effects and Other Global Conditions 
 
 We are exposed to general economic conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation, rising interest rates and other conditions that affect the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
 
 Certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. Consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses has been and may continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar or other significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in an adverse effect on our future financial results; however, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results. 
 
 We have sought to reduce our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt in place of variable rate debt and through interest rate swap hedging arrangements that convert a significant portion of the eligible variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility to a fixed rate. However, inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and financial performance as a result of higher costs and/or lower consumer spending. In addition, continued inflation or a rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our future financial results and the recoverability of assets. However, as the future magnitude, duration and effects of these conditions are difficult to predict at this time, we are unable to predict the extent of the potential effect on our financial results.

Table of Contents 

 We regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, which could affect our ability to access our cash or cash equivalents, our ability to provide settlement services or our customers' ability to access their existing cash to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The occurrence of these events could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We also continue to evaluate the potential effects on our business from heightened geopolitical and economic instability or increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action, such as those arising from recent global events, which have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty in various regions of the world. Although we have not experienced significant exposure or adverse effects on our business and financial results to date, the extent to which these events could affect the global economy and our operations is difficult to predict at this time. However, a significant escalation, expansion of the scope or continuation of the related economic disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by a downturn in macroeconomic conditions. When adverse macroeconomic conditions arise, we evaluate where we may be able to implement cost-saving measures, including those related to headcount and discretionary expenses. 
 
 For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our future operating results, see the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings we make with the SEC, including this Form 10-Q.

 Results of Operations 
 
 We operate in two reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As described in Note 3 Business Dispositions in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. Our former Consumer Solutions segment is presented below for periods prior to disposition. For further information about our reportable segments, see Item 1. Business Business Segments within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, incorporated herein by reference, and Note 15 Segment Information in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements. 
 
 Key Drivers of our Results of Operations 
 
 Our revenues for both of our segments are dependent upon the volume of payment transactions we process, cardholder accounts on file and other factors (transaction volume). As the majority of our services are priced as a percentage of transaction value or specified fee per unit or transaction, many under multi-year customer arrangements, our revenues generally grow period-over-period in line with the rate of increase in transaction volume. 
 
 Our operating expenses consist primarily of the cost of the technology to provide services to our customers and our people costs to support the operations. Many of those costs do not vary directly with the level of payment transactions we process for our customers, generating operating leverage. As revenues increase, operating income and operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) generally increase. 
 
 We also grow our business through strategic acquisitions of similar businesses. Our revenues increase from the transaction volume from the customers of the acquired businesses. As we integrate the businesses, we also are able to improve operating income and operating margin by generating synergies to lower the cost base of those businesses.

 Merchant Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Merchant Solutions segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 113.7 million, or 6.0 , to 1,997.7 million, compared to 1,884.0 million for the prior year. Revenues from our Merchant Solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 470.9 million, or 8.8 , to 5,802.8 million, compared to 5,331.9 million for the prior year. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our technology-enabled distribution channel contributed 86.5 million to segment revenue growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our technology-enabled distribution channel contributed 295.5 million to segment revenue growth. The increase in revenues in our technology-enabled distribution channel was primarily driven by growth in transaction volume within integrated and embedded payments from new customers and incremental cross-selling of services. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our relationship-led distribution channel contributed 27.2 million to segment revenue growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our relationship-led channel contributed 175.4 million to segment revenue growth. The increase in revenues in our relationship-led distribution channel was primarily driven by an increase in transaction volume, including from recently acquired businesses. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net impact of our acquisition and divestiture activities contributed approximately 3.1 growth to Merchant Solutions, with the EVO business acquired in March 2023 contributing approximately 3.6 growth. 
 
 Issuer Solutions Segment. Revenues from our Issuer Solutions segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.2 and 3.9 , respectively, to 621.1 million and 1,837.4 million, respectively, compared to 607.8 million and 1,769.2 million, respectively, for the prior year. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transaction volume. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Cost of Service. Cost of service for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 946.9 million and 2,807.8 million, respectively, compared to 915.5 million and 2,805.2 million, respectively, for the prior year. Cost of service as a percentage of revenues decreased to 36.4 and 37.0 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.0 and 38.9 , respectively, for the prior year. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of service as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved operating leverage in the business, partially offset by increases of 10.0 million and 43.7 million, respectively, in amortization and depreciation expenses, primarily related to amortization of acquired intangibles for recent acquisitions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of service as a percentage of revenues also decreased as a result of the divestiture of our consumer business, which had a higher cost of service as a percentage of revenues relative to our Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions segments. The effect on cost of service as a percentage of revenues of the acquired EVO business was insignificant.

 portion of our Visa convertible preferred shares. See "Note 13 Supplemental Balance Sheet Information" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included an increase of 29.3 million in interest income on the seller financing notes that were issued in connection with the sale of our consumer and gaming businesses in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest and other expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 155.9 million and 477.2 million, respectively, compared to 176.1 million and 490.5 million, respectively, for the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in interest and other expense was primarily due to lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings. Interest and other expense decreased for the nine month period, as the prior year period ended September 30, 2023 included a noncash charge of 18.2 million for the estimated future credit losses on the seller financing notes receivable. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective income tax rates of 15.3 and 13.4 , respectively, included the favorable effects of foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective income tax rate included the favorable effect of a change in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was 14.1 . The effective rate included the favorable effects from foreign-derived intangible income deductions, tax credits and foreign interest income not subject to tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was 24.9 . The effective tax rate reflects recognition of a gain on the dispositions of our consumer and gaming businesses for income tax reporting purposes, while a net loss on the dispositions was recognized for financial reporting purposes. This was partially offset by the favorable effect on the rate of foreign interest income not subject to tax, tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. 
 
 In December 2022, the EU Member States formally adopted the Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Framework. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. We do not expect the Pillar Two Directive to have any significant effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to Global Payments 
 
 Net income attributable to Global Payments was 315.1 million and 1,003.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 361.8 million and 624.9 million, respectively, for the prior year, reflecting the changes noted above. 
 
 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 
 Diluted earnings per share was 1.24 and 3.92, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.39 and 2.39, respectively, for the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the changes in net income.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have numerous sources of capital, including cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations as well as various sources of financing. In the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows and borrowings, including the capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Our capital allocation priorities are to pay dividends, to repurchase shares of our common stock, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to make planned capital investments in our business and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Our significant contractual cash requirements also include ongoing payments for lease liabilities and contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts, which primarily relate to software, technology infrastructure and related services. Commitments under our borrowing arrangements are further described in "Note 6 Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and below under "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit." For additional information regarding our other cash commitments and contractual obligations, see "Note 7 Leases" and Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while optimizing our cost of capital and financial position. To supplement cash from operating activities, we use a combination of bank financing, such as borrowings under our credit facilities, commercial paper program and senior note issuances, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. Our commercial paper program provides a cost effective means of addressing our short-term liquidity needs and is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. Finally, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card networks. 
 
 We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of debt or equity or by other means. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments. We believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the near and long term. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 2,941.9 million. Of this amount, we considered 888.4 million to be available for general purposes, of which 64.7 million is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The available cash of 888.4 million does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("Merchant Reserves") and (iii) certain funds held for customers. Settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement-related cash balances are not restricted in their use; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. Merchant Reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant's agreement. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash as a Merchant Reserve strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors. Funds held for customers, which are not restricted in their use, include amounts collected before the corresponding obligation is due to be settled to or at the direction of our customers. 
 
 We also had restricted cash of 197.6 million as of September 30, 2024, representing amounts under legal restriction, amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve. These balances are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use.

 Operating activities provided net cash of 2,879.3 million and 1,591.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which reflect net income adjusted for noncash items, including depreciation, amortization, the provision for credit losses and charges associated with the net loss on business dispositions, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash flows from operating activities from the prior year was due to assets and liabilities that are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, including changes in settlement processing assets and obligations and accounts payable and other liability balances. 
 
 We used net cash in investing activities of 846.6 million and 4,119.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used for investing activities primarily represents cash used to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used cash of 373.8 million and 4,099.8 million, respectively, for acquisitions. We made capital expenditures of 490.9 million and 500.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, infrastructure to support our growing business and the consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. These investments also include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloud-based solutions available to customers. We expect to continue to make significant capital investments in the business, and we anticipate capital expenditures to approximate 670.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2024. Investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes cash received from the sale of our investments in Visa common shares of 18.1 million. Additionally, investing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the net effect on cash from the sale of our consumer and gaming businesses and the initial issuance and subsequent repayment of a 50 million secured revolving credit facility available from the date of the sale to the purchasers of the consumer business. 
 
 Financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our various debt arrangements, as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. Our borrowing arrangements are further described in "Note 6 Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and below under "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit." Financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs, cash distributions made to our shareholders and cash contributions from and distributions to noncontrolling interests. We used net cash in financing activities of 1,151.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and financing activities provided net cash of 2,458.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Proceeds from long-term debt were 7,637.9 million and 8,861.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Repayments of long-term debt were 5,803.0 million and 7,628.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from and repayments of long-term debt consist of borrowings and repayments that we make with available cash, from time-to-time, under our revolving credit facility, as well as scheduled principal repayments we make on our senior notes, finance leases and other vendor financing arrangements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net repayments of 1,367.9 million and net borrowings of 1,900.0 million, respectively, under our commercial paper program. Furthermore, in connection with the issuance of convertible notes in February 2024, we paid 256.3 million to purchase privately negotiated capped call transactions to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option were to be elected. See section "Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" below for further discussion of our recent debt transactions. 
 
 Activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net repayments of 184.5 million and 33.3 million, respectively, under our settlement lines of credit. 
 
 We repurchase our common stock mainly through open market repurchase plans and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used 900.0 million and 418.3 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The share repurchase activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the repurchase of 1,414,759 shares using a portion of the net proceeds from our offering of 1.500 convertible unsecured senior notes due March 2031 through privately negotiated transactions with purchasers of notes in the offering, or one of their respective affiliates. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased in such transactions equaled the closing price of the common stock on February 20, 2024, which was 130.80 per share.

 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount available under our share repurchase program was 1,371.9 million. On October 24, 2024, our board of directors approved an increase to our existing share repurchase program authorization, which raised the total available authorization to 2.5 billion. 
 
 We paid dividends to our common shareholders in the amounts of 190.5 million and 195.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We made distributions to noncontrolling interests in the amount of 29.4 million and 24.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 We have 11.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which mature at various dates ranging from November 2024 to August 2052. Interest on the senior notes is payable annually or semi-annually at various dates. Each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time-to-time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 On February 23, 2024, we issued 2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.500 convertible unsecured senior notes due March 2031 through a private placement. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 1.97 billion reflecting debt issuance costs of 33.5 million, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the convertible notes in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024, to the holders of record on the preceding February 15 and August 15, respectively. 
 
 Prior to December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions, including: (i) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) for a five business day period following a ten-day consecutive trading period where the trading price of the notes is less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate; (iii) if we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or (iv) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. On or after December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date. The conversion rate for the notes is initially 6.371 shares of common stock per 1,000 in principal amount of the notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately 156.96 per share), subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, the principal amount of, and interest due on, the convertible notes are required to be settled in cash and any other amounts may be settled in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at our election. 
 
 We may not redeem the notes prior to March 6, 2028. On or after March 6, 2028, we have the option to redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within the last 30 consecutive trading day period at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, any holder of the notes may require that we repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, then the conversion rate will in certain circumstances be increased. The notes include customary covenants for notes of this type, as well as customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the convertible notes. 
 
 In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes and other financial institutions to cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the notes. The economic effect of the capped call transactions is to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon the conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option is elected, for amounts in excess of the principal amount of converted notes subject to a cap. The initial cap price of the capped call transactions is 228.90 per share. The capped call transactions meet the accounting criteria to be reflected in stockholders

 equity and not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of 256.3 million incurred in connection with the capped call transactions was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, net of applicable income taxes. 
 
 We also have 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.000 convertible notes due August 2029, which were issued during 2022 in a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2023, to the holders of record on the preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively. The convertible notes mature on August 15, 2029, subject to earlier conversion or repurchase. The notes, which are currently convertible, are presented within long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet based on our intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis should a conversion event occur. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 Our revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents, provides for an unsubordinated unsecured 5.75 billion revolving credit facility that matures in August 2027. 
 
 We may issue standby letters of credit of up to 250.0 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. The amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant. As of September 30, 2024, there were borrowings of 1.5 billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an interest rate of 6.56 , and the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were 4.2 billion. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 
 We have a 2.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. As such, we could draw on the revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper notes that cannot be rolled over or refinanced with similar debt. 
 
 Commercial paper notes are expected to be issued at a discount from par, or they may bear interest, each at commercial paper market rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used primarily for general corporate purposes but may also be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other purposes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we ha d no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. 
 
 Compliance with Covenants 
 
 The convertible notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. The required leverage ratio was increased as a result of the acquisition of EVO, and will gradually step-down over eight quarters to the original required ratio of 3.75 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, the required leverage ratio was 4.25 to 1.00, and the required interest coverage ratio was 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 Settlement Lines of Credit 
 
 In various markets where we do business, we have specialized lines of credit that are restricted for use in funding settlement. The settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding lines of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 75.9 million of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 788.1 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of 2,203.7 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were 996.4 million and 534.8 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 5.63 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 See "Note 6 Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further information about our borrowing agreements. 
 
 Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 
 From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. See "Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Some of the statements we use in this report, and in some of the documents we incorporate by reference in this report, contain forward-looking statements concerning our business operations, economic performance and financial condition, including, but not limited to, statements we make regarding our business strategy and means to implement the strategy; measures of future results of operations, such as revenues, expenses, operating margins, income tax rates, and earnings per share; other operating metrics such as shares outstanding and capital expenditures, liquidity, deleveraging plans and capital available for allocation; statements we make regarding guidance and projected financial results for the year 2024; the effects of general economic conditions on our business; statements about the benefits of our acquisitions or divestitures, such as the proposed sale of AdvancedMD, Inc., including future financial and operating results and the successful integration of acquisitions, statements about the completion of anticipated benefits or strategic or operational initiatives; statements regarding our success and timing in developing and introducing new services and expanding our business; and other statements regarding our future financial performance and the company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. You can sometimes identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plan," "forecast," "guidance" and similar expressions. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 
 Although we believe that the plans and expectations reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements are based on a number of assumptions, estimates, projections or plans that are inherently subject to significant risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our plans and expectations will be achieved. Our actual revenues, revenue growth rates and margins, and other results of operations could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, many of which are beyond our ability to predict or control. Important factors that may otherwise cause actual events or results to differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements or historical performance include, among others, the effects of global economic, political, market, health and social events or other conditions; foreign currency exchange, inflation and rising interest rate risks; difficulties, delays and higher than anticipated costs related to integrating the businesses of acquired companies, including with respect to implementing controls to prevent a material security breach of any internal systems or to successfully manage credit and fraud risks in business units; our ability to complete the proposed sale of AdvancedMD, Inc. on the proposed terms or on the anticipated timeline, or at all; the effect of a security breach or operational failure on our business; failing to comply with the 
 44

 applicable requirements of Visa, Mastercard or other payment networks or card schemes or changes in those requirements; the ability to maintain Visa and Mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship; the ability to retain, develop and hire key personnel; the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations; the continued availability of capital and financing; increased competition in the markets in which we operate and our ability to increase our market share in existing markets and expand into new markets; our ability to safeguard our data; risks associated with our indebtedness; our ability to meet environmental, social and governance targets, goals and commitments; the potential effects of climate change, including natural disasters; the effects of new or changes in current laws, regulations, credit card association rules or other industry standards on us or our partners and customers, including privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations; and other events beyond our control, and other factors presented in "Item 1A - Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings we make with the SEC, including this Form 10-Q, which we advise you to review. 
 
 These cautionary statements qualify all of our forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our plans and expectations as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update or revise forward-looking statements at some time in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to our forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, management carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In our opinion, the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from the outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. See "Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for information about certain legal matters. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 The following risk factors are an update to our previously disclosed risk factors and should be considered in conjunction with the "Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any subsequent filings we make with the SEC. 
 
 We may not realize the anticipated growth benefits and cost savings from, or our business may be disrupted by, our business transformation and reorganization activities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 We are streamlining and simplifying our strategy, organization and operating environment through a transformation program that will deliver a global unified operating company. These transformation activities began in the third quarter of 2024, and are expected to continue over the next few years. Our strategic initiatives may not deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated timeframes. In addition, these efforts may disrupt our business activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.

 (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 cannot be satisfied, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L C Issuer an L C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 
 
 (iv) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the applicable L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such L C Issuer.

 (b) 
 
 (i) Funding by Lenders Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loan or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans, prior to 12 00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars or, in the case of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by such Borrower shall be 
 4857-0343-4029 4880-4767-9669 v. 9 3 
 63 

without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 
 (ii) Payments by Borrowers Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the applicable L C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L C Issuer hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the Rescindable Amount (1) the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by such Borrower (whether or not then owed) or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or the L C Issuers, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate. 
 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 
 (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

The obligations of the Company under this Article XI shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement (other than to the extent provided for in any express, written release, amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any of this Article XI made in accordance with Section 10.01 (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations (e) the failure of the Administrative Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Obligations, if any (f) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Obligations (g) the enforceability or validity of the Obligations or any part thereof or the 
 
 4857-0343-4029 4880-4767-9669 v. 9 3 
 136 

genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Obligations, for any reason related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction purporting to prohibit the payment by such Borrower or any other guarantor of the Obligations, of any of the Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of any of the Obligations or (h) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation. 
 
 The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person. 
 
 The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the full performance and payment in cash of the Obligations), and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. 
 
 The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise. 
 
 In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, promptly but in any event within two (2) Business Days following receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and or at a place of payment other than New York, Chicago or any other Alternative Currency Payment Office and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other similar event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender, disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer or any Lender in any material respect, then, at the election of the 
 4857-0343-4029 4880-4767-9669 v. 9 3 
 137 

Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable equivalent amount in effect on the date of payment) and or in New York, Chicago or such other Alternative Currency Payment Office as is designated by the Administrative Agent and, as a separate and independent obligation, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, any L C Issuer and any Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. 
 
 Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the L C Issuers and the Lenders. 
 
 Any obligation of the Borrowers under Section 3.01 to pay any additional amounts to, or indemnify, any Lender or L C Issuer for any taxes that are required to be withheld or deducted from payments made to any Lender or to pay for, or indemnify any Lender for, any stamp and other similar taxes, shall apply mutatis mutandis (and without duplication) to the Company with respect to this Article XI and payments made hereunder. 
 
 Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment in cash of the Obligations.
