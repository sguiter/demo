Balance sheet data as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Readers of this Quarterly Report should refer to the audited financial statements of IPC Alternative Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the Company for the period ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 20, 2024, as certain footnote disclosures contained in such audited financial statements have been omitted from this Quarterly Report. 
 as a Maryland corporation and intends to elect and qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Until that time, the Company will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ). The Company was originally formed on June 17, 2021 as a Delaware limited liability company named Inland Private Capital Alternative Assets Fund, LLC and converted to a Maryland corporation on June 12, 2023. The Company is the sole general partner of IPC Alternative Real Estate Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership (originally formed under the name IPC Alternative Assets Operating Partnership, LP). The Company has no employees. Prior to August 24, 2023, the Company was managed by IPC Alternative Real Estate Advisor, LLC (the Advisor ), an affiliate of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation IREIC ), pursuant to a Business Management Agreement. On August 24, 2023, the Business Management Agreement was terminated and the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor entered into an advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement ), which is effective from August 1, 2023. The Company conducts substantially all of its business and owns, indirectly, substantially all of its assets through the Operating Partnership. The Company, through the Operating Partnership, will invest in stabilized, income-generating commercial real estate across alternative property types, with a non-exclusive focus on self-storage facilities, student housing properties and healthcare-related properties. Healthcare-related assets may include medical outpatient buildings, ambulatory surgery centers, senior living communities and life science and laboratory facilities. The Company, through the Operating Partnership, may also invest in value-add or other development projects in these asset classes, potentially through a variety of ownership structures including but not limited to direct ownership, joint ventures, co-investment opportunities, preferred equity positions and others. On September 28, 2023, the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-272750) with respect to the Company s public offering was declared effective by the SEC. The Company has registered an offering of up to in shares of common stock with the SEC, consisting of up to in shares in its primary offering and up to in shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the Offering ). The Company is offering to sell any combination of four classes of shares of its common stock: Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and different ongoing distribution fees. The purchase price per share for each class of common stock will vary and will generally equal the Company s prior month s net asset value NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. When the Company receives proceeds from the Offering, the Company contributes such proceeds to the Operating Partnership and receives Operating Partnership units OP Units that correspond to the classes of the shares sold. The Company accounts for the units acquired in the Operating Partnership as an equity method investment during any period that the Company s investment in the Operating Partnership is not considered significant to the Operating Partnership and expects to consolidate the Operating Partnership at such time that the Company s investment in the Operating Partnership is considered significant to the Operating Partnership, and thereafter present the results of operations on a consolidated basis. On December 1, 2023, the Company issued and sold shares of its Class I common stock Class T, Class S or Class D shares were issued or sold as of such date) in the Offering and the escrow agent released net proceeds of approximately to the Company as payment for such shares. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company holds Class T OP Units and Class I OP Units in the Operating Partnership accounted for as an equity method investment.

, which includes for the issuance of restricted units, to the Operating Partnership and received Class T OP Units and Class I OP Units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company contributed , which includes for the issuance of restricted units, to the Operating Partnership and received Class T OP Units and Class I OP Units. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period from June 12, 2023 (date of initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company contributed to the Operating Partnership and received Class I OP Units. In determining whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the Operating Partnership, the Company considered whether the Operating Partnership is a variable interest entity and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. Even though the Company has the power to direct the most significant activities impacting the economic performance of the Operating Partnership, the Company lacks the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the Operating Partnership that could potentially be significant to the Operating Partnership. As such, the Company s investment in the Operating Partnership is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Management evaluates reconsideration events as they occur. Reconsideration events include, among other criteria, changes in the capital balances of the Operating Partnership.

shares of capital stock. Of the total shares of stock authorized, shares are classified as common stock with a par value of per share, of which are classified as Class T shares, of which are classified as Class S shares, of which are classified as Class D shares, of which are classified as Class I shares and of which are classified as Class A shares, and shares are classified as preferred stock with a par value of per share. On June 12, 2023, the Company was capitalized with a investment by IREIC, as the sponsor, in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock. On August 10, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment and Restatement with the State Department of Taxation and Assessments of Maryland amending and restating its charter and converting each share of its issued and outstanding common stock to issued and outstanding share of Class I common stock. On August 22, 2023, the Company effected a stock split in the form of a stock dividend of shares for each of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock resulting in Class I shares issued and outstanding. On December 1, 2023, the Company issued and sold shares of its Class I common stock Class T, Class S or Class D shares were issued or sold as of such date) in the Offering and the escrow agent released net proceeds of approximately to the Company as payment for such shares. The Company is not offering Class A shares in the Offering, and the Company had Class A shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024. However, pursuant to the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement, after holding OP Units for at least (or such shorter period as consented to by the Company), OP Unit holders have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such OP Units for, at the Company s discretion, cash or common stock. If the Company were to issue shares in exchange for Class A OP Units, the Company would expect to issue Class A shares with economic features that mirror those of Class A OP Units, including class-specific allocations for the management fee to the Company s Advisor and the performance participation allocation to IPC REIT Special Limited Partner, LP (the Special Limited Partner ). See Note 6 Transactions with Related Parties for further information. Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan DRP whereby stockholders (other than Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington investors and clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in the DRP) will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock unless they elect to receive their distributions in cash. Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington investors and clients of certain participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in the DRP will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock. The purchase price for shares purchased under the DRP will be equal to the transaction price for such shares at the time the distribution is payable, which will generally be equal to the Company s prior month s NAV per share for that share class. Stockholders will not pay upfront selling commissions or dealer manager fees when purchasing shares under the DRP; however, all outstanding Class T, Class S and Class D shares, including those purchased under the DRP, will be subject to ongoing distribution fees. The distribution fees with respect to shares of the Company s Class T shares, Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the Company s NAV for those shares and may reduce the NAV or, alternatively, the distributions payable with respect to shares of each such class, including shares issued in respect of distributions on such shares under the DRP.

and of distributions reinvested through the DRP during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. There were distributions reinvested through the DRP during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and during the period June 12, 2023 (date of initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023. Share Repurchase Plan The Company has adopted a share repurchase plan SRP ), whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their shares. The Company may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in its discretion, subject to any limitations in the SRP. The total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class T, Class S, Class D, and Class I shares will be limited to of the aggregate NAV per month and of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter. Shares would be repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any early repurchase deduction. Shares that have not been outstanding for at least would be repurchased at of the transaction price. In the event that the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to issue Class A shares to holders of OP Units seeking redemption, the Company expects to amend the SRP to address the repurchase of Class A shares on the same terms that are applicable to the Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shares. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, the Company may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and has established limitations on the amount of funds the Company may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter. Further, the board of directors of the Company may modify or suspend the SRP if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest. There were repurchases through the SRP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no repurchases through the SRP for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period June 12, 2023 (date of initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023.

 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation that intends to invest in a diversified portfolio of stabilized, income-generating commercial real estate across alternative property types, with a non-exclusive focus on self-storage facilities, student housing properties and healthcare-related properties. Healthcare-related assets may include medical outpatient buildings, ambulatory surgery centers, senior living communities and life science and laboratory facilities. We may also invest in value-add or other development projects in these asset classes, potentially through a variety of ownership structures including but not limited to direct ownership, joint ventures, co-investment opportunities, preferred equity positions and others. We were originally formed on June 17, 2021, as a Delaware limited liability company named Inland Private Capital Alternative Assets Fund, LLC. We converted to a Maryland corporation on June 12, 2023 and intend to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Until that time, we will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We had little or no taxable income for the taxable year ending December 31, 2023. We are the sole general partner of IPC Alternative Real Estate Operating Partnership, LP (formerly known as IPC Alternative Assets Operating Partnership, LP) (the Operating Partnership ). 
 On September 28, 2023, the SEC declared our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-272750) for our public offering of common stock effective. We have registered a public offering of up to 1.25 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to 1.0 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to 250 million shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the Offering ). We are offering to sell any combination of four classes of shares of our common stock, Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and different ongoing distribution fees. The purchase price per share for each class of common stock will vary and will generally equal our prior month s net asset value NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. 
 As of December 1, 2023, we had satisfied the minimum offering requirement in all states, except the State of Pennsylvania, and authorized the release of proceeds from escrow. Subscriptions from Pennsylvania residents will not be released from escrow until (i) we have received, prior to the termination of our primary offering, purchase orders from all sources for at least 62.5 million (including subscription orders by residents of other jurisdictions and by The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, Inland ), its affiliates and our directors and officers) of shares of our common stock in any combination of purchases of Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares and/or (ii) we obtain, prior to the termination of our primary offering, 62.5 million in assets (including by consolidating the Operating Partnership in our financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP )). 
 17 

Other than our investment in the Operating Partnership as described below, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues through September 30, 2024. Our entire activity from inception through September 30, 2024 primarily consists of investment in the Operating Partnership, allocation of income (loss) and receipt of distributions from the Operating Partnership and distributions paid to our common stockholders. When we receive proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in the Offering, we contribute such proceeds to the Operating Partnership and receive Operating Partnership units OP Units that correspond to the classes of our shares sold. As of September 30, 2024, we hold 4,351 Class T OP Units and 139,000 Class I OP Units, representing a total of 2.5 interest in the Operating Partnership. We account for the units acquired in the Operating Partnership as an equity method investment during any period our investment in the Operating Partnership is not considered significant to the Operating Partnership and will consolidate the Operating Partnership at such time our investment in the Operating Partnership is considered significant to the Operating Partnership (based on GAAP), and thereafter present the results of operations on a consolidated basis. We expect to invest our capital and all our Offering proceeds in the Operating Partnership and hold no other assets other than OP Units. We therefore expect to eventually consolidate the Operating Partnership, and we have included financial statements of the Operating Partnership in Part II Item 5 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as we believe a discussion of the performance and results of operations of the Operating Partnership would be meaningful to investors as our cash flows and operating results are driven by the Operating Partnership, and subsequent invested capital will be significant to the Company. 
 The Operating Partnership 
 The Operating Partnership was originally formed on June 21, 2021 as a Delaware limited partnership. The Operating Partnership acquired 30 medical outpatient properties on September 2, 2021 through a roll-up transaction with eight separate programs sponsored by an affiliate of the Company s sponsor. In exchange for the properties, the Operating Partnership issued 373,033 OP Units (prior to the unit split as described below) to the Delaware statutory trusts that owned the properties, which were subsequently distributed to the investors in those trusts. In addition, on December 1, 2022, the Operating Partnership acquired City Lofts on Laclede Student Housing University Lofts in St. Louis, MO for a purchase price of 39.1 million, including the assumed Parkway UL Mortgage Loan (as defined below) of 22 million, which was the original principal amount of the loan, in connection with the acquisition. Effective July 31, 2023, the Operating Partnership effected a unit split for each OP Unit resulting in 5,815,959 Class A OP Units outstanding. The Operating Partnership has no employees. 
 On April 5, 2024, the Operating Partnership acquired four self-storage properties (the Storage V Properties from an affiliate of the Company, for a total purchase price of 43.8 million, including 17.6 million of assumed loans and corresponding swaps with First Merchants Bank. Storage V Properties are comprised of 2,275 storage units, including 1,810 climate-controlled units, that encompass 250,610 square feet. On April 26, 2024, the Operating Partnership entered into a loan agreement with Parkway Bank and Trust Company Parkway for an aggregate principal amount of 28 million (the Parkway Storage V Mortgage Loan ). The proceeds of the Parkway Storage V Mortgage Loan were used to repay the assumed loans and settle the corresponding swaps with First Merchants Bank. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a Business Management Agreement with IPC Alternative Assets Business Manager, LLC, effective as of July 14, 2021. Effective as of October 1, 2022, the Business Management Agreement was transferred from IPC Alternative Assets Business Manager, LLC to our advisor, IPC Alternative Real Estate Advisor, LLC (the Advisor ). There were no updates to the terms of the Business Management Agreement as a result of the transfer. The Business Management Agreement was terminated on August 24, 2023 and the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor entered into an advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement ), which is effective from August 1, 2023. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is responsible for sourcing, evaluating and monitoring the Company s and the Operating Partnership s investment opportunities and making decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of the Company s and Operating Partnership s assets, in accordance with the Company s investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by the Company s board of directors. The Advisory Agreement provides that the Operating Partnership or the Company will pay the Advisor a management fee equal to (i) 1.25 of aggregate NAV of the Operating Partnership attributable to outstanding Class T OP Units, Class S OP Units, Class D OP Units and Class I OP Units of the Operating Partnership and (ii) 0.50 of the aggregate NAV of the Operating Partnership attributable to outstanding Class A OP Units, in each case per annum payable monthly in arrears. The management fee may be paid, at the Advisor s election, in cash, Class I shares of the Company or Class I OP Units of the Operating Partnership. 
 The Operating Partnership is governed by the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership, dated June 27, 2024 (as may be amended or restated from time to time, the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement ). On August 24, 2023, IPC REIT Special Limited Partner, LP (the Special Limited Partner ), an affiliate, was admitted as a limited partner of the Operating Partnership and the Special Limited Partner contributed 10,000 for a performance participation interest in the Operating Partnership. The Special Limited Partner s performance participation interest in the Operating Partnership entitles it to receive an allocation of Total Return and Class A Total Return. Total Return is defined as distributions paid or accrued on OP Units (excluding Class A OP Units) plus the change in the NAV of such OP Units (excluding Class A OP Units), adjusted for subscriptions and repurchases. Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the annual Total Return will be allocated solely to the Special Limited Partner only after the Class T OP Unit, Class S OP Unit, Class D OP Unit and Class I OP Unit holders have received 
 18 

a total return of 5 (after recouping any loss carryforward amount) and such allocation will continue until the allocation between the Special Limited Partner and all other such OP Unit holders is equal to 12.5 and 87.5 , respectively. Thereafter, the Special Limited Partner will receive an allocation of 12.5 of the annual Total Return. Class A Total Return is defined as distributions paid or accrued on Class A OP Units plus the change in the NAV of such Class A OP Units, adjusted for subscriptions and repurchases. Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the annual Class A Total Return will be allocated solely to the Special Limited Partner only after the Class A OP Unit holders have received a total return of 5 (after recouping any loss carryforward amount) and such allocation will continue until the allocation between the Special Limited Partner and all other unit holders is equal to 12.5 and 87.5 , respectively. Thereafter, the Special Limited Partner will receive an allocation of 12.5 of the annual Class A Total Return. 
 The Operating Partnership is primarily focused on investing in a diversified portfolio of stabilized, income-generating commercial real estate across alternative property types, with a non-exclusive focus on self-storage facilities, student housing properties and healthcare-related properties. Healthcare-related assets may include medical outpatient buildings, ambulatory surgery centers, senior living communities and life science and laboratory facilities. The Operating Partnership may also invest in value-add or other development projects in these asset classes, potentially through a variety of ownership structures including but not limited to direct ownership, joint ventures, co-investment opportunities, preferred equity positions and others. In the initial stages of our capital raise pursuant to the Offering, a primary source of proposed real estate investments will consist of DST or other private investment programs sponsored by IPC, an affiliate of our sponsor. These investments are expected to take the form of a transaction structured as a tax-deferred contribution of the property owned by the DST or other IPC-sponsored investment program to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units under Section 721 of the Code. In particular, on June 27, 2024, IPC launched a program (the DST Program through which it expects to sponsor a series of private placements exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of beneficial interests in specific DSTs owning one or more real properties. In connection with the DST Program, the Operating Partnership will receive a fair market value purchase option with respect to each DST, giving the Operating Partnership the option, but not the obligation, exercisable in the Operating Partnership s sole and absolute discretion, to require DST investors to exchange their DST interests for Class T OP Units, Class S OP Units, Class D OP Units, Class I OP Units, or, in limited circumstances at the discretion of the Operating Partnership, cash, which option may be exercised during the three, three-month periods that begin on the 24-month, 36-month and 48-month anniversary of the final closing of the sale of DST interests pursuant to each private placement. 
 The following discussion and analysis is based on the consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the Operating Partnership.

 Results of Operations Operating Partnership 
 The Operating Partnership generates primarily all of its net operating income from property operations. In order to evaluate the overall portfolio, the Operating Partnership s management analyzes the net operating income of properties that the Operating Partnership owns and operates. Net operating income is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that the Operating Partnership believes is useful to investors in measuring the operating performance of the Operating Partnership s property portfolio because the Operating Partnership s primary business is the ownership of real estate, and net operating income excludes various items included in GAAP net income that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, the Operating Partnership s property operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization and parent-level corporate expenses (including general and administrative expenses). 
 The Operating Partnership considers property net operating income an important supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. Although property net operating income is a widely used measure among REITs, there can be no assurance that property net operating income presented by the Operating Partnership is comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other REITs. 
 The Operating Partnership calculates property net operating income using net income and excluding general and administrative expenses, advisor management fee, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest or other income. 
 The following tables present the property net operating income broken out between same store and non-same store for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, prior to general and administrative expenses, advisor management fee, depreciation and amortization, and interest, along with a reconciliation to net (loss) income, calculated in accordance with GAAP. A total of 30 medical outpatient properties with 32 operating leases and one student housing property that were acquired before January 1, 2023 represent same store in the tables below. Non-same store, as reflected in the tables below, consist of properties acquired after January 1, 2023. Four self-storage properties were acquired on April 5, 2024 and are included as non-same store properties.

Property net operating income. On a same store basis, comparing the results of operations of properties owned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with the results of the same properties owned during the three months ended September 30, 2023, property 
 25 

net operating income decreased 63, total property revenues increased 108, and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 171. 
 The increase in same store total property revenues is primarily due to an increase in rental income due to increased rental rates at our student housing property. 
 The increase in same store total property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, an increase in insurance expense and an increase in legal expenses in 2024. 
 Non-same store total property net operating income increased 496 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase is a result of acquiring four self-storage properties on April 5, 2024. On a non-same store basis, total property revenues increased 925 and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 429 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 as a result of this acquisition. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 292 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll reimbursement to the Advisor and legal and professional costs. 
 Advisor management fee. Advisor management fees decreased 20 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the new Advisory Agreement in place effective August 1, 2023, which resulted in a lower fee. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 1,288 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of four self-storage properties. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense increased 927 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in debt and proceeds from the Credit Facility and higher amortization of derivatives costs. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income decreased 5 in 2024 compared to 2023.

 26 

net operating income decreased 873, total property revenues decreased 556, and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 317. 
 The decrease in same store total property revenues is primarily due to less cash rent paid by our cash basis tenant in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 The increase in same store total property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in insurance, legal and repairs and maintenance expenses in 2024. 
 Non-same store total property net operating income increased 1,093 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase is a result of acquiring four self-storage properties on April 5, 2024. On a non-same store basis, total property revenues increased 1,842 and total property operating expenses including real estate tax expense increased 749 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 as a result of this acquisition. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 1,748 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll reimbursement to the Advisor and legal and professional costs. 
 Advisor management fee. Advisor management fees decreased 149 in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the new Advisory Agreement in place effective August 1, 2023, which resulted in a lower fee. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 1,376 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of four self-storage properties partially offset by fully amortized assets. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense increased 2,066 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in debt and proceeds from the Credit Facility and higher amortization of derivatives costs. 
 Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased 177 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to realized gain on termination of swaps that were acquired with the self-storage properties.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Operating Partnership 
 Accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes the value of real estate assets is reduced over time due primarily to non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. Because real estate values may rise and fall with market conditions, operating results from real estate companies that use GAAP accounting may not present a complete view of their performance. The Operating Partnership uses Funds from Operations, or FFO , a non-GAAP metric to evaluate its performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare the Operating Partnership s performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT , has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which the Operating Partnership believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT and presented below, is net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, excluding impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate and excluding gains and losses from change in control. 
 The Operating Partnership also believes that adjusted FFO AFFO is an additional meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of its operating results. AFFO further adjusts FFO to reflect the performance of the Operating Partnership s portfolio by adjusting for items the Operating Partnership believes are not directly attributable to its operations. The Operating Partnership s adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impact of (i) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (ii) straight-line income and expense, (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iv) amortization of mortgage premium/discount, and (v) amortization of derivatives costs. 
 The Operating Partnership s presentation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. The Operating Partnership believes that the use of FFO and AFFO provides a more complete understanding of its operating performance to unitholders, investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on its operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor AFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of the Operating Partnership s capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and AFFO to compare the Operating Partnership s operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess its operating performance. 
 FFO and AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are calculated as follows:

Net Asset Value 
 We calculate our NAV each month in accordance with valuation guidelines approved by our board of directors. NAV is not a measure used under GAAP and the valuations of and certain adjustments made to our assets and liabilities used in the determination of NAV will differ from GAAP. Stockholders should not consider NAV to be equivalent to stockholders equity or any other GAAP measure. Please refer to Exhibit 4.3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on how our NAV is determined. 
 Our total NAV presented in the following tables shows the Company and the Operating Partnership on a combined basis and includes the NAV of the Company s common stockholders, as well as partnership interests of the Operating Partnership held by parties other than us.

For purposes of calculating NAV, we recognize the distribution fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the distribution fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T shares and units, Class S shares and units, and Class D shares and units. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued under GAAP 16 of distribution fees payable to Inland Securities Corporation (the Dealer Manager related to the Class T shares and units. As of September 30, 2024, we had not sold or issued any Class S shares or units or Class D shares or units and, therefore, we had not accrued any distribution fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to such shares or units. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers.

Cash flows from operating activities 

During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 12, 2023 (date of initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, 100 of our distributions were funded by the Operating Partnership, which used its cash flows generated from operations to fund these distributions. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 The Company s and the Operating Partnership s accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies which is included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the December 31, 2023 Notes to Financial Statements which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Operating Partnership s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies which is included in the Operating Partnership s September 30, 2024 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 5 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the December 31, 2023 Notes to Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company has identified Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and the Operating Partnership has identified Purchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate and Impairment of Investment Properties as critical accounting policies. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership consider these policies to be critical because they require the Company s and the Operating Partnership s management to use judgment in the application of the accounting policy, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of the Company s and the Operating Partnership s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 The Company 
 Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
 The Company s investments in unconsolidated entities are periodically assessed for impairment and an impairment loss is recorded when the fair value of the investment falls below the carrying value and such decline is determined to be other-than-temporary. The evaluation of an investment in an unconsolidated entity for potential impairment can require the Company to exercise significant judgment. 
 Refer to Exhibit 4.3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on the assumptions and estimates used in determination of fair value of the Company s investment in the Operating Partnership. 
 The Operating Partnership 
 Purchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate 
 The Operating Partnership generally accounts for the acquisition of real estate as an asset acquisition which requires that the Operating Partnership assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The cost of the acquisition is then allocated to the assets acquired and 
 31 

liabilities assumed based on their relative estimated fair values. The Operating Partnership assesses relative fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that the Operating Partnership deems appropriate, as well as other available market information. The Operating Partnership estimates future cash flows based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. Valuation is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions, such as comparable sales values, discount rates, capitalization rates, revenue and expense growth rates and lease-up assumptions, at a particular point in time. 
 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The Operating Partnership also considers an allocation of purchase price to acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. 
 The Operating Partnership records acquired above-market and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid under each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Operating Partnership s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. When estimating carrying costs, the Operating Partnership includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. When estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Operating Partnership considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 
 Impairment of Investment Properties 
 The Operating Partnership assesses the carrying values of long-lived assets each quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The evaluation of anticipated future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding the economic condition of the property at a particular point in time, future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the Operating Partnership will be required to record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Operating Partnership had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The Company does not consolidate the Operating Partnership.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 The Company, through its investment in the Operating Partnership, is exposed to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and commodity prices. The Operating Partnership does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Operating Partnership has entered into, and may continue to enter into, financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates. The counterparties are, and are expected to continue to be, major financial institutions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company, through its investment in the Operating Partnership, is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to purchase properties or other real estate assets and to fund capital expenditures. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Operating Partnership had outstanding debt of 273.4 million and 239.3 million, respectively, excluding the discount on assumed mortgage loan and unamortized debt issuance costs, bearing rates ranging from 2.97 to 5.80 per annum and 2.97 to 4.10 per annum, respectively. The weighted average interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.03 and 3.60 , respectively, which includes the effect of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average years to maturity for the mortgages was 1.9 years and 2.6 years, respectively. 
 The following table sets forth the summary of the Operating Partnership s debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discount on assumed mortgage loan (as applicable), as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of September 30, 2024 increased by 1 (100 basis points) or decreased by 1 (100 basis points), there would be no impact to the earnings and cash flows as the 1 increase or 1 decrease in interest expense on the debt would be fully offset by the corresponding increase or reduction in payments from the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. 
 If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of December 31, 2023 increased by 1 (100 basis points) or decreased by 1 (100 basis points), there would be no impact to the earnings and cash flows as the 1 increase or 1 decrease in interest expense on the debt would be fully offset by the corresponding increase or reduction in payments from the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. 
 With regard to variable rate financing, the Advisor assesses the Operating Partnership s interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. The Advisor maintains risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both of the outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as the potential offsetting hedge positions of the Operating Partnership. 
 The Operating Partnership uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by the Operating Partnership s assets. Derivative instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements. The Operating Partnership s actual hedging decisions are determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge. The Operating Partnership has used derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap contracts, to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt, which exposes the Operating Partnership to both credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe the Operating Partnership, which creates credit risk for the Operating Partnership because the counterparty may not perform. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Operating Partnership seeks to manage the 
 33 

market risk associated with interest-rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. There is no assurance the Operating Partnership will be successful. 
 Derivatives 
 For information related to derivatives, reference is made to Note 5 Debt and Derivative Instruments which is included in the Operating Partnership s September 30, 2024 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 5 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Part II - Other Information 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings 
 Neither we nor the Operating Partnership is a party to, and none of the Operating Partnership s properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 There were no material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Securities 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 On August 1, 2024, we issued 1,090 restricted shares of Class I common stock to Ella S. Neyland, with a grant date fair value of 27,125, 1,155 restricted shares of Class I common stock to Michael W. Reid, with a grant date fair value of 28,750, and 1,090 restricted shares of Class I common stock to Daniel Rigby, with a grant date fair value of 27,125, as part of their director compensation. Restricted stock issued to independent directors will generally vest one year from the date of grant and become fully vested earlier upon a liquidity event or upon the termination of a director by reason of his or her death or disability. These issuances were consummated without registration under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 Other than mentioned above, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell or issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 We have registered with the SEC an Offering up to 1.25 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to 1 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to 250 million in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. On September 28, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-272750) with respect to our Offering was declared effective by the SEC.

 We also pay our Dealer Manager distribution fees with respect to Class T, Class S and Class D shares sold in the Offering, but such fees are funded by the Operating Partnership from its operations rather than the Offering proceeds. 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from such sales to acquire a diversified portfolio of stabilized, income-generating commercial real estate across alternative property types, with a non-exclusive focus on self-storage facilities, student housing properties and healthcare-related properties. 
 We contributed the net proceeds from the Offering to the Operating Partnership and received OP Units that correspond to the classes of the shares sold. The Operating Partnership primarily used the proceeds for general corporate expenses. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 We adopted the share repurchase plan SRP ), whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the SRP. The total amount of aggregate repurchases of Class T, Class S, Class D, and Class I shares will be limited to 2 of the aggregate NAV per month and 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter. Shares will be repurchased at a price equal to the Transaction Price (as defined in the SRP) on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any early repurchase deduction. Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 95 of the Transaction Price. Stockholders who have received shares of our common stock in exchange for OP Units may include the period of time such stockholder held such OP Units for purposes of calculating the holding period for such shares of our common stock. In the event that we, at our sole discretion, elect to issue Class A shares to holders of OP Units seeking redemption, we expect to amend the SRP to address the repurchase of Class A shares on the same terms that are applicable to the Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I shares. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and have established limitations on the amount of funds we may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter. Further, our board of directors may modify or suspend the SRP if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest. We began the SRP in January 2024, the first month of the first full calendar quarter following the conclusion of our escrow period. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no repurchases of shares of our common stock. 
 Item 3. Defaults Up on Senior Securities 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures 
 Not Applicable.

Item 5. Othe r Information 
 Trading Arrangements 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , none of the Company s directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of the Company s securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 
 Financial Statements of the Operating Partnership 
 We account for the units acquired in the Operating Partnership as an equity method investment during any period our investment in the Operating Partnership is not considered significant to the Operating Partnership and will consolidate the Operating Partnership at such time our investment in the Operating Partnership is considered significant to the Operating Partnership (based on generally accepted accounting principles), and thereafter present the results of operations on a consolidated basis. We expect to invest our capital and all our Offering proceeds in the Operating Partnership and hold no other assets other than OP Units. We therefore expect to eventually consolidate the Operating Partnership. As such, we have included unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as we believe these financial statements would be meaningful to investors, and subsequent invested capital will be significant to us.

 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION 
 The Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, was formed on June 21, 2021 and commenced operations on September 2, 2021. On June 12, 2023, the Operating Partnership changed its name from IPC Alternative Assets Operating Partnership, LP to IPC Alternative Real Estate Operating Partnership, LP. IPC Alternative Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the General Partner ), formerly known as Inland Private Capital Alternative Assets Fund, LLC, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The General Partner converted to a Maryland corporation effective June 12, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership owned 30 medical outpatient building properties totaling 746,601 square feet, four self-storage properties totaling 250,755 square feet and one student housing property with 406 student housing beds. The properties are located in 12 states. The Operating Partnership has no employees. Until September 30, 2022, the Operating Partnership was externally managed by IPC Alternative Assets Business Manager, LLC, an affiliate of Inland Private Capital Corporation IPC ), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to a Business Management Agreement. Effective as of October 1, 2022, the Business Management Agreement was transferred from IPC Alternative Assets Business Manager, LLC to IPC Alternative Real Estate Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation IREIC ). There were no updates to the terms of the Business Management Agreement as a result of the transfer. On August 24, 2023, the Business Management Agreement was terminated and the General Partner, the Operating Partnership and IPC Alternative Real Estate Advisor, LLC entered into an advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement ), which is effective from August 1, 2023. IPC Alternative Assets Business Manager, LLC, until September 30, 2022, and IPC Alternative Real Estate Advisor, LLC, effective October 1, 2022, are referred to herein as the Advisor. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is responsible for sourcing, evaluating and monitoring the General Partner s and the Operating Partnership s investment opportunities and making decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of the General Partner s and Operating Partnership s assets, in accordance with the General Partner s investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by the General Partner s board of directors. 
 On September 28, 2023, the General Partner s registration statement (the Registration Statement on Form S-11 to register up to 1,250,000 in shares of common stock under a blind pool offering was declared effective by the SEC. The General Partner will contribute the proceeds from the offering to the Operating Partnership. The General Partner intends to elect and qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ending December 31, 2024. Until that time, the General Partner will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The total amount of interest expense presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss was 10,686 and 8,620 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The location of the net gain or loss reclassified into income from accumulated other comprehensive income is reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The amount that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income in the next 12 months is 3,048. 
 NOTE 6 EQUITY 
 The Operating Partnership s capital includes general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership referred to as General Partner s capital and Limited Partners capital, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of partners capital. The General Partner and the Limited Partners are collectively referred to as Partners. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, other than the Special Limited Partner (as defined in Note 10) interest and General Partner interest, are currently divided into five classes of units: (a) Class T OP Units; (b) Class S OP Units; (c) Class D OP Units; (d) Class I OP Units; and (e) Class A OP Units. In general, the Class T OP Units, Class S OP Units, Class D OP Units and Class I OP Units issued to the General Partner are intended to correspond on a one-for-one basis with the General Partner s Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares. Similarly, Class A OP Units issued to the General Partner are intended to correspond on a one-for-one basis with the General Partner s Class A shares if the General Partner issues Class A shares in connection with a Class A OP Unit redemption request. When the General Partner receives proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock, the General Partner contributes such proceeds to the Operating Partnership and receives OP Units that correspond to the classes of the shares sold in the offering. Additionally, the Operating Partnership may issue any of these classes of OP Units to its Limited Partners. See Note 10 Transactions with Related Parties for further information on management fees and performance participation allocation for each of the classes of OP Units. 
 Effective July 31, 2023, in contemplation of the Registration Statement as discussed in Note 1, the Operating Partnership effected a unit split for each OP Unit resulting in 5,815,959 Class A OP Units outstanding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 4,351 Class T OP Units and 139,000 Class I OP Units issued to the General Partner. As of September 30, 2023, there were 8,000 Class I OP Units issued to the General Partner. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no General Partner interests issued to the General Partner. 
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, OP unitholders may request redemption of all or a portion of their units after holding those units for at least two years (or such shorter period as consented to by the General Partner in its sole discretion). The General Partner has discretion to accept or reject redemption requests and whether accepted redemptions will be redeemed for cash or shares in the General Partner. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain Class A OP unitholders requested redemption of their units as shown in the tables below, all of which the General Partner accepted and agreed to redeem for cash. As of September 30, 2024, 480 in redemptions payable are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 8 LEASES 
 Rental Revenue as a Lessor 
 The Operating Partnership leases its 30 medical outpatient properties, four self-storage properties and one student housing property under long-term and short-term operating leases. The remaining lease terms for the Operating Partnership s medical outpatient leases, as of September 30, 2024, range from 3.4 years to 13.4 years. The leases for self-storage units generally are on a month-to-month basis. The lease terms for the Operating Partnership s student housing leases generally approximate one year. 
 Medical outpatient leases require the tenant to pay fixed base rent paid monthly in advance, and to reimburse the Operating Partnership for the tenant s pro rata share of certain operating expenses including real estate taxes, special assessments, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance, management fees, and certain building repairs paid by the Operating Partnership and recoverable under the terms of the lease. Under these leases, the Operating Partnership pays all expenses and is reimbursed by the tenant for the tenant s pro rata share of recoverable expenses paid. Self-storage units are leased to individual tenants under lease agreements, which generally are on a month-to-month basis. Student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis and require the tenant to pay fixed base rent paid monthly in advance, and to reimburse the Operating Partnership for certain costs, primarily the tenant s share of utilities expenses, incurred by the Operating Partnership. Under leases where all expenses are paid by the Operating Partnership, subject to reimbursement by the tenant, the expenses are included within property operating expenses. As per ASC 842, reimbursements for common area maintenance are considered non-lease components that are permitted to be combined with rental revenue. The combined lease component and reimbursements for insurance and taxes are reported as rental revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Certain other tenants are subject to net leases which provide that the tenant is responsible for fixed base rent as well as all costs and expenses associated with occupancy. Under net leases where all expenses are paid directly by the tenant rather than the landlord, such expenses are not included on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Rental revenue related to the Operating Partnership s operating leases is comprised of the following:

Performance Participation Allocation 
 The Operating Partnership is governed by the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership, dated June 27, 2024 (as may be amended or restated from time to time, the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement ). 
 On August 24, 2023, the General Partner admitted IPC REIT Special Limited Partner, LP (the Special Limited Partner ), an affiliate, as a limited partner of the Operating Partnership and the Special Limited Partner contributed 10 for a performance participation interest in the Operating Partnership. The Special Limited Partner s performance participation interest in the Operating Partnership entitles the Special Limited Partner to receive an allocation of Total Return and Class A Total Return. Total Return is defined as distributions paid or accrued on OP Units (excluding Class A OP Units) plus the change in the NAV of such OP Units (excluding Class A OP Units), adjusted for subscriptions and repurchases. Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the annual Total Return will be allocated solely to the Special Limited Partner only after the Class T OP Unit, Class S OP Unit, Class D OP Unit and Class I OP Unit holders have received a total return of 5 (after recouping any loss carryforward amount) and such allocation will continue until the allocation between the Special Limited Partner and all other such OP Unit holders is equal to 12.5 and 87.5 , respectively. Thereafter, the Special Limited Partner will receive an allocation of 12.5 of the annual Total Return. Class A Total Return is defined as distributions paid or accrued on Class A OP Units plus the change in the NAV of such Class A OP Units, adjusted for subscriptions and repurchases. Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the annual Class A Total Return will be allocated solely to the Special Limited Partner only after the Class A OP Unit holders have received a total return of 5 (after recouping any loss carryforward amount) and such allocation will continue until the allocation between the Special Limited Partner and all other unit holders is equal to 12.5 and 87.5 , respectively. Thereafter, the Special Limited Partner will receive an allocation of 12.5 of the annual Class A Total Return. The performance participation allocations are subject to a loss carryforward which initially equaled zero and is cumulatively increased by the absolute value of any negative annual Total Return or Class A Total Return (as applicable) and decreased by any positive annual Total Return or Class A Total Return (as applicable), provided that the loss carryforward amount shall at no time be less than zero and provided further that the calculation of the loss carryforward amount will exclude the Total Return or Class A Total Return (as applicable) related to any OP Units redeemed during the year, which are subject to the performance participation allocation upon redemption. As of September 30, 2024, the Special Limited Partner had not accrued a performance participation allocation. 
 Related Party Line of Credit 
 On October 27, 2023, the Operating Partnership entered into a revolving credit facility loan agreement (the Credit Agreement and a revolving promissory note (the Promissory Note, and together with the credit agreement, the Credit Facility with IPC, as lender. 
 58 

The Credit Facility provides for loan advances in an aggregate amount not to exceed 22,500, with a maturity date of November 30, 2024 (as may be amended, modified, extended or renewed, but not accelerated, in IPC s sole discretion) or the date IPC declares obligations under the Credit Facility, or the obligations become, due and payable after the occurrence of an event of default (the Loan ). The daily balance of the Loan under the Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of 4.25 per annum, however in connection with the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default (and at IPC s option for all other events of default), the interest rate will increase to 9.25 per annum. The Operating Partnership has the right to prepay all or any part of the Loan at any time upon five days notice to IPC. The Credit Facility acts in the manner of a revolving credit facility wherein prepayments from the Operating Partnership shall be available for funding future advances to the Operating Partnership. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had an outstanding balance of 10,000 on the Credit Facility. 
 Class A OP Units held by Affiliates 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 75,484 Class A OP Units, which represents 1.35 and 1.31 , respectively, of the total Class A OP Units, were held by IPC and its affiliates. 
 Due from Related Parties 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 0 and 166, respectively, of cash due from an affiliate is included in due from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 DST Program 
 On June 27, 2024, IPC launched the DST Program, through which it expects to sponsor a series of private placements exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of beneficial interests in specific DSTs owning one or more real properties. The DST Program is designed for, but not limited to, prospective investors seeking to defer the recognition of gain on the sale of other real property under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In connection with the DST Program, the Operating Partnership, each DST, and each DST investor will enter into an option agreement pursuant to which the Operating Partnership will be granted the option (the FMV Option ), but not the obligation, exercisable in the Operating Partnership s sole and absolute discretion, to require such DST investor to exchange his, her or its DST interest for Class T OP Units, Class S OP Units, Class D OP Units, Class I OP Units, or, in limited circumstances at the discretion of the Operating Partnership, cash, which option may be exercised during the three, three-month periods that begin on the 24-month, 36-month and 48-month anniversary of the final closing of the sale of DST interests pursuant to each private placement. 
 In connection with each private placement, each DST, the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Dealer Manager will enter into a placement agent agreement pursuant to which the Dealer Manager, as placement agent, will offer and sell beneficial interest in the applicable DST. The General Partner and the Operating Partnership are only party to such placement agent agreement for the limited purpose of paying the distribution fees that may be payable to the Dealer Manager in connection with an exercise of the FMV Option. As part of the DST Program, the General Partner and the Operating Partnership will offer to those DST investors that receive OP Units the opportunity to enter into a tax protection agreement. 
 In connection with the DST Program, IPC, the General Partner and the Operating Partnership entered into a letter agreement (the Indemnification Agreement on June 27, 2024 pursuant to which parties provide mutual indemnification obligations with respect to the private placements sponsored by IPC. Under the Indemnification Agreement, the General Partner and the Operating Partnership have agreed to indemnify IPC, its officer and directors, and each person, if any, who controls IPC within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any and all Loss (as defined in the Indemnification Agreement) caused by or based on: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact relating to the General Partner or the Operating Partnership which was furnished or approved by the General Partner or the Operating Partnership specifically for inclusion in, and actually contained in the offering materials related to the private placements but specifically excluding any tax consequences related to the OP Units (collectively, the General Partner Information and (ii) the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact regarding the General Partner or the Operating Partnership required to be stated in the General Partner Information (excluding any tax consequences related to the OP Units) or necessary to make the statements in the General Partner Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
 Other assets 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other assets includes 1 and 0, respectively, of prepaid expenses to Devon.

NOTE 11 EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
 As a result of the restricted share grants by the General Partner to its independent directors, the Operating Partnership issued 2,387 Class I restricted units to the General Partner on March 19, 2024 and 3,335 Class I restricted units to the General Partner on August 1, 2024. Compensation expense associated with the restricted units is recognized by the Operating Partnership over a one-year period from the date of the grant. Compensation expense associated with the restricted units issued to the General Partner was 35 and 66 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the General Partner had 94 of unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted units, in the aggregate. The weighted average remaining period that unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted units will be recognized is 0.74 years. 
 NOTE 12 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
 The Operating Partnership defines fair value based on the price that it believes would be received upon sale of an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Operating Partnership establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below: 

Level 1 
 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. 

Level 2 
 
 Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3 
 
 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 

The Operating Partnership has estimated the fair value of its financial and non-financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies the Operating Partnership believes to be appropriate for these purposes. 
 Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the table below presents the fair value of the Operating Partnership s cash flow hedges as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The fair value of derivative instruments was estimated based on data observed in the forward yield curve which is widely observed in the marketplace. The Operating Partnership also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements which utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads. The Operating Partnership has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements and therefore has classified these in Level 2 of the hierarchy. 
 NOTE 13 SEGMENT REPORTING 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership operates in three reportable segments: Healthcare, Self-Storage and Education. During the second quarter of 2023, the Operating Partnership retitled the Student Housing segment to Education. The Operating Partnership assesses performance and makes operational decisions based on the performance of each segment individually. The Operating Partnership believes that segment net operating income is a key performance metric that captures the unique operating 
 60 

characteristics of each segment. The Operating Partnership defines segment net operating income as total revenues less property operating expenses and real estate tax expense attributable to the segment. 
 Prior to the acquisition of Storage V Properties on April 5, 2024, the Operating Partnership managed its operations in two reportable segments: Healthcare and Education. Prior to the acquisition of University Lofts on December 1, 2022, the Operating Partnership managed its operations on an aggregated, single segment basis for purposes of assessing performance and making operational decisions and, accordingly, had only one reporting and operating segment. 
 The following table details the total assets by reportable segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:
