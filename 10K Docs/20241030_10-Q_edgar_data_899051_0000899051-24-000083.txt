The employer voluntary benefits business is reported in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, and as of September 30, 2024, the assets and liabilities of the business are classified as held for sale. The transaction price less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value of the net assets related to this transaction, resulting in an 

estimated gain that will be recognized at closing of the transaction. The anticipated gain on the sale will be impacted by purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions, changes in the carrying value of net assets, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and the related tax effects. 
 The amount of goodwill included in the carrying value is based on the relative fair value of the employer voluntary benefits business to the fair value of the Allstate Health and Benefits segment and is reported in other assets in the table below.

 Portfolio monitoring and credit losses 
 Fixed income securities The Company has a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance . 
 For each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these criteria, any existing credit loss allowance would be written-off against the amortized cost basis of the asset along with any remaining unrealized losses, with incremental losses recorded in earnings. 
 If the Company has not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company calculates the estimated recovery value based on the best estimate of future cash flows considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at the security s current effective rate and is compared to the amortized cost of the security. 
 The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security is considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the 

security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, origination vintage year, geographic concentration of underlying collateral, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third-party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if the Company determines that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. 
 If the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows; however, the amortized cost, net of the credit loss allowance, may not be lower than the fair value of the security. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in AOCI. If the Company determines that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, the Company may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings. 
 When a security is sold or otherwise disposed or when the security is deemed uncollectible and written off, the Company reverses amounts previously recognized in the credit loss allowance. Recoveries after write-offs are recognized when received. Accrued interest excluded from the amortized cost of fixed income securities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is reported within the accrued

 (2) Evaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations. 
 Investment grade is defined as a security having a National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC designation of 1 or 2, which is comparable to a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody s or AAA, AA, A or BBB from S P Global Ratings S P ), or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to an increase in market yields which may include increased risk-free interest rates or wider credit spreads since the time of initial purchase. The unrealized losses are expected to reverse as the securities approach maturity. 

ABS in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on actual and projected collateral losses relative to the securities positions in the respective securitization trusts, security specific expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings. This evaluation also takes into consideration credit enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination from other classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to absorb losses before the class of security the Company owns, and (ii) the expected impact of other structural features embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the class of securities the Company owns, such as overcollateralization and excess spread. Municipal bonds in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on the underlying credit

 Bank loans When it is determined a bank loan shall be evaluated individually, the Company uses various methods to estimate credit losses on individual loans such as the present value of the loan s expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan s current effective interest rate. 

Credit ratings of the borrower are considered a key credit quality indicator when bank loan credit loss allowances are estimated. The ratings are either received from the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list or a comparable internal rating. The year of origination is determined to be the year in which the asset is acquired.

 Fair value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. The carrying value amounts for OTC derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, of enforceable master netting agreements and are presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 For those derivatives which qualify and have been designated as fair value accounting hedges, net 

income includes the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged risk. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses are amortized from AOCI and are reported in net income in the same period the forecasted transactions being hedged impact net income. 
 Non-hedge accounting is generally used for portfolio level hedging strategies where the terms of the individual hedged items do not meet the strict homogeneity requirements to permit the application of hedge accounting. For non-hedge derivatives, net income includes changes in fair value and accrued periodic settlements, when applicable. With the exception of non-hedge derivatives used for asset replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of the Company s derivatives are evaluated for their ongoing effectiveness as either accounting hedge or non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis. 
 In connection with the sale of ALIC and certain affiliates in 2021, the sale agreement included a provision related to contingent consideration that may be earned over a period with the first potential payment date commencing on January 1, 2026 and a final potential payment date of January 1, 2035. The contingent consideration is determined annually based on the average ten-year Treasury rate over the preceding three-year period compared to a designated rate. The contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative and is accounted for on a fair value basis with periodic changes in fair value reflected in earnings. There are no collateral requirements related to the contingent consideration.

 The Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements MNAs and obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses MNAs for OTC derivative transactions that permit either party to net payments due for transactions and collateral is either pledged or obtained when certain predetermined exposure limits are exceeded. 
 Pledged to the Company (1) 
 
 (1) million of collateral was posted under MNAs for contracts containing credit-risk-contingent provisions that are in a liability provision. 
 The Company has not incurred any losses on derivative financial instruments due to counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives, including futures and certain option contracts, are traded on organized exchanges which require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, thereby mitigating any potential credit risk. 

Counterparty credit exposure represents the Company s potential loss if all of the counterparties concurrently fail to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, becomes worthless. This exposure is measured by the fair value of OTC derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of legally enforceable master netting agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any counterparty credit exposure. 
 For certain exchange traded and cleared derivatives, margin deposits are required as well as daily cash settlements of margin accounts.

 Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions.

to million, pre-tax. This disclosure is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Under accounting guidance, an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. This estimate is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimate does not include matters or losses for which an estimate is not possible. Therefore, this estimate represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Company s maximum possible loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these loss contingencies. 
 Due to the complexity and scope of the matters disclosed in the Claims related proceedings and Other proceedings subsections below and the many uncertainties that exist, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted and in the Company s judgment, a loss, in excess of amounts accrued, if any, is not probable. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to the Company s operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to it, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all matters described below, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 The Allstate Corporation 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and shareholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 21, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding a change in accounting principle for the measurement and disclosure of long-duration insurance contracts. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of the interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

This is done by providing affordable, simple and connected protection through multiple distribution methods. The ultimate objective is to enhance customer value to drive growth in all businesses. 

In the personal property-liability businesses, this has five key components: 
 Improving customer value 
 Expanding customer access 
 Increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition 
 Deploying new technology ecosystem 
 Driving organizational transformation 
 We are expanding protection services businesses utilizing enterprise capabilities and resources such as the Allstate brand, distribution, analytics, claims, investment expertise, talent and capital. 
 Disposition 
 On August 13, 2024, we entered into a share purchase agreement with StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. to sell American Heritage Life Insurance Company and American Heritage Service Company, comprising our employer voluntary benefits business for approximately 2.0 billion in cash. The employer voluntary benefits business is reported in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, and as of September 30, 2024, the assets and liabilities of the business are classified as held for sale. The transaction price less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value of net assets related to this transaction, resulting in an expected gain that will be recognized at closing of the transaction. The ultimate amount of the anticipated gain on the sale will be impacted by purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions, changes in the carrying value of net assets, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and the related tax effects. 
 The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We continue to pursue the sale of the group health and individual health businesses but have not completed the sale process. Once the criteria for these businesses to be classified as held for sale is met, the entire Health and Benefits segment will be reported in discontinued operations.

Measuring segment profit or loss 
 The measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments and adjusted net income for the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other segments. We use these measures in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze profitability. 
 Underwriting income is calculated as premiums earned and other revenue, less claims and claims expense losses ), amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC ), operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles and restructuring and related charges, as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 

Adjusted net income is net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding: 
 Net gains and losses on investments and derivatives Pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses Amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles Gain or loss on disposition Adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years Income tax expense or benefit on reconciling items

 Consolidated net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders in millions) 

Consolidated net income applicable to common shareholders was 1.16 billion and 2.65 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to a loss of 41 million and 1.78 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, primarily due to improved underwriting results from increased earned premium and improved loss trends. 
 
 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, return on Allstate common shareholders equity was 26.1 . 

Total revenues 
 in millions) 

Total revenues increased 14.7 to 16.63 billion and increased 12.6 to 47.60 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023 due to premium rate increases and higher realized capital gains on investments compared to the prior year. 

Net investment income in millions) 

Net investment income increased 94 million to 783 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher market-based investment results, partially offset by lower performance-based investment results. Net investment income increased 385 million to 2.26 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher market-based investment results. Market-based results continue to benefit from portfolio repositioning into higher yielding fixed income securities and higher investment balances.

 Segment highlights 
 Allstate Protection underwriting income was 555 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an underwriting loss of 331 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to increased premiums earned and lower non-catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and advertising costs. Underwriting income totaled 1.32 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an underwriting loss of 3.42 billion in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to increased premiums earned and lower losses, partially offset by higher advertising costs. As auto profitability improves, we are increasing advertising, expanding customer access and delivering personalized affordable, simple and connected consumer offerings to support growth. 

Catastrophe losses were 1.70 billion and 4.55 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 1.18 billion and 5.57 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 
 Premiums written increased 10.5 to 14.71 billion and increased 11.8 to 42.17 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, reflecting higher premiums in both Allstate and National General brands.

Protection Services adjusted net income was 58 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 27 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to revenue growth and improved claim frequency at Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income was 167 million the first nine months of 2024 compared to 102 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to growth at Allstate Protection Plans and improved claim severity at Allstate Roadside. 
 Premiums and other revenue increased 16.3 to 749 million and increased 13.6 to 2.16 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to Allstate Protection Plans. 

Allstate Health and Benefits adjusted net income was 37 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to adjusted net income of 69 million in the third quarter of 2023, and adjusted net income was 151 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 182 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decline in adjusted net income from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to increased benefit utilization across all lines of business. 
 Premiums and contract charges increased 5.2 to 487 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 4.4 to 1.44 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to growth in individual health and group health, partially offset by a decline in employer voluntary benefits.

Property-Liability Operations 

 Property-Liability Operations 
 Overview Property-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments: Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. 
 We do not allocate Property-Liability investment income, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes. 
 GAAP operating ratios are used to measure our profitability to enhance an investor s understanding of our financial results and are calculated as follows: 
 Loss ratio: the ratio of claims and claims expense (loss adjustment expenses), to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates. 
 Expense ratio: the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles and restructuring and related charges, less other revenue to premiums earned. 
 Combined ratio: the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. 
 We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between periods. The impacts are calculated by taking the specific items noted below divided by Property-Liability premiums earned: 
 Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio: includes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense 
 Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio 
 Effect of amortization of purchased intangibles on combined ratio 
 Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio 

Effect of Run-off Property-Liability business on combined ratio: includes claims and claims expense, restructuring and related charges and operating costs and expenses in the Run-off Property-Liability segment 
 Premium measures and statistics are used to analyze our premium trends and are calculated as follows: 
 PIF : policy counts are based on items rather than customers. A multi-car customer would generate multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were insured under one policy. Commercial lines PIF counts for shared economy agreements reflected contracts that covered multiple rather than individual drivers. Lender-placed policies are excluded from policy counts because relationships are with the lenders. 
 New issued applications : item counts of automobile or homeowner insurance applications for insurance policies that were issued during the period, regardless of whether the customer was previously insured by another Allstate brand. 
 Average premium - gross written average premium ): gross premiums written divided by issued item count. Gross premiums written include the impacts from discounts, surcharges and ceded reinsurance premiums and exclude the impacts from mid-term premium adjustments and premium refund accruals. Average premiums represent the appropriate policy term for each line. 
 Renewal ratio: renewal policy item counts issued during the period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the total policy item counts issued generally 6 months prior for auto or 12 months prior for homeowners. 
 Implemented rate changes: represents the impact in the locations (U.S. states, the District of Columbia or Canadian provinces) where rate changes were implemented during the period as a percentage of total brand prior year-end premiums written.

 Auto insurance premiums written increased 8.8 or 769 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and 11.0 or 2.79 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the following factors: 
 Increased average premiums driven by rate increases. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Rate increases of 9.1 were taken for Allstate brand in 49 locations, resulting in total estimated Allstate brand insurance premium impact of 6.3 
 Rate increases of 10.1 were taken for National General brand in 44 locations, resulting in total estimated National General brand insurance premium impact of 7.8 
 In 2024, we have removed underwriting restrictions in areas that represent the majority of Allstate brand countrywide premiums, which is expected to increase premiums written and PIF. In locations not 

achieving acceptable returns, we expect to continue to pursue targeted rate increases for both Allstate and National General brands. In states where we are achieving acceptable returns, we plan to take rates that keep pace with increasing costs. See Note 8 for additional details on actions taken related to Adirondack Insurance Exchange and New Jersey Skylands Insurance Association

 Policy growth is being reduced in states and lines of business that are underperforming. We are no longer writing new homeowners business in California, New Jersey and Florida, and are non-renewing certain policies in Florida. We may not be able to grow in certain states without regulatory or legislative reforms that enable customers to be provided coverage at appropriate risk adjusted returns.

 Organizational and process changes impacting claim opening and closing practices and shifts in timing, if any, can impact comparisons to prior periods 
 The quarterly auto loss ratio has been more variable due to these and additional factors discussed below. 
 Auto loss ratio decreased 9.5 and 10.4 points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023 driven by increased earned premiums and lower non-catastrophe losses. Estimated report year 2024 incurred claim severity for Allstate brand increased compared to report year 2023 for major coverages due to higher repair costs, a higher mix of total losses, an 

increase in claims with attorney representation, higher medical consumption, and inflation. Gross claim frequency decreased relative to the prior year. We continue to enhance our claims practices to manage loss costs by increasing resources and expanding re-inspections, accelerating resolution of bodily injury claims, and negotiating improved vendor services and parts agreements. 
 Homeowners loss ratio decreased 6.1 points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to increased premiums earned and lower non-catastrophe losses. Homeowners loss ratio decreased 25.9 points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to lower losses and increased premiums earned. 
 Gross claim frequency decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 due to fewer claims reported related to water and wind/hail perils. Paid claim severity decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to lower losses from water and wind/hail perils. Paid claim severity increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to inflationary loss cost pressure driven by increases in labor and materials costs. Homeowners paid claim severity can be impacted by both the mix of perils and the magnitude of specific losses paid during the quarter.

 Other personal lines loss ratio increased 17.6 and 3.1 points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to higher losses and unfavorable reserve development, partially offset by increased premiums earned. 
 Commercial lines loss ratio decreased 17.2 points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to lower non-catastrophe losses, partially offset by premiums earned decreasing as a result of the strategic decision for the Allstate brand to stop writing new business and non-renew certain policies. C ommercial lines loss ratio increased 16.9 points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to Allstate brand strategy changes and unfavorable reserve development related to the shared economy business, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses. 
 Other business lines loss ratio increased 23.1 and 7.6 points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher losses. 
 Catastrophe losses increased 522 million to 1.70 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to larger losses per event, primarily from hurricanes, including 630 million related to Hurricane Helene and 220 million related to Hurricane Beryl. Catastrophe losses decreased 1.01 billion to 4.55 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower losses per event for wind and hail events. 
 We define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of 1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events 

including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. 
 We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism, civil unrest, wildfires or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted. 
 Loss estimates are generally based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors. Our loss estimates are calculated in accordance with the coverage provided by our policies. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. Reserving for hurricane losses is complicated by the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period. In these situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe. 
 Over time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes by managing policies in force, utilizing reinsurance and participating in various state facilities.

 Catastrophe reinsurance The catastrophe reinsurance program is part of our catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide our shareholders with an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our personal lines business, reduce earnings variability, and provide protection to our customers. Our current catastrophe reinsurance program supports our risk and return framework which 

incorporates our robust economic capital model and is informed by catastrophe risk models including hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires and adjusts based on premium and insured value growth. As of September 30, 2024, the modeled 1-in-100 probable maximum loss for hurricane, wildfire and earthquake perils is approximately 2.9 billion, net of reinsurance. We continually review our aggregate risk appetite and

 the cost and availability of reinsurance to optimize the risk and return profile of this exposure. 
 The total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs, excluding reinstatement premiums, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 298 million and 880 million, respectively, compared to 268 million and 729 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Catastrophe placement premiums reduce net written and earned premium with approximately 80 of the reduction related to homeowners premium. 
 Prior year reserve reestimates Favorable reserve reestimates, including catastrophes, were 28 million 

in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to favorable reserve reestimates in personal auto lines and homeowners lines, partially offset by unfavorable reserve reestimates in other personal lines. Favorable reserve reestimates, including catastrophes, were 387 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to favorable reserve reestimates in homeowners and personal auto lines, partially offset by unfavorable reserve reestimates in other personal lines and commercial lines.

 Annual reserve review In the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, we performed our annual reserve review using established industry and actuarial best practices. The annual review resulted in unfavorable reserve reestimates totaling 58 million and 80 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reserve reestimates are included as part of claims and claims expense. 
 The reserve reestimates in 2024 primarily related to new reported information for asbestos related claims and adverse developments within the other run-off lines. 
 The reserve reestimates in 2023 primarily related to new reported information and defense costs for asbestos related claims and other run-off exposures 

and higher than expected environmental reported losses. 
 We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. However, as we progress with the resolution of disputed claims in the courts and arbitrations and with negotiations and settlements, our reported losses may be more variable.

 Portfolio composition by investment strategy We utilize two primary strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. As strategies and market conditions evolve, the asset allocation may change. 

Market-based strategy seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and provide flexibility to adjust investment risk profile based on enterprise objectives and market opportunities primarily through public and private fixed income investments and public equity securities. 
 Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk primarily through investments in private equity, including infrastructure investments, and real estate with a majority being limited partnerships. These investments include investee level expenses, reflecting asset level operating expenses on directly held real estate and other consolidated investments.

 Fixed income securities are rated by third-party credit rating agencies or are internally rated. The Securities Valuation Office SVO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC evaluates the fixed income securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories defined as NAIC designations . In general, securities with NAIC designations of 1 and 2 are considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. The rating is either received from the SVO based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations NRSRO provider list, including Moody s Investors Service Moody s ), S P Global Ratings S P ), Fitch Ratings Fitch ), or a comparable internal rating. 
 As a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the SVO filing process, the portfolio includes certain securities that have not yet been designated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date and the categorization of these securities is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis . 

As of September 30, 2024, 91.4 of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade. Credit ratings below these designations are considered lower credit quality or below investment grade, which includes high yield bonds. 
 Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Our initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the credit quality, sector, structure, and liquidity risks of each issuer. 
 Fixed income portfolio monitoring is a comprehensive process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds. For further detail on our fixed income portfolio monitoring process, see Note 5 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.

operating leverage. The preferred stock and subordinated debentures are viewed as having a common equity component by certain rating agencies and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined limit in our capital structure as determined by their respective methodologies. These respective methodologies consider the existence of certain terms and features in the instruments such as the noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock.

 Liquidity sources and uses We actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic and business conditions. Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the Company and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs. Additionally, we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility. 
 The Corporation is party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement Liquidity Agreement with certain subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to Allstate Insurance Company AIC ). The Liquidity Agreement allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. AIC serves as a lender and borrower, certain other subsidiaries 

Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 73 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

serve only as borrowers, and the Corporation serves only as a lender. The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is 1.00 billion. 
 In addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to, AIC. The amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation s subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation. The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to 1.00 billion. The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings. 
 Parent company capital capacity At the parent holding company level, we have deployable assets totaling 2.95 billion as of September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of cash and short-term, fixed income and equity securities that are generally saleable within one quarter. The earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 10.60 billion of cash, U.S. government and agencies fixed income securities, public equity securities, and short-term investments, which we would expect to be able to liquidate within one week. 
 Intercompany dividends were paid in the first nine months of 2024 between the following companies: American Heritage Life AHL ), Allstate Financial Insurance Holdings Corporation AFIHC ), the Corporation, North Light Specialty Insurance Company NLSIC and AIC. 
 Intercompany dividends in millions) AHL to AFIHC 130 AFIHC to the Corporation 130 NLSIC to AIC

 Based on the greater of 2023 statutory net income or 10 of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that AIC will be able to pay, without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval, at a given point in time through February 2025, is estimated at 1.20 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. In the first nine months of 2024, no dividends have been paid. 
 Dividends may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for. 
 The terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions. In the first nine months of 

2024, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures. 
 Additional resources to support liquidity are as follows: 
 The Corporation and AIC have access to a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements. The maturity date of this facility is November 2027. The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being 95 million. The commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional 500 million of borrowing, subject to the lenders commitment. This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5 debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. This ratio was 22.0 as of September 30, 2024. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2024. 
 To cover short-term cash needs, the Corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing capacity limited to any undrawn credit facility balance up to 750 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no balances outstanding for the credit facility or the commercial paper facility and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was 750 million. 
 The Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that was filed on April 30, 2024 and expires in 2027. We can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 635 million shares of treasury stock as of September 30, 2024), preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.
