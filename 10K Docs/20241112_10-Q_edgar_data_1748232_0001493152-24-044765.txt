material advertising costs were incurred for the three-month and six-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 

The
three hierarchy levels are defined as follows: 

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level
2 - Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level
3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit
risk adjustments are applied to reflect the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The
methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s
own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market. 

Financial
instruments consist primarily of cash, prepaid expense, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable. The carrying amounts
of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market
interest rates of these instruments. The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize
in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

and as of September 30, 2024 had an accumulated deficit of . The Company as of September 30,
2024 had negative working capital of . Additionally, the Company s activities since inception have been sustained through
debt and the long-term deferral of payments to vendors and others. 

The
Company intends to raise additional capital (beyond its public offering) through the sale of equity securities, an offering of debt securities,
or borrowings from financial institutions and possibly from related and nonrelated parties who may in fact lend to the Company on reasonable
terms. Management believes that its actions to secure additional funding will likely provide the Company the opportunity to continue
as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving any of these objectives. These sources of working
capital are not currently assured, and consequently do not sufficiently mitigate the risks and uncertainties disclosed above. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s ability to raise capital from the sale of
its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of operating revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

. 

For
the three-month and six-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we recognized and , and and in amortization expense,
respectively. We amortized these intangible assets over a period of twenty-four (24) months which was deemed their useful life. Intangible
assets were fully amortized as September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. 

Proto-Pod
Capitalized Costs and Internal Use Software 

The
Company defines a capital expenditure as a purchase or payment that provides a future benefit to the business and increases the value
of fixed asset or intangible asset and its value. The benefit to the business must exceed two years and the minimum capitalization threshold
varies. Capital is a limited company resource from which spending should result in increased value to the business, as generally demonstrated
by increased revenue, revenue protection, or increased efficiencies. Effective allocation of the Company s limited capital resources
needs to be performed to maximize benefit, and timely reporting and monitoring of capital spending is imperative. 

The
Company determined that certain expenditures paid to certain service providers should be capitalized for accounting purposes. Upon the
asset being placed in service the appropriate depreciation or amortization of the asset should begin. The Company determined through
detailed analysis and review with its service provider DLE Consulting DLE that costs incurred by the Company from DLE s
professional services and its intimate involvement in the development and construction, design and modifications to the Proto-Pod should
be capitalized. The Company has not determined as of this date that expenses for its new version of the Proto-Pod II should be capitalized.
The Company analyzes the expenditures on a monthly basis to expense or capitalize. The balance at March 31, 2024 for the Company s
Proto-Pod Capitalized Costs was . The Company during the three-month and six-month periods ended September 30, 2024 sold what remained
of its Proto-Pod Capitalized Costs to DLE, its vendor who had worked extensively on the Proto-Pod I project. The Company and DLE came
to an agreement to sell the Proto-Pod Capitalized Costs for which was satisfied with the commensurate reduction in accounts
payable to the vendor. 

The
Company determined through analysis and review with its related party service provider (see Note 4-Related Party Notes Payable and Other
Related Party Transactions) W270 Systems, SA W270 Systems that a portion of costs incurred by the Company from W270 Systems 
and its work on our internal use software to be utilized in the Proto-Pod development and its use by the Company to analyze information
obtained from various sources to expand on the Proto-Pod services. In the past W270 Systems devoted approximately 50 to 60 of its professional
time to our varied smart-phone applications that is to be offered by the Company in the near future, and 40 to 50 of its professional
time for our in-house use software that will not be made available to the public. Recently in the last three-month period it has been
determined that smart-phone application efforts and the capitalization of costs has significantly reduced in percentage of efforts. This
is two-fold as the Company believes it is near the end of the smart-phone application development and that commercial launch is imminent.
The vendor has validated this determination with its focus on pure software development and maintenance. The Company continues to analyze
these expenditures on a monthly basis to expense or capitalize. For the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024, the
Company capitalized internal use software costs of and . The balances at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 for Company s
Internal Use Software were and , respectively. 

and , and and for three-month and six-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company continues to employ its founder under an employment agreement which
started on March 31, 2017 and provides for a salary of per month for the first twelve (12) months, and on March 1 st ,
2018 increased to per month for the next twelve (12) months. . The Company
and the related party during the period ended September 30, 2024 agreed to cancel or forgive approximately of accrued compensation
to Mr. Dolan. This was necessary as the Company does not have the financial capabilities to pay Mr. Dolan for this compensation and it
was necessary for Mr. Dolan to forgive a portion of his compensation in order to receive concessions from several of its vendors that
had sizeable balances. It was agreed in principal by Mr. Dolan, the Company and the vendors that Mr. Dolan would forgive additional compensation
or convert that compensation into equity of the Company at the then prevailing prices. No written agreement was entered into with regards
to the remaining accrued compensation. Accrued compensation of and is due and payable as of September 30, 2024 and
March 31, 2024, respectively. 

On
December 31, 2017, the Company executed a promissory note with its related party, Mr. Robert Dolan, Chief Executive Officer of the Company
in the amount of . The unsecured note payable bears interest at per annum and is due upon demand. The outstanding balance for
the related party promissory note(s) due to Mr. Dolan as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was and respectively.
During prior years the Company borrowed money from a vendor who became a shareholder of the Company through its direct public offering.
This amount was negligible and amounted to owing to this shareholder. Prior to March 31, 2024 we paid this shareholder the amount
owed to them. Subsequent to March 31, 2024 and prior to September 30, 2024, the Company approached this vendor/shareholder (as well as
most recently Mr. Wesley Fry agreed to join our board of directors) to borrow much needed funds once again. This related party lent the
Company in August 2024 to cover certain obligations of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 total related party promissory notes
were which contains Mr. Dolan s related party note balance of and owed to Mr. Wesley Fry. Mr. Fry s
unsecured note payable bears interest at per annum and is due upon demand. Mr. Fry s total ownership is less than in the
Company s common stock. The Company used these related party funds for working capital purposes and for the development of its
proto-type GPods solution. The Company during the six-month period ended September 30, 2023 repaid of Mr. Dolan s related
party promissory note. The Company during the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 borrowed from Mr. Fry through a related
party promissory note. 

We
had accounts due and owing to a vendor that became a related party during the year ended March 31, 2019 due to their ownership in the
Company. The related party, was W270 Systems, SA, a Costa Rican corporation, and its principal, Mr. Fry, executed a subscription agreement
with the Company and its registered public offering and invested in the Company s common stock. Mr. Fry received shares
of common stock of the Company. As part of the accrued compensation forgiveness with Mr. Dolan described above, the Company was able
to secure vendor accounts payable forgiveness or reduction with W270 Systems, SA of . The related party accounts payable balance
for the vendor totaled at March 31, 2024 and at September 30, 2024. For the three-month and six-month period ended
September 30, 2024 related party accounts payable balances decreased by . 

Capitalized
Internal use Software increased during the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024 by .
As described in Note 3 above the Company in recent past capitalized approximately 50 (this has changed significantly within the
past three months) of the costs incurred to develop its internal use software in accordance with GAAP. Other costs incurred with
respect to this related party vendor are expensed as incurred; during the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024
this amounted to .
For the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024 we capitalized internal use software of 
and and expensed 
and in software development expenses, respectively. 

Capitalized
costs prototype increased during the three-month and six-month period ended September 30, 2024 by . As described in Note 3
above the Company capitalizes approximately 100 of the costs incurred to develop its prototype product in accordance with GAAP. Of the
 in costs capitalized, was incurred with respect to the DLE vendor a former related party, and 0 in costs that our CEO and President,
Mr. Dolan had incurred and paid for during the three-month and six-month periods. With the sale of the Proto-Pod Capitalized Costs during
the three-month and six-month periods, respectively, the Company does not believe that it will incur any capitalized costs with respect
to that prototype that is no longer under development, however the Company has begun or embarked on the development of a new prototype
that is classified as Proto-Pod II which is centered around recreational vehicle or delivery van sized enclosure that would support the
GPods product and services. 

The
two vendors, one a related party and the other a non-related party have agreed to defer all payments on their accounts payable balances
until the Company has secured sufficient financing.

Valuation

recovery of the deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods
in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. .

of accrued compensation to Mr. Dolan. This was necessary as the Company does not have the financial capabilities to pay Mr. Dolan
for this compensation and it was necessary for Mr. Dolan to forgive a portion of his compensation in order to receive concessions
from several of its vendors that had sizeable balances. As part of the accrued compensation forgiveness with Mr. Dolan described
above and in Note 4, the Company was able to secure vendor accounts payable forgiveness or a reduction with two of its non-related
party vendors totaling . 

It was agreed in principal by Mr.
Dolan, the Company and the vendors that Mr. Dolan in the near future would forgive additional accrued compensation or convert that
accrued compensation into equity of the Company at the then prevailing price for its common stock. No written agreement was entered
into with regards to the remaining accounts payable or future accounts payable for these vendors or with respect to Mr. Dolan s accrued compensation amounts.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections.
We may use words such as anticipate, expect, intend, plan, believe, 
 foresee, estimate and variations of these words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of
which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted.
These risks and uncertainties include the following: 

the
 risks and other factors described under the caption Risk Factors 

our
 future operating results; 

our
 business prospects; 

any
 contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the
 dependence of our future success on the general economy; 

any
 possible financings; and 

the
 adequacy of our cash resources and working capital. 

Because
the factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by us, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time,
and their emergence is impossible for us to predict. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent
to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. 

This
Report should be read completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.
The forward-looking statements included in this Report are made as of the date of this Report and should be evaluated with consideration
of any changes occurring after the date of this Report. We will not update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change
in the future and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events
or otherwise.

Operations 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 27, 2017, at which time we acquired a business plan, various pieces
of information technology, furniture and other office equipment, as well as industry resource materials and business relationships from
our founder and CEO, Mr. Dolan. As of November 12, 2024, we had three employees, Mr. Dolan and two other individuals. 

The
Company issued 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Dolan at inception in exchange for organizational services. Following our
formation, we issued an additional 4,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Dolan, in exchange for a business plan, office furniture,
design equipment, computing equipment along with other related industry materials that he developed. 

As
a commercial organic grower, Mr. Dolan was the third employee with Fortuna Organics in Fallbrook, California (located outside of San
Diego). Mr. Dolan experienced a significant amount of rudimentary development in indoor organic farming. The first GPod developed with
which Mr. Dolan participated in was to support growing in all season, the year-round ability to grow organic produce. This became a completely
new approach to organic growing. The green houses moved food production from the lower latitudes (as evidenced in the southern United
States), to higher latitudes. While green houses had inherent problems, different light cycle per season of the year, GPods allows the
grower to grow year-round. This empowers the grower to control Organic Requirements , a major concern in the organic growing
industry. Never before had the growing industry needed to consider demand for organic produce and its extreme popularity 

14 

Another
progressive development that Mr. Dolan was involved in was integrating new types of growing processes from drip irrigation and root immersion.
Mr. Dolan first visualized the idea of the GPod while working with Fortuna organics. Mr. Dolan professional experience has provided
him with keen insight into what the indoor grower needs to be successful. Through experimentation and multiple manufacturing trial and
errors, Mr. Dolan established the importance of simplicity and automation in the growing process. 

This
we believe is a vital aspect of what will be the GPods experience. Mr. Dolan will maximize his professional expertise in organic farming
industry providing a background for GPods product offerings to transform the green house. Mr. Dolan believes the GPod solution is a revolutionary
growing environment that will add benefits to the local community by creating alternative food sources to urban neighborhoods. 

We
are a development stage company and have no specific financial resources. We have not established or attempted to establish a source
of equity or debt financing. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report
emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern. We are in the early stages of executing our business plan. We still
have a significant amount of work that needs to be completed and funds that need to be raised in order to compete within this sophisticated
consumer market. To date, we have not developed any finished product or services and cannot predict when a finished product or services
will be developed or externally acquired. We believe that we have an advantage with our founder, and CEO and his industry relationships
and the solicitation of their help with growing our business model. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had limited assets which consisted of; cash and cash equivalents of 1,358, prepaid expense of 0, software
development costs of 108,600. In order to fund the development of our business and our working capital needs for the next 12 months,
we will attempt to secure funding from the sale of additional common stock (or preferred stock if necessary), from shareholder, related
party and non-related party loans, or from strategic joint ventures or partners. Furthermore, in order to implement the foregoing plan
of operations, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional financing of between 200,000 and 250,000. If we are unsuccessful
in securing the additional financing, we may not be able to proceed with execution of our business plan. 

Based
on the exact nature of our business and expected level of competition, we anticipate continuing to incur operating losses into the foreseeable
future. Because we currently do not have a fully developed and ready for market environmentally-friendly, cost-efficient optimized grow
system, and our resources are severely limited, we cannot predict if and when we will generate revenues or whether we will become a viable
and sustainable business operations. Accordingly, due to our lack of assets, significant operations and for the foreseeable future the
ability to generate revenues, our auditors have stated in their opinion that there currently exists substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

General
Overview 

There
is no way of accurately predicting when product development will progress to the point of generating any revenue. The timing of business
development is a function of having sufficient working capital. There is no way of knowing when or if we will be able to raise the necessary
funds. If we do, fully developed product offerings could be ready within three to six months following when the necessary funds have
been secured. If we do not raise sufficient financing, revenue producing activities of any kind will most likely not commence until at
least 18 months, if ever. 

We
are building a company that provides indoor self-contained organic growing modules. We are developing an interactive website that provides
customization using our extensive interchangeable modules. Our optimized growing system will enable the consumer to create custom a variety
of growing environments that meet the grower s specific needs. 

Our
intended optimized growing system focused website, ecommerce system and manufacturing facilities outline a three-step method for providing
users with what we believe to be a comprehensive approach to provide a turnkey growing environment. We believe this approach will provide
an experience in home gardening that will become the new way to empower the urban dwell with a sense of satisfaction from bountiful output
and will be valued by both the grower and their family and friends. We believe this acceptance in the urban city will provide rapid growth
and popularity. We will create a system that easy to use and promotes creativity. This approach will additionally help us in creating
long-lasting return customer relationships. 

Our
business operations will be comprised of two segments: a) an optimized growing system website for micro-farming consumers; and b) integration
services for the optimized grow system along with direct sales through retail outlets. The optimized growing system, website, ecommerce
solution and back-office framework were developed with the assistance of an established business website firm. The Company developed
its initial design of the growing system through the efforts of its founder and CEO, and the design firm with which the Company has been
working with for years on an as needed basis . 

15 

The
optimized growing system that the Company has developed through the direct assistance of a design and manufacturing facility (since early
2014) and the efforts of our founder, Mr. Dolan. The Company intends to seek the assistance of outside sales and marketing consultants
to develop a professional sales and marketing strategy to capitalize on our product designs. We will seek to staff a management team
(besides Mr. Dolan) with the technical skills necessary in hydroponic horticulture technology, design engineering with a strong emphasis
on simplicity and functionality. We intend to with further financing create and staff an in-house development group, which we believe
will develop new generations of the optimized growing system that GPods and services of a similar nature to our business development
in self-contained indoor organic gardening. 

While
the raw materials or components that we use are slightly more expensive, quality and consistency is assured. We believe that the current
materials and components that we use in our designs is worth the extra cost to us. The average user or customer we believe will seek
out a product that has this same quality and consistency and willing to pay more for it; part of our competitive advantage. We currently
source our raw materials and components from a number of suppliers. These raw materials or components are widely available and have no
geographic or international limitations on their availability. We do not believe that we will have any issues with obtaining these raw
materials or components from suppliers or the availability of raw materials or components needed for our optimized growing system. 

Our
plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our environmentally optimized
growing system business(s) or services (complimentary to the grow system) to meet our obligations on a timely basis. The Company has
not yet acquired or internally fully developed any services. We may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the
future because of a lack of available funds or financing to do so. In order for us to develop or acquire any services, we must be able
to secure the necessary financing, beyond just the proceeds of our completed public offering. In the early stages of our operations,
we will continue to keep costs to a minimum. The cost to continue to develop our business plan as currently outlined will be in excess
of 250,000. We have no established current sources of funds to buildout the business plan as outlined. Until we obtain sufficient and
further funding, we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder, and CEO providing substantially all of the work
on his own without any payment of cash compensation. This methodology would result in our development stage extending for at least two
to three years or even more. 

We
believe that our environmentally optimized growing system division (once developed, if at all) may generate revenues earlier than direct
sales (once developed, if at all). If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing, the Company faces the ultimate likelihood
of business failure. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the Company s
growth. 

Industry
Overview 

Urban
dwellers are challenged for the lack of growing space, many aspire to grow their own organic food but have no dirt or space to do so,
and many of these individuals have garages that could provide them with the space they would need to grow via the GPod. The GPod, or
closed growth system, is not a new idea, NASA for example has been developing similar modules since the 1950 s. Thus, taking advantage
of an underutilized garage space combined with the flexibility of the GPod growing system, we believe that we will empower urban dwellers
to grow their own food without having to move from the city. Daily ad-hoc shoppers are dependent on grocery stores, eventually discovering
farmer s markets, meeting people similar to themselves who were growing and selling or bartering their own produce. The GPod optimized
growing system can provide healthy food at a reasonable cost and availability, a healthy alternative. 

The
indoor growing trend first came about as a result of people moving to non-conducive growing latitudes, such as the upper mid-west. These
people of the north still needed fresh organic produce year-round, so they had to ship in produce half the year or create indoor growing
facilities (green-houses). They developed some of the most successful green houses in the world; these greenhouses controlled all the
necessary factors to grow plants such as; temperature, humidity, nutrient feeding and various other plant needs. The one factor they
could not control was light that would provide year-round growth. As a result of years of development, the indoor growing industry developed
high intensity lighting that plants need to flower and produce fruit. Urban residents with little or no space, often limited by Home
Owner Associations, are looking for ways to enjoy the art of organic growing, the GPods system enables the urban grower to grow within
the confines of his or her garage. GPods are an indoor, self-sustained, closed growing environment, they can grow year-round regardless
of the temperature or season. Some urban dwellers, who have the space to grow, sometimes lack the time and fortitude to embark on the
complex building of their own outdoor garden, GPods are a turnkey solution. The person who has the love for growing but lacks the time
to build or do the research necessary to build a successful self-contained growing environment can begin immediately via the GPod. 

Although
outdoor gardens facilitate the growing of vegetables and herbs they have inherent challenges, challenges that the GPod will greatly reduce.
The greatest challenge is the ability to grow year-round, GPods high intensity lighting allows for year-round growing. Secondly, the
GPod provides complete control of the growing environment, thus qualifying as a recognized Organic grow. Based on the growth
of the famers markets in the United States, we believe that the demographic of customers of the GPod growing environment to be at a scale
that will allow GPods to sell in high volume at a low price point. 

16 

Growing
organically the GPod way is the consumer s path to control over their intake, an attempt to make the foods you serve for your family
free of the things they don t need. It s argued that organic gardens are impractical, expensive and somewhat strange. Nothing
could be further from the truth. It is the way our great grandparents gardened, just inside a controlled environment, without the chemical
pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. 

Competitive
Focus 

We
expect to encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We intend to compete on the basis of technology, performance,
price, quality, reliability, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships,
user training, service and support, security, availability of applications and internet infrastructure offerings, and our sustainability
performance. 

The
market for our key business is characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large
number of new and rapidly growing businesses which we will compete with. In this market most product life cycles are short, and to remain
competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our products and services and compete effectively on the
basis of the above various factors. In addition, we may compete with our potential partners, including other grow-system businesses that
design, manufacture and market their products. Our successful management of these competitive relationships will be critical to our success.
Moreover, we anticipate that we may have to adjust our prices on our products and services to stay competitive in this market. 

We
believe the following will assist us in exploiting the expected growth in the environmentally optimized integrated portable grow system
market which is ideal for growing high quality specialty crops and many varieties of herbs and other plant life with controlled indoor
organic gardening: 

1. 
 Scalability .
 We believe our state of-the-art, environmentally optimized grow system and its varied support by unique GPod design and services
 will become scalable, a solution designed to serve the underserved, fragmented horticulture and micro-farming market and sophisticated
 urban gardener. 

2. 
 Sticky 
 Relationship . Our business model will provide a solution that is designed to act as an incentive to keep the consumer engaged
 with our state of-the-art, environmentally optimized grow system and support services using current and future GPod modules. 

3. 
 Expertise
 in Indoor Gardening . Our founder has extensive experience in organic growing which comes from his vast experience in the commercial
 growing industry. We will seek to capitalize on that expertise. 

4. 
 Speed
 to Implementation . We believe that a fully-developed environmentally optimized grow system and well thought-out vertical
 GPod product line, in combination with our manufacturing and distribution system, will provide immediate insight into the
 usage (and behavior) of our consumer and their micro-farming output and customers unique growing needs. 

Growth
Strategy 

Key
elements of our growth strategy shall include: 

1. 
 Core
 Products . We plan to enhance our core products through user interface and functionality with our optimized growing system as
 well as interchangeable modules for different growing requirements, with new offerings as soon as reasonably practicable. 

2. 
 Focus .
 We intend to organically grow market penetration by: (a) securing contracts with organic wholesalers in various markets, (b) exploiting
 social networks, (c) leveraging development opportunities, and (d) adding solutions to professionals in the market. 

3. 
 Strategic
 Alliances . We plan to team with other businesses that have complementary features to our products, when fully developed, thereby
 reducing our development cost and introducing us to consumers and end-users. 

4. 
 International
 Expansion . We intend to expand internationally through partnerships and alliances. 

17 

Business
Objectives 

Our
objective is to become a provider of self-contained organic grow modules. We are pursuing the following strategies to achieve this goal: 

a) 
 Initiating
 website development and ecommerce function, identifying complimentary product offerings, promoting, and advertising through social
 media campaigns; 

b) 
 Create
 a national media presence through social media We will seek to create and enhance a national awareness and aggressively market
 our products through social media outlets; 

c) 
 Identify
 and develop strategic relations with our Manufacturing partners utilize partners, high volume distribution facility to create
 highly efficient low-cost production model; and 

d) 
 High
 functioning, and esthetically pleasing grow modules will contribute to growers overall productivity and sense of well-being.
 GPods can convey a sense of self-reliance for the basic needs of life. We will provide a comprehensive selection of modules that
 can be food oriented or yield based to meet the expectations of each individual organic grower. Every Urban grower may not have the
 means to grow, but with the help of GPods they can grow year-round. 

GPod
products can transform any garage space into a productive space for the family to enjoy, not just the farmer. We believe that friends
visiting the garage fitted with a GPods products will instantly be won over. 

This
report includes limited market and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from internal research, publicly available information
and industry publications and surveys. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a
variety of factors, including those described in the section above entitled Risk Factors . 

It
is our plan to seek additional financing from either equity financing or through debt instruments. These efforts will most likely occur
now that our direct public offering is complete and the aggregate proceeds have been received. Our management has, through relationships
and partnerships, begun the necessary work on some of our intended products. Our founder and CEO has primarily provided these services
through the date of this report. Our business plan requires further completion of these tasks which require the hiring of employees and/or
outside contractors. With the level of sophistication and expertise of our founder and CEO, as well as other various professionals that
he knows, the Company should make progress in its development planned product, but currently no specific timeframe can be provided. Most
if not all of these actions will be predicated on the Company obtaining the necessary financing to accomplish these steps. If financing
is not available on terms reasonable to the Company and its shareholders, then the progression steps of this business plan will not occur
as planned and may never occur. 

We
currently have no sources of financing and no commitments for financing. There are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing
or the necessary resources to enter into contractual agreements with outside designers or sales/marketing firms. We currently do not
have any cash or other resources to commence the use of outside service providers. If we do not receive any funding or financing, our
business is likely to be maintained with limited operations for at least the next 12 months because our founder and CEO will continue
to provide his services without consideration. We have no formal agreement in place with our founder and CEO covering his services, our
founder s and CEO s plan will be to do all of the administrative and planning work as well as programming and marketing work
on his own without consideration while he continues to seek other sources of funding for the Company. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
currently have no patents or trademarks. We intend to file a United States federal trademark registration for GPODS, INC., 
 The GPod Solution, and various other marks. We currently have registered www.gpodsinc.com and www.gpods.biz 
domain names. We consider our trademarks and other intellectual property rights to be important to our branding strategy and business
success. Each state has its own laws regarding registration of a trademark, including the requirements for keeping the registration valid.
Although these laws are similar in many respects, variations exist regarding the time period for renewing the registration. For example,
a trademark registered in California is valid for only five years and is renewable for successive five-year periods. 

Although
not required to validate a trademark, federal registration does provide additional benefits for the trademark owner. Included in these
benefits are the right to use the symbol and the right to file a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court.
To maintain these benefits, the owner of a federally registered trademark must make additional periodic filings to keep the registration
valid. The first filing must be made between the fifth and sixth years after the trademark s registration date and is called a
 declaration of use or section 8 filing. This informs the USPTO that the trademark is still in use. The second
filing is made between the ninth and 10th years after the trademark s registration date and includes another declaration of use
along with an application for renewal. The third and subsequent filings will also include a declaration of use and application for renewal
and must be done between the ninth and 10th year anniversary after the last filing. We have not registered our trademark. 

Failing
to file the required renewal applications for a registered trademark will result in the registration being cancelled, but as long as
the trademark is still in use, the owner s common law trademark rights are still valid, and a new registration application can
be filed. Even common law trademark rights become invalid if the owner has abandoned use of the trademark. Non-use of a trademark for
three consecutive years is generally considered proof that the owner has abandoned the trademark. We have continued to use our trademark
and intend on re-registering and applying for all applicable protections available under the law along with the right to transfer.

Government
Regulation and Industry Standards 

While
there is no governmental regulation relating to the sale of growing equipment or soil and nutrients that we may sell in connection with
our GPod solution, there may be laws and regulations governing the cultivation and sale of certain horticulture products that may be
grown with the systems. We may be subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, compliance with which
will increase our operating costs, limit or restrict the product and services that we intent to provide or the methods by which we intend
to offer and how we sell those products and services. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various
forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position,
results of operations and future cash flows. 

Employees 

As
of November 12, 2024, the date of this Report, we had three employees, one of which is our founder and CEO, Mr. Dolan. During calendar
year ended December 31, 2024 (dependent on our financing and available working capital), Mr. Dolan will continue to devote at least 30
hours a week to us. Mr. Dolan is allowed to devote his time to our Company as he is not limited or restricted from being involved with
us by his other business operations. Mr. Dolan currently has no agreement with the Company which provides for cash payment of his services.
We may be limited in seeking the employment of others to assist in our operations. Our founder and CEO s current plan is to provide
all administrative and planning work for our product and marketing efforts on his own without any cash compensation while he seeks other
sources of funding for the Company and its business plan. We have a good relationship with our employees. 

The
Company s other two employees work on a part time basis and as needed for specific projects. Their function is to assist Mr. Dolan
with operations as well as administrative functions that are necessary to run the business. Mr. Dolan has been compensated through the
issuance of common stock in the Company and will continue to defer payment for his services for the near future. It is his belief that
these actions are in the best interest of the Company and prospective investors who may invest in the Company s common stock. We
may in the future use other independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as needed 
or per project basis pending adequate financial resources being available or their ability to defer payment for their services. 

Other 

As
a corporate policy, we will not incur any financial obligations that we cannot satisfy with identified resources. We believe the perception
that many have of a public company is that they are more likely than not that they will accept restricted securities from a public company
as consideration for indebtedness than they would from a private company. We have not performed any formal studies of this matter. Our
conclusion is based solely on our own observations. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts even
if we become a publicly traded company. The issuance of restricted shares will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders.

Expenses 

Expenses
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 47,250 and 52,601,
respectively. Expenses decreased comparative period over comparative period by 5,351 or a decrease of 10.2 . The primary reason for
this is we began our efforts on the Proto-Pod II version as well as increasing our business operations. Officer s compensation
- related party was 15,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15,000 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023. Officer compensation expense related party remained static comparative period over comparative period at
 5,000 per month. 

Consulting
expense were 8,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35,750 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. Consulting expenses decreased comparative period over comparative period by 27,750 or a decrease of 77.6 . The primary reason
for this is during the prior year we retained outside professionals to assist us with operational and other business type consulting
services, in preparation for our financial reporting and other regulatory needs that have been left unattended, along with process controls
and other best practices if we are to self-manufacture our GPod product. 

Legal
and accounting expenses were 2,750 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023. The Company retained PCAOB audit firm, Gillespie Associates, PLLC, in connection with the preparation of its
financial reporting and other regulatory needs that have been left unattended, Payments made were considered partial payments on the
missing periods March 31, 2020 through September 30, 2023. The Company expensed these payments in 2023 despite the work continued through
March, 2024. The Company expects to incur additional expenses due and owing to our PCAOB audit firm for our continued efforts in remaining
compliant. 

Software
development and consulting expense related party incurred in connection with our new environmentally optimized growing system
was 9,800 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,200 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.
Software development and consulting expense related party increased comparative period over comparative period by 8,600 or
an increase of 716.7 . The primary reason for this is we increased the need for outside contractors and development as well as efforts
in the development of our Proto-Pod II version of the former GPod product. 

Design
and technical expense incurred in connection with our new environmentally optimized growing system was 11,400 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Design and technical expense increased comparative
period over comparative period by 11,400. The primary reason for this is we increased the need for outside contractors and development
as well as efforts in the development of our Proto-Pod II version of the former GPod product. 

Administrative
costs and other expense were 300 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 651 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023. Administrative costs and other expense remained relatively static comparative period over comparative period. 

Other
income or expense were 371,800 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. This was comprised of debt forgiveness of 271,800 and gain on sale of asset (Proto-Pod I) of 100,000 for the three-months
ended September 30, 2024. These are one-time events and therefore not comparative for prior periods.

before provision for incomes taxes for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September
30, 2023 was 324,550 and (52,601), respectively. We recorded no provision for federal income taxes. We have not generated any revenues
to date besides the one-time sale of the fully reserved for Proto-Pod I asset. Provision for income taxes is specific to the California
minimum franchise tax due annually which is incurred in the first quarter of the year. Weighted average common shares outstanding was
16,270,500 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16,270,500 for the three-month period ended September 30,
2023. Basic and diluted gain/(loss) per share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023 was 0.02 and (0.00), respectively.

Expenses 

Expenses
for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 70,550 and 107,540,
respectively. Expenses decreased comparative period over comparative period by 36,990 or a decrease of 34.4 . The primary reason for this
is we began our efforts on the Proto-Pod II version as well as increasing our business operations. Officer s compensation - related
party was 30,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30,000 for the six-month period ended September 30,
2023. Officer compensation expense related party remained static comparative period over comparative period at 5,000 per month. 

Consulting
expense were 16,000 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 74,250 for the six-month period ended September 30,
2023. Consulting expenses decreased comparative period over comparative period by 58,250 or a decrease of 78.5 . The primary reason
for this is during the prior year we retained outside professionals to assist us with operational and other business type consulting
services, in preparation for our financial reporting and other regulatory needs that have been left unattended, along with process controls
and other best practices if we are to self-manufacture our GPod product. 

Legal
and accounting expenses were 2,750 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six-month period ended September
30, 2023. The Company retained PCAOB audit firm, Gillespie Associates, PLLC, in connection with the preparation of its financial
reporting and other regulatory needs that have been left unattended, Payments made were considered partial payments on the missing periods
March 31, 2020 through September 30, 2023. The Company expensed these payments in 2023 despite the work continued through March, 2024.
The Company expects to incur additional expenses due and owing to our PCAOB audit firm for our continued efforts in remaining compliant. 

Software
development and consulting expense related party incurred in connection with our new environmentally optimized growing system
was 9,800 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,400 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2023. Software
development and consulting expense related party increased comparative period over comparative period by 7,400 or an increase
of 308.3 . The primary reason for this is we increased the need for outside contractors and development as well as efforts in the development
of our Proto-Pod II version of the former GPod product. 

Design
and technical expense incurred in connection with our new environmentally optimized growing system was 11,400 for the six-month period
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2023. Design and technical expense increased comparative
period over comparative period by 11,400. The primary reason for this is we increased the need for outside contractors and development
as well as efforts in the development of our Proto-Pod II version of the former GPod product. 

Administrative
costs and other expense were 600 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 890 for the six-month period ended September
30, 2023. Administrative costs and other expense remained relatively static comparative period over comparative period. 

Other
income or expense were 371,800 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the six-month period ended September
30, 2023. This was comprised of debt forgiveness of 271,800 and gain on sale of asset (Proto-Pod I) of 100,000 for the six-months ended
September 30, 2024. These are one-time events and therefore not comparative for prior periods.

Liquidity 

Since
acquiring the business plan, most of our resources and work have been devoted to executing our business plan, limited technical design
and drawing, testing and mock-up of our interchangeable modules to be used with our intended product, implementing systems and controls,
and completing our registration statement for our direct public offering. With our registration statement complete, we began to focus
our work on product and service offerings as well as push forward with the development of our intellectual property surrounding our
new environmentally optimized growing system . We believe the research and development work needed to further complete our product
development, attract designers, and initiate marketing plans, including the development of a saleable product, will range between 200,000
and 250,000. This includes the use of several outside contractors and experts and the services of our founder, Mr. Dolan. If we are
able to secure the necessary funding to outsource these steps, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that we can execute a proper
launch of our product and services to the consumer. If we are only able to use internal resources (primarily consisting of services of
our founder, and CEO), the process may take much longer and our launch may be limited to a much smaller market. If we are unable to raise
sufficient financing, development costs would have to come from our founder and CEO (to the extent that he is capable and willing to
provide such additional financing). While we have engaged the services of several outside consultants on an as needed basis 
their assistance is rather limited and based on our financial capabilities and commitment. Our goal is for us to be able to have a saleable
product, several robust sales channels and an e-commerce presence in six to twelve months from the date of this Report. There is no way
of estimating the likelihood of reaching that goal. 

Private
capital will continue to be solicited from associates of our founder and CEO or through private investors referred to us by those same
associates. To date, we have not sought out any larger funding sources other than associates of Mr. Dolan, nor have we authorized any
person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf. If a market for our securities ever develops, of which there can be no assurances,
we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employees, consultants and independent contractors wherever possible.
We cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds needed to complete the development of our product and the stages
as outlined above. 

21 

We
embarked upon a journey to become a public company and, by doing so, have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses for
legal, accounting and related services. Once we become a publicly traded entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act, we will continue to incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses
including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate these costs to be in excess of 100,000 per year and may be higher
if our business volume or business activity increases significantly. Our current estimate of costs does not include the necessary expenses
associated with compliance, documentation and specific reporting requirements of Section 404 (as we are not subject to the full reporting
requirements of Section 404 until we exceed 75 million in market capitalization or we decide to opt-out of the emerging growth
company as defined under the JOBS Act). This exemption is only available to us under the JOBS Act or until we have been public
for more than five years. These obligations we believe reduce our ability and resources to expand our business. We hope to be able to
use our status as a public company to increase the ability to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate independent contractors
who provide professional services to us (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock), although there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in any of those efforts. We will reduce compensation paid to management (if and when we do compensate management)
if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs. 

We
do not have any current plans to raise capital through the sale of securities except as described herein. We hope to be able to use our
status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons or firms providing services
to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. We believe that the perception that many
people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration
for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is
based on our own beliefs and advice that we have received from finance and market professionals. Issuing shares of common stock to such
persons instead of paying cash to them may increase our chances to establish and expand our business and business opportunities. Having
shares of our common stock may also give a person a greater feeling of identity with us which may result in increased referrals. However,
these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common
stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management s ability to
maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.
GPODS, INC. may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred. No negotiations have taken place
with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares as settlement of obligations
due them. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we owed approximately 1,025,000 (of which 513,000 is owed to related parties) in connection with product development
costs incurred, consulting services and other expenses. We have not entered into any formal agreements or agreements, written or oral,
with any vendors or others for payment of services or expenses that cannot be deferred. There are no other significant liabilities due
as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we owed approximately 77,000 in connection with an interest-free demand loan from
two (2) related parties. As of September 30, 2024, we owed approximately 165,000 from three non-affiliated parties. The proceeds of
loans (both related party and non-related party) and our direct public offering were used primarily for working capital. Our cash position
was approximately 1,400 at period end September 30, 2024. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material
impact on results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 

An
accounting policy is considered to be critical: (a) if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters
that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made; and (b) if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes
in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. 

Financial
Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation
of financial statements. There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions about matters
that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Note 2 to the financial statements, included elsewhere in this interim report,
includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Seasonality 

We
have not generated any revenues, so we have no direct experience with seasonality for our business. We do not expect that our planned
business operations as currently outlined will be affected by seasonality.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
necessary under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e). The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the Company s desired disclosure control
objectives. In designing periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company s certifying officer, its
Principal Executive Officer, its Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, has concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching that level of assurance. 

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
Based on the evaluation, he concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. The Company hired a financial expert with the experience necessary
in creating and managing internal control systems as well as to continue to improve the effectiveness of our internal controls and financial
disclosure controls. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. The Company s management believes that a control system, no matter how
well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal
control system are met, and no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation
in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuers and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30,
2024 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Internal
control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined to
be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls
are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Part
II: Other Information 

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings 

We
know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding
or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder,
is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

Item 1a Risk Factors 

The
following risk factors should be considered in connection with an evaluation of our business as described above and in our Plan of Operations: 

In
addition to other information in this Report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because
such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the
risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, result
of operations, liquidity and financial condition. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition
could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, if and when a trading market for our securities is established,
the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

THE
SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE. THEY SHOULD
NOT BE PURCHASED BY PERSONS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE POSSIBILITY OF THE LOSS OF THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ
ALL OF THE COMPANY S FILINGS, INCLUDING ALL EXHIBITS, AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. 

You
should be aware that there are substantial risks to an investment in our common stock. Carefully consider these risk factors, along with
all of the other information included in this report, before you decide to invest in shares of our common stock. 

If
any of the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be
materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price for our common stock, if any, could decline, and prospective investors
would likely lose all or even part of their investment. 

Risks
Related to the Business 

1
 . 
 GPODS,
 INC. has virtually no financial resources. Our independent registered auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating
 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . 

GPODS,
INC. is an early-stage company and virtually no financial resources currently available to it. We had tangible assets of 109,958 and
 107,308 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We had a negative working capital balance of 1,009,370 and 1,681,820
as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We had a stockholders deficit of 900,770 and 1,576,220 at September
30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Our independent registered auditor included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our
financial statements as of and for the period ended March 31, 2024 that states that Company losses from operations raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. We will require additional financing beyond the amount received from the completed
public offering. Financing sought may be in the form of equity or debt from sources yet to be identified. With the completion of the
public offering, we will seek additional financing to further pursue and execute on our business operations and expansion. No assurances
can be given that we will generate revenue (or any at all) or obtain the necessary working capital to continue as a going concern. 

Our
current resources and source of working capital primarily consists of loans from several nonaffiliated parties who are business associates
of our founder. These nonaffiliated financial sources we believe to be sufficient to keep our business operations functioning for the
next six to 12 months. We do not have a formal agreement with our founder and CEO, nor with the nonaffiliated parties to fund our current
working capital needs; Mr. Dolan s, current plan is to perform most of the Company s operational needs on his own without
any cash compensation while he seeks additional sources of funding. This includes seeking to delay or defer payments to vendors and nonaffiliated
parties. Through the date of this report, deferred payment has helped us with managing our working capital needs. The Company developed
much of its initial design of its environmentally optimized growing system through the efforts of Mr. Dolan. We currently spend between
 10,000 and 15,000 per month on operational expenses not directly related to our completed public offering. Our monthly expenditures
are primarily related to consulting services that we incur for design and manufacturing and software development. Each of these firms
expend approximately 6,000 to 7,000 per month in billable hours for services provided. To date we have not generated any revenues from
our business, and our expenses will continue to accrue or be deferred until sufficient financing is obtained to be able to pay for these
expenses. Additional financing may be obtained from our founder or others who are familiar with our founder and loan us the funds necessary
to pay for these expenses. Through the date of this Report, we have received interest-free loans and deferred payment on services to
fund our operations. No assurances can be given that we will be able to continue fund our operations beyond a month-to-month basis. 

24 

2. 
 GPODS,
 INC. is and will continue to be completely dependent on the services of our founder, president, and CEO, Robert Dolan. The loss of
 whose services may cause our business operations to cease. We will need to retain qualified employees and outside consultants to
 further implement our business strategy. 

Our
operations and business strategy are completely dependent upon the knowledge and business relationships of Mr. Dolan, our founder and
CEO. He is under no obligation to remain employed by us. If he should choose to leave us for any reason, or if he becomes ill and is
unable to work, our operations will likely fail. If we are able to find sufficient personnel, it is uncertain whether we will find someone
to develop and execute our business along the lines described in this report and performed by our founder and CEO. We will certainly
fail without the services of Mr. Dolan or an appropriate replacement is found. 

We
intend to purchase key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Dolan naming the Company as the beneficiary when and if we obtain the financial
resources to do so and Mr. Dolan is insurable. We have not procured such insurance, and no guarantee is certain that we will be able
to obtain such key-man life insurance. Accordingly, it is important that we are able to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees
or outside contractors to further our business efforts and operations. 

3. 
 Because
 we recently commenced business operations, we face a high risk of business failure. 

We
were formed on March 27, 2017. Most of our efforts to date have been related to executing our business plan and expanding business operations.
Through September 30, 2024 we have had no revenues from our operations, besides the sale of our Proto-Pod Capitalized Costs for 100,000.
We face a high risk of business failure. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of our expenses, complications and delays
frequently encountered in connection with the establishment and expansion of a business and the competitive market in which the Company
operates. There can be no assurance that revenues from sales of our intended product or services will occur or that they will be significant
enough or we will be able to sell at a profit, if at all. Future revenues or profits, if any, will depend on numerous factors, including,
but not limited to, initial market acceptance and the successful implementation of a sound market strategy. 

The
Company has not yet fully developed product or services that are saleable and available to consumers. We may not be able develop any
product or services in the future because of a lack of funds or financing. In order for us to fully develop or acquire product or services,
we must secure financing beyond the recently completed direct public offering . In the early stage of our operations, we
have attempted to keep our costs at a minimum. The cost to develop product and services as currently outlined may well be in excess of
 250,000 which is beyond our current capital raise plans. We have no established source of funds to fully undertake our business and
expansion strategy as outlined. Until we obtain funding, if ever, we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder,
and CEO providing most of the administrative and other operational functions on his own without any cash compensation. We currently use
the services of a technical design firm with whom we have been working with on an as needed basis . The technical design
firm provides its services on a deferment basis enabling us to not have to pay them immediately or even in the near term. We do not expect
to pay them in full or even partially for a period of time. This methodology could result in our optimized environmental grow-system
development extending beyond another two to three years. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing, the Company faces
the likelihood of business failure. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing for our
growth. 

The
Company s future profitability, if any, could be materially and adversely impacted if our product or services were to experience
poor operating results. Our ability to achieve profitability will be dependent on the ability of our future product or services to generate
sufficient operating cash flow to fund future growth or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our future results of operations
will be profitable or that our strategy will be successful or even begin to generate any revenues. 

4. 
 We
 may not have or ever have the resources or ability to implement and manage our growth strategy. 

Although
the Company expects to experience growth based on the ability to implement and execute our business strategy, significant operations
may never occur because the business plan may never be fully implemented because of the lack of funds in order to do so. If the Company s
growth strategy is implemented, of which no assurances can be provided, a significant strain on our management, operating systems or
financial resources may be imposed. Failure by the Company s management to manage this expected growth, if it occurs, or if unexpected
difficulties are encountered during this growth, could impose a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations
or financial condition. 

The
Company s ability to operate a profitable product or service line (if we are able to establish any product or service line at all)
will depend upon a number of factors, including: (i) identifying an appropriate and satisfactory sales channel; (ii) generating sufficient
funds from our then-existing operations or by obtaining third-party financing or additional capital to develop new products or develop
new services; (iii) the success or the Company s management team along with our financial, accounting and internal control systems;
and (iv) staffing, training and retention of skilled personnel, if any at all. These factors are beyond the Company s control and
may be adversely affected by the economy or actions taken by competing businesses. Moreover, potential product or services that may meet
the Company s focus and other criteria for developing new product or services, if we are able to develop or acquire at all, are
believed to be limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to execute and manage a growth strategy effectively or
at all. 

25 

5. 
 We
 may not be successful in hiring technical personnel because of the competitive market for qualified people. 

The
Company s future success depends largely on its ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition
for such personnel may be intense. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting and retaining the specific
personnel it requires to conduct and expand its operations successfully or to differentiate us from our competitors. The Company s
results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected if the Company were unable to attract, hire, train
and retain such qualified personnel. 

6. 
 Our
 reliance on referrals from outside contacts to develop business may not be effective. 

The
Company initially will rely on our founder and CEO, Mr. Dolan, for a majority of our business and believes that industry professionals
will be an important source of business referrals. However, as is typical within the industry, there are no contractual agreements with
consultants or outside reps who may represent our product and services in the marketplace. We currently have no contracts or agreements
in place with outside sales reps or industry professionals. No assurances can be given that using outside sales reps or industry professionals
will result in any meaningful numbers of sales leads or referrals. 

7. 
 Fluctuations
 in our financial results make quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting difficult. 

The
Company s future or projected quarterly operating results may vary and reduced levels of earnings or continued losses may be experienced
in one or more quarters. Fluctuations in the Company s quarterly operating results could result from a variety of factors, including
changes in revenues, size and timing of orders, changes in the mix of projects, the timing of new offerings by the Company or its competitors,
new office or facilities openings by the Company, changes in pricing policies by the Company or its competitors, market acceptance of
new and enhanced services offered by the Company or its competitors, changes in operating expenses, availability of qualified personnel,
disruption in sources of related product and services, the effect of potential acquisitions and industry and general economic factors.
The Company will have limited or no control over many of these factors. The Company s expenses we believe will be based upon, in
part, on its expectation as to future or projected sales. If revenue levels are below expectations, operating results are likely to be
adversely affected by these revenue levels. Because of these fluctuations and uncertainties, our future operating results may fail to
meet the expectations of investors. If this happens, any trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. 

8. 
 There
 are significant potential conflicts of interest. 

Our
management and employees will be required to commit substantial time to our business affairs and, accordingly, these individuals (particularly
our founder and CEO) may have one or more conflicts of interest in allocating professional time among business activities. In the course
of other business activities, certain key personnel (particularly our founder and CEO) may become aware of business opportunities which
may be appropriate for presentation to us, as well as other businesses with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts
of interest in determining to which entity a business opportunity should be presented to. We cannot provide any assurance that our efforts
to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

9. 
 We
 will need to establish additional relationships with industry professionals to fully develop and market our company and its intended
 product or services. 

We
do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop our product or services on a commercial scale. We will need to design a network
of third-parties that will be able to carry out our intended market penetration, as well as enhance our marketing and sales strategy
through appropriate arrangements with local industry professionals and consultants to design new product and services. If we are not
able to enlist the services of third-party vendors, or seek out consultants, our business will suffer. 

10. 
 Following
 the effective date of our registration statement we are subject to periodic reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange
 Act. 

Following
the effective date of our registration statement we were required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Exchange Act. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm will review
our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will
review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted
at this time. The number and type of financial transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined
at this time and will affect the amount of time spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously
be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet overhead requirements and earn a profit. 

26 

However,
for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from
the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer
an emerging growth company. 

If
we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose
confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. 

11. 
 Our
 internal controls may be inadequate, which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive
and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
 authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. 

Failure
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to
lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

However,
our auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to
Section 404 until we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act if we take advantage of the exemptions
available to us through the JOBS Act. 

12. 
 The
 costs of being a public company could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
a public company, we are required to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements, including those pertaining to audits
and internal control. The costs of maintaining our public company reporting requirements could be significant and may preclude us from
seeking financing or equity investment on terms acceptable to us and our shareholders. We estimate these costs to be more than 100,000
per year and may well even be higher if our business volume or financial transactional activity increases significantly. Our current
estimate does not include necessary expenses associated with compliance, documentation and specific reporting requirements of Section
404 as we will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of Section 404 until we exceed 75 million in market capitalization
or we decide to opt-out of the emerging growth company as defined under the JOBS Act. This exemption is available to us
under the JOBS Act or until we have been public for more than five years. 

If
our revenues are insufficient or non-existent, and/or we cannot satisfy these costs through the issuance of shares or debt, we may be
unable to satisfy these costs during the normal course of business. This would certainly result in our being unable to continue as a
going concern. 

27 

13. 
 Having
 only two directors limit our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control
 of our founder, president, and CEO has over the Company. 

While
we have two directors, we have one director who serves as our sole officer and the other director is a vendor and a shareholder of the
Company. Accordingly, even with this other director, who is considered independent, we cannot establish board committees comprised of
independent members to oversee such functions as compensation or audit issues. 

Until
we have a larger board of directors that includes at least two independent members, if ever, there will be limited oversight of our CEO s
(and founder s) decisions and activities with diminished ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse such activities
and decisions, even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

14. 
 The
 Company sold shares without an underwriter. 

Shares
of common stock were offered on our behalf by Mr. Dolan, our founder and CEO, on a best-efforts basis. No broker-dealer was retained
and no broker-dealer was under any obligation to purchase any shares of common stock. The sale of a small number of shares increases
the likelihood that no market will ever develop for our common stock. 

15. 
 A
 limited number of investors purchased shares of our common stock; they may lose their entire investment without us being even able
 to develop a market for our shares. 

A
small number of shares were sold by the Company (7,500,000) to 61 investors, even with this number of individual investors we will be
unable to attempt to create a public market of any kind. In such an event, it is likely that the investors entire investment in
our common stock may be lost. Recently a number of investor s shares were reacquired by the Company through an arms-length transaction
at 0.01 per share. A total of 45 investors accepted the offer by the Company to acquire their 1,300,000 shares of common stock. The
Company will have paid for these shares through the remittance of funds to each shareholder as those funds are available. A shareholder
payable of 13,000 was recorded on the books as of September 30, 2020, that balance is currently 0 as of September 30, 2024. As of November
15, 2024 all 45 investors received payment from the Company. 

16. 
 The
 offering price of our common stock was determined arbitrarily. 

Our
offering price was not determined by an independent financial evaluation, market mechanism or by our auditors, and was, therefore, to
a large extent arbitrary. Our PCAOB-registered public accounting firms have not reviewed management s valuation and, accordingly
expresses no opinion as to the fairness of the price. As a result, the price of our direct public offering may ultimately not reflect
the value perceived by the market. There can be no assurance that the common stock issued is worth the price for which it was sold, and
investors may, therefore, lose a portion of, or their entire, investment. 

17. 
 Shareholders
 may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through issuance of additional shares. 

We
do not have a committed source of financing. Wherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to
satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock.
Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized (90,000,000)
shares but unissued (73,729,500) shares. In addition, if a trading market develops for our common stock, we may attempt to raise capital
by selling shares, possibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders,
further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. 

28 

18. 
 The
 aggregate proceeds of the direct public offering are not much more than the costs of the direct public offering, so the Company did
 not receive much of economic benefit from the completion of the direct public offering. 

The
maximum aggregate proceeds of the direct public offering 75,000) were slightly more than the costs to complete the direct public offering 35,000). We initially estimated the offering costs; actual costs could have significantly higher through delays and other conditions
that were out of our control. Despite the successful completion of the direct public offering and cost controls put in place we received
little financial benefit from the completion of the direct public offering. 

19. 
 The
 interests of shareholders may be hurt because we can issue shares to individuals or entities that support existing management with
 such issuances serving to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of our company. 

Our
board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued common
shares. Such issuances may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management and the interests of existing
management which may not be the same as the interests of other shareholders. Our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval
serves to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of the company. 

20. 
 Our
 articles of incorporation provide for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation at Article XI provide for indemnification as follows: No director or officer of the corporation shall
be personally liable to the corporation or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer;
provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer: (i) for acts or
omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law; or (ii) the payment of dividends in violation of Section
78.300 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Any repeal or modification of an Article by the stockholders of the corporation shall be prospective
only and shall not adversely affect any limitation of the personal liability of a director or officer of the corporation for acts or
omissions prior to such repeal or modification . 

We
have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal
securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director,
officer or controlling person in connection with our activities, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled
by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to
this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors
is likely to materially reduce market and price for our shares, if such a market ever develops. 

21. 
 Currently,
 there is no established public market for our securities, and there can be no assurances that any established public market will
 ever develop or that our common stock will be quoted for trading and, even if quoted, it is likely to be subject to significant price
 fluctuations. 

Prior
to the date of this report, there has not been any established trading market for our common stock, and there is currently no established
public market whatsoever for our securities. While we have not contacted a market maker, we will need to contact a market maker to file
an application with FINRA on our behalf. This application is done in order to be able to quote the shares of common stock on the OTCBB
maintained by FINRA commencing only upon the effectiveness of our registration statement. Market maker selection will be made now that
our direct public offering is completed. There can be no assurance that a market maker s application when filed will be accepted
by FINRA, and we cannot accurately estimate as to the period of time that the application will require. We are not permitted to file
such application on our behalf, this can only be done by a market maker who is a member of FINRA. 

If
this application is accepted by FINRA, there can be no assurances as to whether: 

(i) 
 any
 market for our shares will develop; 

(ii) 
 the
 prices at which our common stock will trade; or 

(iii) 
 the
 extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. Active trading markets
 generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors. 

29 

If
we are able to have our shares of common stock quoted on the OTCBB, we will then try, through a market maker and it s clearing
firm, to become eligible with the Depository Trust Company DTC in order to permit our shares to trade electronically.
Generally, if an issuer is not DTC-eligible, its shares cannot be electronically transferred between brokerage accounts,
which, based on the current realities of the marketplace, means that shares of an issuer will not be traded. Technically the shares of
an issuer may be traded manually between accounts, but this takes days, sometimes weeks, and is not a realistic option for issuers. While
DTC-eligibility is not a requirement to trade on the OTCBB, it is a necessity to process trades if an issuers securities are going
to trade with any volume. There are no assurances that our shares of common stock will ever become DTC-eligible or, if they do how long
it will take to accomplish. 

In
addition, our common stock is unlikely to be followed by financial analysts, and few institutions acting as market makers will act in
such capacity for our common stock. These factors could adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of the shares of our common
stock. Until the shares of our common stock are fully distributed, and an orderly market develops, if ever, the price at which it trades
is likely to fluctuate. Prices for the shares of our common stock will be determined by the marketplace and may be influenced by many
factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock, developments affecting our business, including
factors referred to elsewhere, investor perception of the Company and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can be provided
that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock. 

Because
of the anticipated low price of the securities being registered, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in these
securities. Purchasers of our securities should be aware that any market that develops will be subject to the penny stock regulations
and restrictions. 

22. 
 Any
 market that develops will be subject to the penny stock regulations and restrictions pertaining to low priced stocks. 

The
trading of our securities, if any, will be in the over-the-counter market which is commonly referred to as the OTCBB as maintained by
FINRA or the other over-the counter markets such as OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC-Pink Current Information trading platforms as maintained by OTCMarkets
Group, Inc. (the OTC Market ). As a result, investors will find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations
as to the price of, our securities. 

Rule
3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security
that has a minimum bid price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to a limited
number of exceptions which are not available to us. It is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks for the immediately
foreseeable future. This classification severely and adversely affects any market liquidity for our common stock. 

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting
forth the identity and= quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s account for transactions in
penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make
a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge
and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 

The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth: 

the
 basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and 

that
 the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions 
payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies
available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Additionally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent
price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures or may encounter
difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders
to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These
additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if and when our securities become publicly
traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our
shares, in all probability, will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our shareholders will, in all likelihood,
find it difficult to sell their securities. 

30 

23. 
 The
 market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses that could adversely impact investors in our stock. 

Company
management believes that the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: 

Control
 of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

Manipulation
 of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

Boiler
 room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by sales persons; 

Excessive
 and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 

Wholesale
 dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with
 the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. 

24. 
 Any
 trading market that may develop may be restricted by virtue of state securities Blue Sky laws that prohibit trading
 absent compliance with individual state laws. 

Currently
there is no established public market for the shares of our common stock, and there can be no assurance that any established public market
will develop in the foreseeable future. Transfer of shares of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities or securities
regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as Blue Sky laws. Absent
compliance with such individual state laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities registered
hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue-sky laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire
to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future, should be aware that there may be significant state blue sky
law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. These restrictions
prohibit the secondary trading of our common stock. We currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale
in at least 11 states which do not offer manual exemptions (or may offer manual exemptions but may not offer one to us if we are considered
by them to be a shell company at the time of application) and require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders.
Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one. 

25. 
 Our
 board of directors (consisting of one person, our founder and CEO) has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred
 stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power
 and perpetuate their control over us. 

Our
articles of incorporation allow us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board
of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock. Our board of directors
has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, including large blocks of preferred stock. As a result,
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to
our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and
the right to redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the shares of our common stock. 

26. 
 The
 ability of our founder and CEO to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders ability to influence corporate
 affairs. 

As
of the date of this report our founder and CEO beneficially owns 62 percent of our equity. Because of his beneficial ownership, our founder,
and CEO is in the unique position to elect the board of directors, decide on all matters requiring shareholder approval and determine
our policies. The interests of our founder and CEO may differ from the interests of other shareholders, such as with respect to the issuance
of new shares, business transactions with or a sale to other companies, selection of additional officers and directors and other significant
business decisions. Minority shareholders would have no way of overriding decisions made by our founder and CEO. This level of control
may have an adverse impact on the market value of the shares of our common stock because our founder and CEO may institute or undertake
transactions, policies or programs that may result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community
or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share. 

27. 
 A
 significant portion of our presently issued and outstanding common shares are restricted under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, as
 amended. 

A
significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock (10,000,000 of the 16,270,500 shares) are restricted securities 
as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or
an exemption from registration, if available. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who is not an affiliate and has held restricted
securities for a prescribed period of at least six (6) months if purchased from a reporting issuer or twelve (12) months (as is the case
herein) if purchased from a non-reporting Company, may, under certain conditions, sell all or any of his shares without volume limitation,
in brokerage transactions. Affiliates, however, may not sell shares in excess of one percent of the Company s outstanding common
stock every three months. As a result of the revisions to Rule 144 (effective December 31, 2008) there is no limit on the number of restricted
securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate (i.e., a stockholder who has not been an officer, director or control person for at least
90 consecutive days) after the restricted securities have been held by the owner for the aforementioned prescribed period of time. A
sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available, or pursuant to registration of shares of common stock of
present stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop. 

31 

All
10,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of the restricted securities are owned by our founder, and CEO, which consists of 6,000,000
and 4,000,000 shares issued for services and tangible and intangible assets which may be sold commencing one year from the date our direct
public offering was completed. 

28. 
 We
 do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We
have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable
future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other
factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your
investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. 

29. 
 We
 are an emerging growth company and cannot be certain whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
 growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including,
but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will
rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market
for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an
 emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will
comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging
growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with
new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

30. 
 Because
 we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures, our stockholders have
 limited protection against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. 

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York and
American Stock Exchanges and the NASDAQ Stock Market, as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating
to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and
apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the NASDAQ Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with
many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with
such compliance any sooner than legally required, we have not yet adopted these measures even though we may be required in the future. 

We
do not have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result, our directors have the ability, among other things, to determine
their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required,
the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against self-interested director
transactions, conflicts of interest, if any, and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to
expand our operations. 

We
intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required. However, we may find
it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide
for our effective management as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted
in a series of rules and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors
and executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it costlier or deter qualified
individuals from accepting these roles. Some of the corporate governance measures have been metered by the JOBS Act. 

32 

31. 
 You
 may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the Securities
 and Exchange Commission could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances. 

As
of the effective date of our registration statement we became subject to certain informational requirements of the Exchange Act, as amended
and are required to file periodic reports (i.e., annual, quarterly and material events) with the Securities and Exchange Commission which
will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying. In the event during the year that our registration statement
became effective, these reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we have less
than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8-A (of which we have no current plans to file). If this occurs
after the year in which our registration statement became effective, we will no longer be obligated to file such periodic reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and access to our business information would then be even more restricted. After this we may be
required to deliver periodic reports to security holders as proscribed by the Exchange Act, as amended. However, we will not be required
to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report
their beneficial ownership of securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Previously,
a company with more than 500 shareholders of record and 10 million in assets had to register under the Exchange Act. However, the JOBS
Act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from 500 to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not accredited investors 
(or 2,000 persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies). The JOBS Act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to
employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold. This means that access to information regarding
our business and operations will be limited. 

For
all of the foregoing reasons and others set forth herein, an investment in our securities and any market that may develop in our securities
in the future involves a high degree of risk and potential loss of your entire investment.
