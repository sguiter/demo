million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , net cash used in operating activities was million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was million. The Company s primary use of cash is to fund
operations as NextNav continues to grow. The Company expects to incur
additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future,
specifically as NextNav invests in ongoing research and development and its PNT networks. 
 
 Ma naging liquidity and the Company s cash position is a
priority of the Company. The Company continually works to optimize its expenses
in light of the growth of its business and adapt to changes in the economic
environment. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 
will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs,
including all contractual commitments, beyond the next 12 
months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company believes it will meet longer term expected future cash
requirements and obligations through a combination of its existing cash and
cash equivalents balances and marketable securities, cash flows from
operations, and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, this
determination is based upon internal financial projections and is subject to
changes in market and business conditions.

million and million, respectively. The Company estimates losses on accounts receivable based on expected losses, including its historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , all accounts receivable balances were current and allowances for doubtful accounts were recorded. 
 
 Contract liabilities relate to amounts billed in advance, or advance consideration received from customers, for which transfer of control of the good or service occurs at a later point in time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company s contract liabilities were thousand and thousand, respectively, and are recorded in deferred revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company s leases may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The option to renew may be automatic, at the option of NextNav or mutually agreed to between the landlord and NextNav. Lease terms include the non-cancellable term and periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. 
 
 The Company s lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under the lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for utilities and maintenance. The Company combines fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and accounts for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of the Company s lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments for common area maintenance. 
 
 Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company s incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in the Company s leases is not readily determinable. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Lease assets are reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from Other current assets upon lease commencement. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Monthly rent expense includes any site related utility payments or other fees such as administrative or up-front fees contained in the lease agreements that are determinable upon execution of the lease agreement.

million in shares of NextNav common stock within days of the assignment of the M-LMS Licenses at Closing following the FCC Approval. 

The Company
subsequently received the Alameda Court Approval on March 28, 2024 and made the cash payment of million in April 2024. The Company has recognized the cash consideration of million within other current assets
in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September
30, 2024 . Further, the Company recorded a current liability and
prepaid asset of million as of March 31, 2024 with respect to the fair value of shares
expected to be issued (based on a 20 -day 
volume weighted average price) equivalent to the 
million First Noncash Consideration, as the payment obligation is upon passage
of time and is not contingent. During the three and nine
months ended September 30,
2024 , the Company reduced the First Noncash Consideration liability by million and 
million, respectively, and recorded the gain in other income (expenses) in the
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. The reduction was due
to the fair value adjustment of shares expected to be issued, based on a 20 -day volume-weighted average price,
equivalent to the million First Noncash
Consideration. The fair value of the shares expected to be issued was
determined based on non-observable pricing inputs in the market and is
categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company accrues a loss contingency liability related to
the nonrefundable prepayments if it is probable that the Transaction will be
terminated or cancelled. As of September 30, 2024 , management expects the Transaction to successfully complete, and loss contingency liability was recorded. 

The Asset Purchase Agreement provides for contingent consideration in the amount of million, payable in shares of NextNav common stock. Payment is contingent upon the FCC granting additional flexibility in the use of M-LMS spectrum.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses, amounts included in other current assets, and current liabilities that meet the definition of a financial instrument, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
 
 Assets, liabilities, and equity instruments that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include fixed assets and intangible assets. The Company recognizes these items at fair value when they are considered to be impaired or upon initial recognition. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are determined with valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow models. 
 
 Level 3 Liabilities 
 
 The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist with the fair value analysis of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below). The analysis used commonly accepted valuation methodologies and best practices to determine the fair value of the equity, in accordance with fair value standards and U.S. GAAP. For the Private Placement Warrants that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , NextNav used a Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table shows the assumptions used in each respective model:

 Overview 
 
 We are
the market leader in delivering resilient, next generation positioning,
navigation and timing PNT solutions designed to complement and back up
existing Global Positioning System GPS and Global Navigation Satellite
Systems GNSS by addressing the limitations and vulnerabilities inherent in
space-based systems. Our complementary PNT solutions are built on a deep asset
base, which we are evolving to utilize 5G New
Radio 5G NR technologies. We expect
NextGen, the evolution of our technology platform to 5G
NR, to significantly improve the efficiency and flexibility of our operations,
technically enabling the delivery of high-quality PNT based on a 5G broadband deployment. Since the inception of
NextNav, LLC in 2007, we have secured valuable
Federal Communications Commission FCC licenses for a contiguous 8 MHz band of Lower 900MHz
spectrum covering over 90 of the U.S.
population, subject to appropriate regulatory approvals have signed an
agreement to acquire licenses for an additional 4MHz
of Lower 900MHz spectrum, and standardized our
TerraPoiNT technology in 3GPP, the global
telecommunications standards-setting body. As of September 30, 2024, we held
approximately 161 patents related to our systems and services. 
 
 O n April 16, 2024, we
petitioned the FCC to commence a rule making to update the Lower 900MHz band
plan to allow us to utilize a 15MHz nationwide configuration for both PNT and
5G broadband (the Petition ). We believe that modernizing the Lower
900MHz Band will simultaneously enable a high-performing terrestrial PNT
network to complement and back up GPS, a critical national security imperative,
and add 5G mobile broadband capacity, a substantial public interest
benefit. As part of the ongoing FCC regulatory process, on August 6,
2024, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking public comments concerning the Petition.
 Our NextGen technology is designed to allow one or more partners to
integrate our Lower 900MHz spectrum into their 5G networks, while we implement,
operate and manage additional PNT-optimized infrastructure over the 5G network. 
 
 We currently deliver differentiated PNT solutions through our network-based Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT solutions. Our Pinnacle service provides accurate altitude to any device with a barometric pressure sensor, including most off-the-shelf smartphones. We launched our Pinnacle network in partnership with AT T Services, Inc. AT T for FirstNet , the nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network, and our network covers over 90 of commercial structures over three stories in the U.S. In addition to public safety applications and FirstNet , our network is being used for enhanced 911 E 911 by Verizon Communications, Inc. Verizon ), and a growing set of devices operating on the remaining national cellular network providers. Our Pinnacle network is also an important component of our PNT resiliency services, and is being evaluated as a persistent PNT characterization platform. 
 
 Our TerraPoiNT system is a terrestrially-based network designed to address the limitations and vulnerabilities inherent in space-based PNT systems, and our NextGen technology, through the adoption of 5 G NR, will simultaneously support both PNT and 5 G broadband capabilities. Space-based PNT systems transmit a faint, unencrypted signal, which is often unavailable indoors, distorted in urban areas, and vulnerable to both jamming and spoofing. TerraPoiNT and its NextGen evolution overcome these limitations through the terrestrial transmission of a PNT signal on licensed Lower 900 MHz spectrum. Unlike space-based signals, the TerraPoiNT and NextGen signals can be reliably received indoors and in urban areas, are difficult to jam or spoof, and can support robust authentication. TerraPoiNT and NextGen signals can embed Pinnacle information to provide a full 3 D PNT solution, and can be configured to provide National Institute of Standards and Technology timing distribution services. Because our NextGen technology will be built on 5 G NR, we expect significantly increased geographic coverage, more rapid network availability and expanded device availability for PNT services when combined with one or more 5 G broadband partners networks. We believe that these capabilities are an essential complement and backup in the event of GPS disruptions, and are a critical need due to the economy s reliance on GPS for location and precision timing. GPS resiliency is increasingly a U.S. national security priority, and is rising in priority in the European Union, non-European Union countries in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world due to both the demonstrated vulnerability and lack of local control of space-based signals and systems, highlighted by recent events in Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere. Critical infrastructure, including communications networks and power grids, require a reliable GPS signal for accurate timing. A failure of GPS could be catastrophic, and there is no comprehensive, terrestrial backup that is widely deployed today. 

19 

Simultaneously, demand for wireless data services continues to grow. The backbone of wireless data services, electromagnetic spectrum, is a finite resource. Our spectrum licenses in the Lower 900 MHz band are referred to as low-band spectrum . There is a finite amount of low-band spectrum available, and it has favorable coverage characteristics compared to higher frequencies, including the ability to provide services indoors and at greater distances. These characteristics result in its ability to be used for coverage and to be deployed more economically, with higher-frequency spectrum often used to provide additional capacity in targeted locations. Our transition to 5 G NR as the basis for our PNT services will provide a technical capability for simultaneous broadband data in our band, in addition to our PNT services, and, subject to appropriate regulatory approvals, may allow us to utilize our spectrum to help meet the continued, growing demand for wireless data capacity while making more efficient use of our Lower 900 MHz spectrum licenses. 
 As of September 2024, TerraPoiNT is deployed and available, with metro-wide service in the San Francisco Bay Area and select services availab l e in over 90 mark e ts national ly. In addition, NextNav supports a system deployed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA for drone operations research and is contracted to provide service at its Ames facility in Mountain View, CA, leveraging our network in the Bay Area.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have incurred losses since our inception and to date have generated only limited revenue. We have primarily relied upon debt and equity financings to fund our cash requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we incurred net losses of 69.6 million and 55.3 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was 26.1 million and 17.7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , our net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was 24.6 million and 1.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of 86.8 million and an accumulated deficit of 829.8 million. We expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future. Our primary use of cash is to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. We will require a significant amount of cash for expenditures as we invest in ongoing research and development and our PNT networks. 
 
 M anaging liquidity and our cash position is a priority of ours. We continually work to optimize our expenses in light of the growth of our business, and adapt to changes in the economic environment. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, beyond the next 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe we will meet longer term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents balances and marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, this determination is based upon internal financial projections and is subject to changes in market and business conditions. 
 
 In 2023 , we issued 70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 10 to the lenders thereto. Such notes will mature on December 1, 2026 with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. We may elect, at our sole discretion, to pay up to 50 of the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior secured notes due with our common stock. Refer to Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
