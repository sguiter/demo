SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, contemplate, continue, could, design, due, estimate, expect, goal, intend, may, objective, plan, positioned, potential, predict, seek, should, target, will, would and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report, including without limitation statements regarding our business model and strategic plans for our products, technologies and business, including our implementation thereof, the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations from macroeconomic conditions, the timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, our commercialization efforts, our acquisitions, including resulting synergies and future milestone payouts, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy, our expectations about the commercial success and market acceptance of our products, the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the plans and objectives of management for future operations and capital expenditures are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described under the sections in this Quarterly Report entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. We intend the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. As discussed in the "Explanatory Note", amounts throughout this discussion and analysis for our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been restated to reflect the impact of the restatement as described in the Amended 2024 Quarterly Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the Company's expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources, that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements . The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Overview We are a leading medical device company exclusively focused on the foot and ankle orthopedic market and are dedicated to improving patient lives. Our innovative orthopedic solutions, procedural approaches and instrumentation cover a wide range of foot and ankle ailments including fracture fixation, forefoot, ankle, flatfoot or progressive collapsing foot deformity, charcot foot and orthobiologics. To treat these painful, debilitating or even life-threatening conditions, we provide a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that includes surgical implants and disposables, as well as surgical instrumentation. We design each of our products with both the patient and surgeon in mind, with the goal of improving outcomes, reducing ailment recurrence and complication rates, and making the procedures simpler, consistent and reproducible. We believe our passion, expertise, and exclusive focus in the foot and ankle market has allowed us to better understand the needs of our patients and physicians, which has enabled us to create innovations and enhanced solutions that disrupt and transform the foot and ankle market. As a result, we have experienced significant growth and momentum in our business. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our sales increased as a result of increased surgical volume driven primarily by U.S sales force expansion, growth in focused international markets and key product launches in the ankle, forefoot and fracture fixation segments. As a result, we reported net revenue growth of 18 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Our gross profit margin was 74.1 and 75.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 77.4 and 78.3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing decreases from the corresponding prior year periods driven primarily by higher non-cash charges for excess and obsolete inventory, partially offset by lower freight expense, as a percent of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was positive 0.4 million and negative 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue and a change in the fair value of financial instruments, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was negative 10.3 million and negative 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Their Limitations In addition to our results and measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating and comparing our financial and operational performance over multiple periods, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions.

Table of Contents 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation to net loss, helps identify underlying trends in our business and helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, tax rates, or different forms of employee compensation. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to a key financial metric used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these potential limitations include: other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may report Adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures; although depreciation and amortization expenses are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditures for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt that we may incur. 
 Free Cash Flow is an additional key performance measure that our management uses to assess our financial performance and liquidity. Additionally, management believes Free Cash Flow is helpful to assessing our operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our capital expenditures, and that monitoring Free Cash Flow can help us manage financial risk. In addition, management believes Free Cash Flow provides meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP measures only as supplemental to other GAAP-based financial measures. For reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to their most comparable GAAP financial measure, see GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations .

 GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, employee stock purchase plan expense, non-recurring expenses and certain other non-cash expenses. For a full reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, refer to the presentation below.

 (1) Represents the non-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swap contract and earnout liability for all periods presented. (2) Represents severance costs incurred pursuant to an ongoing operational efficiency strategy. Free Cash Flow We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, refer to the presentation below. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (2,665) (14,114) (23,869) (47,517) Purchases of property and equipment (3,628) (6,539) (13,119) (21,893) Free cash flow (6,293) (20,653) (36,988) (69,410) Components of Our Results of Operations Net Revenue We derive our revenue from the sale of our foot and ankle orthopedic solutions, primarily implants. We also record as revenue any amounts billed to customers for shipping costs and record as cost of goods sold the actual shipping costs. We have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes, such as sales, use, value-added, assessed by government authorities and collected from a customer. Therefore, revenue is recognized net of such taxes. In addition, we record revenue net of estimated discounts and other price concessions. No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We expect our net revenue to increase in the foreseeable future as we expand our sales territories, add new customers and increase the utilization of our products by our existing customers, though net revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including availability of reimbursement, the size and success of our sales force, the number of hospitals and physicians who are aware of and use our products and seasonality. 

 18 

Table of Contents 
 Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Cost of goods sold consists primarily of finished products purchased from third-party suppliers, shipping costs, excess and obsolete inventory adjustments and royalties. Implants are manufactured to our specifications primarily by third-party suppliers in the United States. Cost of goods sold is recognized at the time the implant is used in surgery and the related revenue is recognized. Prior to use in surgery, the cost of our implants is recorded as inventories, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Cost of goods sold is expected to increase due primarily to increased sales volume. We calculate gross profit as net revenue less cost of goods sold, and gross margin as gross profit divided by net revenue. We expect our gross profit to increase in the foreseeable future as our net revenue grows, though our gross profit and gross margin have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily average selling prices, third-party manufacturing costs, change in mix of customers, excess and obsolete inventory adjustments, royalties and seasonality of our business. Our gross margin is higher for products we sell in the United States versus internationally due to higher average selling prices. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate from period to period, however, based upon the factors described above and seasonality. Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses is comprised of engineering costs and research programs related to new product and sustaining product development activities, clinical studies and trial expenses, quality and regulatory expenses, and salaries and benefits related to research and development functions. We maintain a procedurally focused approach to product development and have projects underway to add new systems across multiple foot and ankle indications and to add additional functionality to our existing systems. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel to develop new product offerings and product enhancements. Selling, General, and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to U.S. sales representatives, salaries, bonuses, and benefits related to selling, marketing, and general and administrative functions, and stock-based compensation. In addition, selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of the costs associated with marketing initiatives, physician and sales force medical education programs, surgical instrument depreciation, travel expenses, professional service fees (including legal, finance, audit and tax fees), insurance costs, facility expenses and other general corporate expenses. We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business. We also expect our administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, to increase as we increase our headcount and expand our facilities and business processes to support our operations as a public company. Our selling, general and administrative expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality of our business and as we continue to add direct sales territory managers in new territories. Other Income (Expense) Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of changes in fair value related to contingent earn out liabilities and our interest rate swap contract. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net consists of interest incurred, amortization of financing costs and interest income earned during the reported periods.

U.S. net revenue was 51.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing growth of 15 compared to the prior year. U.S. net revenue growth was the result of increased surgical volume driven primarily by sales force expansion and new product launches in our ankle, forefoot and fracture fixation segments. International revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 11.2 million, representing growth of 36 compared to the prior year. International revenue growth was driven primarily by the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Margin. Cost of goods sold increased 4.2 million, or 36 , from 11.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 16.2 million during the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to an increase in net revenue, region mix and non-cash increases in inventory write-offs and excess and obsolete inventory. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 74.1 , compared to 77.4 in the same period of 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher non-cash charges for excess and obsolete inventory, partially offset by lower freight expense as a percentage of revenue.

Other Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased 1.0 million, from income of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to expense of 0.6 million for corresponding period in 2024. The change from other income to expense is primarily related to the changes in fair value of the Company s contingent earnout liabilities and interest rate swap contract. Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net increased 1.9 million, from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.0 million for the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt and higher interest rates on our outstanding debt.

Interest expense, net increased 5.4 million, from 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 8.6 million for the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt and higher interest rates on our outstanding debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of capital from inception through September 30, 2024, have been from ongoing operations, proceeds from public and private securities offerings and the incurrence of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 39.1 million and the principal amount of our outstanding consolidated debt aggregated to 110.6 million, of which 0.6 million is classified as current in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we had available borrowing capacity of 50.0 million, comprised of 25.0 million on our Ares Term Loan and 25.0 million on our Ares Revolving Loan. 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 We believe that our existing cash, additional available borrowing capacity and expected revenues will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our primary short-term needs for capital for our planned operations, which are subject to change, include: expanding our research and development initiatives to improve our existing products and develop new products and solutions; and continued commercialization efforts and expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure and programs to drive anticipated sales growth in the United States and elsewhere. 
 We have based our short-term capital needs and planned operating requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Although not anticipated at this time, we may require additional financing to fund our operations and planned growth. We may also seek additional financing opportunistically. We may seek to raise any additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we could be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional capital through collaborations agreements, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product or grant licenses that may not be favorable to us. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities received any distribution of our corporate assets. In addition, market conditions impacting financial institutions could impact our ability to access some or all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we may be unable to obtain alternative funding when and as needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Cash Flows The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:

Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company revised the inputs used in estimating the reserve on obsolete and slow-moving inventory to include forecasted sales, in addition to current inventory levels and historical sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies or in the methodology used for estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Amended 2023 Annual Report, other than the item described above. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted and their potential impact to our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuating interest rates. The Company has both fixed and variable rate debt to manage the impact of these fluctuations. The Company is the fixed rate payor on an interest rate swap

 contract to help manage some of this risk. Based on our overall interest rate exposure as of September 30, 2024, we do not believe a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness would have a material effect on our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk Our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars. Any transactions that may be conducted in foreign currencies are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows may become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have identified certain material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting which were also disclosed in our Amended 2023 Annual Report. As a result of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Plan for Remediation of the Material Weaknesses Management, with oversight by the Audit Committee of the board of directors, is devoting significant time, attention, and resources to remediate the material weaknesses and to strengthen its monitoring, control environment, and internal control over financial reporting. We have developed a remediation plan that includes: Evaluating and updating (as appropriate) the organizational design and reporting structure of the controllership function, including evaluating the sufficiency, experience, and training of personnel within our accounting function. Hiring, developing, and retaining accounting resources with appropriate accounting and internal controls expertise related to accounting for inventory in accordance with GAAP. Engaging third-party resources with the appropriate technical knowledge and experience to assist with the accounting for inventory and designing and implementing related control activities. Designing and implementing additional and/or enhancing controls relating to the valuation of inventory, including the calculation of the excess and obsolescence reserve and capitalization of purchase price variances. Designing and implementing effective monitoring activities over the execution of business performance reviews and account analysis and enhance communication of internal control deficiencies to those parties responsible for taking corrective action in a timely manner. We plan to continue to devote significant time and attention to remediate these material weaknesses as soon as reasonably practicable. Management believes that the measures described above and others that may be implemented will

 remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management has begun to take these actions to remediate the material weaknesses and may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in the appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures identified. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediation plan has been implemented and there has been appropriate time to conclude through testing that the controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than as described above in connection with our material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We may in the ordinary course of business face various claims brought by third parties and we may, from time to time, make claims or take legal actions to assert our rights, including intellectual property rights as well as claims relating to employment matters and the safety or efficacy of our products. Any of these claims could cause us to incur substantial costs and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage, may be inadequately capitalized to pay on valid claims, or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any associated costs, damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business. We were not involved in any legal proceedings as of September 30, 2024, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Class Action Litigation On September 30, 2024, and October 18, 2024, respectively, two putative class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. These complaints allege that the Company and certain current and former officers violated federal securities laws. The cases are captioned Ellington v. Paragon 28, Inc., et al., and Tiedt v. Paragon 28, Inc., et al. We believe the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. Given the early stage of the litigation matters described above, we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate possible losses or form a judgment that an unfavorable outcome is either probable or remote. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved, and on our business generally. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, lawsuits and legal proceedings are costly, divert management attention, and may adversely affect our reputation, even if they are resolved in our favor. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Amended 2023 Annual Report. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable
