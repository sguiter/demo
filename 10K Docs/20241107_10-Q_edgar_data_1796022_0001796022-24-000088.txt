 of the membership interests in the General Partner of the Partnership. SSG acts as the sole managing member of the General Partner of the Partnership and, as a result, indirectly operates and controls all of the Partnership s business and affairs. As a result, SSG consolidates the financial results of the Partnership and reports non-controlling interests related to the Class B, Class C and Class D units of the Partnership which are not owned by SSG. The assets and liabilities of the Partnership represent substantially all of SSG s consolidated assets and liabilities, with the exception of certain deferred income taxes and payables due to affiliates pursuant to tax receivable agreements (see note 10). Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to vote and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to votes. As of September 30, 2024, SSG held approximately of the economic interest in the Partnership. As the Partnership s limited partners exchange their Class B, Class C and Class D units into SSG s Class A common stock in the future, SSG s economic interest in the Partnership will increase relative to that of the Class B, Class C and Class D unitholders.

 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where noted) earned in respect of certain accounts, including certain permanent capital vehicles, for which the Company is the investment adviser, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or performance benchmarks. Incentive fees are a form of variable consideration and represent contractual fee arrangements in the Company s contracts with its customers. Incentive fees are typically subject to reversal until the end of a defined performance period, as these fees are affected by changes in the fair value of the assets under management or advisement over such performance period. Moreover, incentive fees that are received prior to the end of the defined performance period are typically subject to clawback, net of tax. 
 The Company recognizes incentive fee revenue only when these amounts are realized and no longer subject to significant risk of reversal, which is typically at the end of a defined performance period and/or upon expiration of the associated clawback period (i.e., crystallization). However, clawback terms for incentive fees received prior to crystallization only require the return of amounts on a net of tax basis. Accordingly, the tax-related portion of incentive fees received in advance of crystallization is not subject to clawback and is therefore recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. Incentive fees received in advance of crystallization that remain subject to clawback are recorded as deferred incentive fee revenue and included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Carried interest allocations include the allocation of performance-based fees, commonly referred to as carried interest, to the Company from unaffiliated limited partners in the StepStone Funds in which the Company holds an equity interest. The Company is entitled to a carried interest allocation (typically to based on cumulative fund or account performance to date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. These carried interest allocations are subject to the achievement of minimum return levels (typically to in accordance with the terms set forth in each respective fund s governing documents. The Company accounts for its investment balances in the StepStone Funds, including carried interest allocations, under the equity method of accounting because it is presumed to have significant influence as the general partner or managing member. Accordingly, carried interest allocations are not deemed to be within the scope of ASC 606. 
 Legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations reflect the allocation of carried interest to legacy Greenspring general partner entities from limited partners in certain legacy Greenspring funds in which the legacy Greenspring general partner entities hold an equity interest. The legacy Greenspring general partner entities are entitled to a carried interest allocation (typically to based on cumulative fund or account performance to date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. The Company accounts for the investment balances in the legacy Greenspring funds, including carried interest allocations, under the equity method of accounting because it is presumed to have significant influence as the general partner or managing member . Accordingly, legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations are not deemed to be within the scope of ASC 606. The Company does not hold any direct economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities and thus is not entitled to any carried interest allocation from the legacy funds. All of the carried interest allocations in respect of the legacy Greenspring funds are payable to employees who are considered affiliates of the Company and are therefore reflected as legacy Greenspring performance fee-related compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of income.

 Indemnification Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business and consistent with standard business practices, the Company has provided general indemnifications to its limited partners, officers and directors when they act in good faith in the performance of their duties for the Company. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined as these indemnities relate to future claims that may be made against the Company or related parties, but which have not yet occurred.

 Business Overview 
 We are a global private markets investment firm focused on providing customized investment solutions and advisory and data services to our clients. Our clients include some of the world s largest public and private defined benefit and defined contribution pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, as well as prominent endowments, foundations, family offices and private wealth clients, which include high-net-worth and mass affluent individuals. We partner with our clients to develop and build private markets portfolios designed to meet their specific objectives across the private equity, infrastructure, private debt and real estate asset classes. These portfolios utilize several types of synergistic investment strategies with third-party fund managers, including commitments to funds primaries ), acquiring stakes in existing funds on the secondary market secondaries and investing directly into companies co-investments ). As of September 30, 2024, we were responsible for approximately 682 billion of total capital, including 176 billion of AUM and 506 billion of AUA. 
 We are a global firm and believe that our multi-asset class expertise, local knowledge, business relationships, proprietary data and technology, and presence are all critical to securing a competitive edge in the private markets. We deploy a local staffing model, operating from 26 cities across 16 countries on five continents. Our offices are staffed by investment professionals who bring valuable regional insights and language proficiency to enhance existing client relationships and build new client relationships. Since our inception in 2007, we have invested and continue to invest heavily in our platforms to drive growth and expand our investment solutions capabilities and service offerings, including through opportunistic transactions that have helped accelerate the growth of our team and capabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1,050 total employees, including approximately 360 investment professionals and approximately 690 employees across our operating team and implementation teams dedicated to sourcing, executing, analyzing and monitoring private markets opportunities. 
 We have a flexible business model whereby many of our clients engage us for solutions across multiple asset classes and investment strategies. Our solutions are typically offered in the following commercial structures: 
 Separately managed accounts SMAs . Owned by one client and managed according to their specific preferences, SMAs integrate a combination of primaries, secondaries and co-investments across one or more asset classes. SMAs are meant to address clients specific portfolio objectives with respect to return, risk tolerance, diversification and liquidity. SMAs, including directly managed assets, comprised 107 billion of our AUM as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Focused commingled funds. Owned by multiple clients, our focused commingled funds deploy capital in specific asset classes with defined investment strategies. Focused commingled funds comprised 54 billion of our AUM as of September 30, 2024 . 
 47 

Advisory and data services. These services include one or more of the following for our clients: (i) recurring support of portfolio construction and design; (ii) discrete or project-based due diligence, advice and investment recommendations; (iii) detailed review of existing private markets investments, including portfolio-level repositioning recommendations where appropriate; (iv) consulting on investment pacing, policies, strategic plans, and asset allocation to investment boards and committees; and (v) licensed access to our proprietary data and technology platforms, including StepStone Private Markets Intelligence SPI Research and our other proprietary tools. Advisory relationships comprised 506 billion of our AUA and 15 billion of our AUM as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Portfolio analytics and reporting. We provide clients with tailored reporting packages, including customized performance benchmarks as well as associated compliance, administrative and tax capabilities. Mandates for portfolio analytics and reporting services typically include licensed access to our proprietary performance monitoring software, SPI Reporting. SPI Reporting tracked detailed information on over 730 billion of client commitments as of September 30, 2024 , inclusive of our total capital responsibility, previously exited investments and investments of former clients. 
 We generate revenues from management and advisory fees and performance fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with the StepStone Funds and our clients. We also invest our own capital in the StepStone Funds we manage to align our interests with those of our clients. Through these investments, we earn a pro-rata share of the results of such funds and may also be entitled to an allocation of performance-based fees from the limited partners in the StepStone Funds, commonly referred to as carried interest. 
 
 Trends Affecting Our Business 
 Our business is affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the financial markets, regulatory environment, and economic and political conditions. Changes in global economic conditions and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions can materially affect the values of the StepStone Funds holdings, our ability to source attractive investments and completely utilize the capital that we have raised, and result in increased compliance costs and administrative burdens. However, we believe our disciplined investment philosophy across our diversified investment strategies has historically contributed to the stability of our performance throughout market cycles. Furthermore, we operate at scale across all four private markets asset classes and service clients across a broad range of geography, type, and size, which contributes to our operating resilience and mitigates against concentration risk. 
 In addition to these macroeconomic trends and market factors, we believe our future performance will be influenced by the following factors: 
 The extent to which clients favor private markets investments. Our ability to attract new capital is partially dependent on clients views of private markets relative to traditional asset classes. We believe our fundraising efforts will continue to be subject to certain fundamental asset management trends, including (1) the increasing importance and market share of private markets investment strategies to clients of all types as clients focus on lower-correlated and absolute levels of return, (2) the increasing demand for private markets investments from private wealth clients, (3) shifting asset allocation policies of institutional clients and (4) increasing barriers to entry and growth for potential competitors. 
 Our ability to generate strong, stable returns. Our ability to raise and retain capital is partially dependent on the investment returns we are able to generate for our clients and drives growth in our fee-earning AUM FEAUM and management fees. Although our FEAUM and management fees have grown significantly since our inception, adverse market conditions or an outflow of capital in the private markets management industry in general could affect our future growth rate. In addition, market dislocations, contractions or volatility could put pressure on our returns in the future which could in turn affect our fundraising abilities. 
 48 

Our ability to maintain our data advantage relative to competitors. Our proprietary data and technology platforms, analytical tools and deep industry knowledge allow us to provide our clients with customized investment solutions, including asset management services and tailored reporting packages, such as customized performance benchmarks as well as compliance, administration and tax capabilities. Our ability to maintain our data advantage is dependent on a number of factors, including our continued access to a broad set of private market information and our ability to grow our relationships with fund managers and clients of all types. 
 Our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. The continued growth in our revenues is dependent on our ability to identify attractive investments and deploy the capital that we have raised. However, the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from period to period due to the availability of attractive opportunities and the long-term nature of our investment strategies. Our ability to identify attractive investments is dependent on a number of factors, including the general macroeconomic environment, valuation, transaction size, and the liquidity of an investment opportunity. A significant decrease in the quality or quantity of potential opportunities could significantly and adversely affect our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Increased competition and clients desire to work with fewer managers. There has been an increasing desire on the part of larger institutional investors to build deeper relationships with fewer private markets managers. At times, this has led to certain funds being oversubscribed due to the increasing flow of capital. Our ability to invest and maintain our relationships with high-performing fund managers across private markets asset classes is critical to our clients success and our ability to maintain our competitive position and grow our revenue. 
 
 Current Events 
 In 2024, signs of easing inflation coupled with the expansion of economic activity at a sustained pace and low unemployment rates contributed to positive returns in most financial markets despite inflation remaining elevated. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.50 to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 in response to positive trends in economic data, including a measure of inflation. 
 We are continuing to closely monitor developments related to inflation, decreasing but still higher interest rates, potential regulatory and governmental policy developments as a result of U.S. elections , banking system volatility, geopolitical tension, unrest or conflicts, including in Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East , and assess the impact on financial markets and on our business. Our results and the overall industry results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by slowdowns in fundraising activity and the pace of capital deployment, which have resulted in, and may continue to result in, delayed or decreased management fees. Further, fund managers have been unable or less able to exit existing investments profitably. Such conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, delayed or decreased performance fee revenues. I t is currently not possible to predict the ultimate effects of these events on the financial markets, overall economy and our condensed consolidated financial statements. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry Difficult or volatile market and political conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage, causing our clients to reduce their investments in private markets, reducing the number of high-quality investment managers with whom we may invest, and reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital and Risk Factors Banking system volatility may adversely affect the results and financial condition of the StepStone Funds or StepStone generally included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

Corporate Transactions 
 Purchase of Asset Class Non-Controlling Interests 
 On February 7, 2024, we entered into agreements (the Transaction Agreements with each of SRA, SRE and SPD (the Asset Class Entities ), their respective asset class heads as seller representatives, the seller parties signatory thereto, and certain other parties. The Transaction Agreements provide a path to the Partnership owning all of the outstanding equity interests of the Asset Class Entities over a defined period of time. 
 The Transaction Agreements provide for, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the exchange of the sellers equity interests in the Asset Class Entities, as applicable, for a combination of (i) newly-created Class D equity interests Class D units in the Partnership with terms substantially similar to the Partnership s existing Class C units, in the case of SRA and SRE, or shares of Class A common stock, in the case of SPD, and (ii) cash (at our discretion for all exchanges except the initial exchange), in up to ten annual exchanges (or up to fifteen annual exchanges in certain circumstances in the case of the sellers of SRA equity interests). 
 On May 31, 2024, we completed the first annual exchange (the 2024 Exchange to acquire approximately 5 of the equity interests of each of SRA, SRE and SPD pursuant to the Transaction Agreements dated as of February 7, 2024. As a result of the 2024 Exchange, the Partnership now owns approximately 54 of the outstanding equity interests of SRA, 56 of the outstanding equity interests of SRE and 54 of the outstanding equity interests of SPD. The aggregate consideration paid by us in the 2024 Exchange was approximately (i) 13 million in cash, (ii) 513,394 shares of Class A common stock and (iii) 2,239,185 Class D units of the Partnership. 
 In connection with the transactions contemplated by the SRA Transaction Agreement and SRE Transaction Agreement, we entered into a Class D Exchange Agreement (the Class D Exchange Agreement at the closing of the 2024 Exchange on May 31, 2024. The Class D Exchange Agreement provides, among other things, sellers under the SRA Transaction Agreement and SRE Transaction Agreement with the ability, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, to exchange the Class D units issued to them in connection with the SRA Transaction Agreement and SRE Transaction Agreement on a one-for-one basis with shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.001. In addition, the Class D Exchange Agreement restricts the exchange of the Class D units issued to such sellers, which restriction applies for a maximum of one year (or two years if a Transaction Agreement Exchange (as defined in the Class D Exchange Agreement) constitutes an Acceleration Exchange (as defined in the Class D Exchange Agreement)), subject to certain exceptions. 
 Equity Transactions 
 In June 2024, we issued 1,731,807 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 1,731,807 Class B units of the Partnership in accordance with elective exchange notices submitted pursuant to an agreement with the Class B limited partners (the Class B Exchange Agreement to allow for exchange of Class B units of the Partnership to shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain restrictions. A corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and a corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. On the same date, we also issued 71,766 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 71,766 Class C units of the Partnership in accordance with the elective exchange notices submitted pursuant to an agreement with the Class C limited partners (the Class C Exchange Agreement to allow for exchange of Class C units of the Partnership to shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain restrictions. A corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. 
 50 

In September 2024, we conducted an underwritten public offering of 4,099,997 shares of Class A common stock (the September 2024 Offering at a public offering price of 50.00 per share. We used all of the net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, to purchase (i) 300,000 shares of our Class A common stock from certain selling stockholders, (ii) 3,094,981 Class B units of the Partnership from certain holders thereof, including certain of our directors and executive officers, and (iii) 705,016 Class C units of the Partnership from certain holders thereof. 3,094,981 shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and 3,799,997 Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. 
 Also in September 2024, we issued 312,112 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 312,112 Class B units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class B Exchange Agreement. A corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and a corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. On the same date, we also issued 34,027 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 34,027 Class C units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class C Exchange Agreement. A corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. 
 Debt Transactions 
 On October 22, 2024, we issued 175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.52 Series A senior notes due October 22, 2029 (the Notes ), pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as of October 22, 2024 (the Note Purchase Agreement ), by the Partnership and accepted and agreed to by the purchasers party thereto in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from the issue and sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes, including to make investments, repay existing debt and make distributions. 
 Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 22 and October 22 of each year, commencing on April 22, 2025. Interest on the Notes will accrue from and including October 22, 2024. The Notes will mature on October 22, 2029. We may, at our option, prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 5 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus any applicable make-whole amount and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, provided that, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, no make-whole amount shall be due if the Notes are paid on or after April 22, 2029. 
 
 Organizational Structure 
 SSG is a holding company and its only business is to act as the managing member of the General Partner, and its only material assets are Class A units in the Partnership and 100 of the interests in the General Partner. In its capacity as the sole managing member of the General Partner, SSG indirectly operates and controls all of the Partnership s business and affairs. Therefore, we consolidate the financial results of the Partnership and report non-controlling interests NCI related to the Class B units, Class C units and Class D units held by partners of the Partnership in our consolidated financial statements. 
 51 

Pursuant to the StepStone Limited Partnership Agreement, the Class B Exchange Agreement, the Class C Exchange Agreement and the Class D Exchange Agreement that SSG and the Partnership entered into with partners holding Class B units, Class C units and Class D units of the Partnership, respectively, each Class B unit, Class C unit or Class D unit is exchangeable for one share of SSG s Class A common stock or, at SSG s election, for cash, subject to certain restrictions specified in the relevant exchange agreement. When a Class B unit, Class C unit or Class D unit is surrendered for exchange, it will not be available for reissuance. When a Class B unit is exchanged for a share of SSG s Class A common stock, a corresponding share of SSG s Class B common stock will automatically be redeemed by SSG at par value and canceled. There are no corresponding shares of common stock for the Class C and Class D units. 
 The diagram below illustrates our organizational structure as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Amounts may not sum to 100 due to rounding. 
 (1) The partners of the Partnership other than StepStone Group Inc. are: 
 the General Partner, which holds a 100 general partner interest and no economic interests; 
 certain members of management, employee owners and outside investors, all of whom own Class B units and an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock; 
 certain employee owners who own Class C units; and 
 certain employee owners who own Class D units. 
 (2) Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote and vote together with the Class B common stock as a single class, except as set forth in SSG s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or as required by law. 
 (3) Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to five votes prior to a Sunset (as defined below). After a Sunset becomes effective, each share of our Class B common stock will then entitle its holder to one vote. The economic rights of our Class B common stock are limited to the right to be redeemed at par value. 
 52 

A Sunset is triggered upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) Monte Brem, Scott Hart, Jason Ment, Jose Fernandez, Johnny Randel, Michael McCabe, Mark Maruszewski, Thomas Keck, Thomas Bradley, David Jeffrey and Darren Friedman (including their respective family trusts and any other permitted transferees, the Sunset Holders collectively cease to maintain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 10 of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (determined assuming all outstanding Class B units have been exchanged for Class A common stock); (ii) the Sunset Holders cease collectively to maintain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of an aggregate of at least 25 of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, before giving effect to a Sunset; and (iii) September 18, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 the Sunset Holders collectively maintained direct or indirect beneficial ownership of approximately 28.4 of the Class A common stock (determined assuming all outstanding Class B units have been exchanged for Class A common stock) and approximately 56.5 of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. 
 
 Key Financial Measures 
 Our key financial measures are discussed below. Additional information regarding our significant accounting policies can be found in note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily from management and advisory fees, incentive fees and allocations of carried interest. 
 Management and Advisory Fees, Net 
 Management and advisory fees, net, consist of fees received from managing SMAs and focused commingled funds, advisory and data services, and portfolio analytics and reporting. Management fees include income-based incentive fees, which are predictable and recurring in nature and paid quarterly based on net investment income of certain funds . 
 Management fees from SMAs are generally based on a contractual rate applied to committed capital or net invested capital. These fees will vary over the life of the contract due to changes in the fee basis or contractual rate changes or thresholds, built-in declines in applicable contractual rates, and/or changes in net invested capital balances. The weighted-average management fee rate from SMAs was approximately 0.40 and 0.39 of average FEAUM for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 Management fees from focused commingled funds are generally based on a specified fee rate applied against client capital commitments during a defined investment or commitment period. Thereafter, management fees are typically calculated based on a contractual rate applied against net invested capital, or a stepped-down fee rate applied against the initial commitment. The weighted-average management fee rate from focused commingled funds was approximately 0.88 and 1.03 of average FEAUM for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and primarily reflected the timing of new funds, and shifts in asset class mix. 
 The weighted-average management fee rate across SMAs and focused commingled funds was approximately 0.57 and 0.63 of average FEAUM for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and primarily reflected the timing of new funds and shifts in mix between SMAs and focused commingled funds. 
 53 

Fee revenues from advisory, StepStone Portfolio Analytics Reporting SPAR and SPI Research are generally annual fixed fees, which vary based on the scope of services we provide. We also provide certain project-based or event-driven advisory services. The fees for these services are negotiated and typically paid upon successful delivery of services or on the execution of the event-driven service. Because advisory fees are negotiated and typically paid upon successful delivery of services or on the execution of the event-driven service, advisory fees do not necessarily correlate with the total size of our AUA. 
 Management fees are reflected net of (i) certain professional and administrative services that we arrange to be performed by third parties on behalf of investment funds and (ii) certain distribution and servicing fees paid to third-party financial institutions. In both situations, we are acting as an agent because we do not control the services provided by the third parties before they are transferred to the customer. 
 Performance Fees 
 We earn two types of performance fee revenues: incentive fees and carried interest allocations, as described below. As of September 30, 2024, we had over 85 billion of performance fee-eligible capital (excluding certain legacy Greenspring funds) across over 200 programs. 
 Incentive fees comprise fees earned from certain client investment mandates for which we do not have a general partnership interest in a StepStone Fund. Incentive fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the profits (up to 15 earned in respect of certain accounts, including certain permanent capital vehicles, for which we are the investment adviser, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels or performance benchmarks. Incentive fees are a form of variable consideration and represent contractual fee arrangements in our contracts with our customers. Incentive fees are typically subject to reversal until the end of a defined performance period, as these fees are affected by changes in the fair value of the assets under management or advisement over such performance period. Moreover, incentive fees that are received prior to the end of the defined performance period are typically subject to clawback, net of tax. 
 We recognize incentive fee revenue only when these amounts are realized and no longer subject to significant risk of reversal, which is typically at the end of a defined performance period and/or upon expiration of the associated clawback period (i.e., crystallization). However, clawback terms for incentive fees received prior to crystallization only require the return of amounts on a net of tax basis. Accordingly, the tax-related portion of incentive fees received in advance of crystallization is not subject to clawback and is therefore recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. Incentive fees received in advance of crystallization that remain subject to clawback are recorded as deferred incentive fee revenue and included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Carried interest allocations include the allocation of performance-based fees, commonly referred to as carried interest, to us from limited partners in the StepStone Funds in which we hold an equity interest. We are entitled to a carried interest allocation (typically 5 to 20 based on cumulative fund or account performance to date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. These carried interest allocations are subject to the achievement of minimum return levels (typically 5 to 10 ), in accordance with the terms set forth in the respective fund s governing documents. We account for our investment balances in the StepStone Funds, including carried interest allocations, under the equity method of accounting because we are presumed to have significant influence as the general partner or managing member. Accordingly, carried interest allocations are not deemed to be within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ASC 606 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 
 54 

Legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations include the allocation of carried interest to legacy Greenspring general partner entities from limited partners in certain legacy Greenspring funds in which the legacy Greenspring general partner entities hold an equity interest. The legacy Greenspring general partner entities are entitled to a carried interest allocation (typically 5 to 20 based on cumulative fund or account performance to date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. We account for the investment balances in the legacy Greenspring funds, including carried interest allocations, under the equity method of accounting because we are presumed to have significant influence as the general partner or managing member. Accordingly, legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations are not deemed to be within the scope of ASC 606. We do not have any direct economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities and thus are not entitled to any carried interest allocation from the legacy Greenspring funds. All of the carried interest allocations in respect of such legacy Greenspring funds are payable to employees who are considered affiliates to us and are therefore reflected as legacy Greenspring performance fee-related compensation in the consolidated statements of income. 
 We recognize revenue attributable to carried interest allocations from a StepStone Fund based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund s governing documents, assuming the fund was liquidated based on the current fair value of its underlying investments as of that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized as carried interest allocation revenue reflects our share of the gains and losses of the associated fund s underlying investments measured at their then-fair values, relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. We record the amount of carried interest allocated to us as of each period end as accrued carried interest allocations, which is included as a component of investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our determination of fair value for investments in the underlying funds includes various valuation techniques. These techniques may include a market approach, recent transaction price, net asset value approach, or discounted cash flows, and may use one or more significant unobservable inputs such as EBITDA, revenue multiples, discount rates, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiples, or terminal growth rates. 
 Carried interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund s cumulative returns are in excess of the specific hurdle rates, as defined in the applicable governing documents. Carried interest is subject to reversal to the extent that the amount received to date exceeds the amount due to us based on cumulative results. As such, a liability is accrued for the potential clawback obligations if amounts previously distributed to us would require repayment to a fund if such fund were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of their underlying investments as of the reporting date. Actual repayment obligations generally do not become realized until the end of a fund s life. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, no material amounts for potential clawback obligations had been accrued. 
 Expenses 
 Cash-based compensation primarily includes salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and employer-related payroll taxes. 
 Equity-based compensation represents grants of equity related awards or arrangements to certain employees and directors and expense associated with the employee stock purchase plan ESPP ). 
 Performance fee-related compensation represents the portion of carried interest allocation revenue and incentive fees that have been awarded to employees as a form of long-term incentive compensation. Performance fee-related compensation is generally tied to the investment performance of the StepStone Funds. Approximately 50 of carried interest allocation revenue is awarded to employees as part of our long-term incentive compensation plan, fostering alignment of interest with our clients and investors, and retaining key investment professionals. Carried interest-related compensation is accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related carried interest allocation revenue and, until paid, is recorded as a component of accrued carried interest-related compensation in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amounts presented as realized indicate the amounts paid or payable to employees based on the receipt of carried interest allocation revenue from realized investment 
 55 

activity. Carried interest-related compensation expense may be subject to reversal to the extent that the related carried interest allocation revenue is reversed. Carried interest-related compensation paid to employees may be subject to clawback on an after-tax basis under certain scenarios. To date, no material amounts of realized carried interest-related compensation have been reversed. Incentive fee-related compensation is accrued as compensation expense when it is probable and estimable that payment will be made. On April 1, 2024, certain of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries underwent transactions to effect unitization of the outstanding limited partnership interests, including the class of interests relating to awards of carried interest allocations granted to employees, to combine into a single class of limited partnership interests and redesignated into units. The class of interests relating to awards of carried interest allocations granted to employees were previously presented as carried interest-related compensation expense. 
 Legacy Greenspring performance fee-related compensation represents the legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations which are entirely payable to certain employees. Legacy Greenspring carried interest-related compensation is accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenue and, until paid, is recorded as a component of legacy Greenspring accrued carried interest-related compensation in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Legacy Greenspring carried interest-related compensation expense may be subject to reversal to the extent that the related legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenue is reversed. However, none of the legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenue is attributable to the Company. 
 General, administrative and other includes occupancy, travel and related costs, insurance, legal and other professional fees, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, system-related costs, and other general costs associated with operating our business. General, administrative and other includes costs associated with the Consolidated Funds. Expenses of the Consolidated Funds have no impact on net income or loss attributable to us to the extent such expenses are borne by third-party investors. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Investment income (loss) primarily represents our share of earnings (losses) from the investments we make in our SMAs and focused commingled funds. We, either directly or through our subsidiaries, generally have a general partner interest in the StepStone Funds, which invest in primary funds, secondary funds and co-investment funds, or a combination thereof. Investment income will increase or decrease based on the earnings of the StepStone Funds, which are primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on the underlying investments held by the funds. Our co-investment funds invest in underlying portfolio companies and therefore their valuation changes from period to period are more influenced by individual companies than our primary and secondary funds, which have exposures across multiple portfolio companies in underlying private markets funds. Our SMAs and focused commingled funds invest across various industries, strategies and geographies. 
 Consequently, our general partner investments do not include any significant concentrations in a specific sector or geography outside the United States. Investment income and legacy Greenspring investment income exclude carried interest allocations, which are presented as revenues as described above. 
 Legacy Greenspring investment income (loss) represents our share of earnings (losses) from the investments we make in certain legacy Greenspring funds through the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. We have no direct economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. As a result, all such income is reflected as non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities. Legacy Greenspring investment income will increase or decrease based on the earnings of such legacy Greenspring funds, which are primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on the underlying investments held by the funds. 
 Investment income (loss) of Consolidated Funds represents gains (losses) from the investments held by the Consolidated Funds. 
 56 

Interest income consists of income earned on cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and amounts associated with the Consolidated Funds. 
 Interest expense primarily consists of the interest expense on the Revolver, as well as the related amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Other income (loss) includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, non-operating activities, and amounts associated with the Consolidated Funds 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We are a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by the Partnership. The Partnership is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As such, income generated by the Partnership flows through to its limited partners, including us, and is generally not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax at the Partnership level. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally operate as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with certain of these entities subject to local or non-U.S. income taxes. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction income taxes at the entity level which are reflected within income tax expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. As a result, the Partnership does not record U.S. federal and state income taxes on income generated by the Partnership or its subsidiaries, except for certain local and foreign income taxes discussed above. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 Non-controlling interests reflect the portion of income or loss and the corresponding equity attributable to third-party equity holders and employees in certain consolidated subsidiaries that are not 100 owned by us. Non-controlling interests are presented as separate components in our condensed consolidated statements of income to clearly distinguish between our interests and the economic interests of third parties and employees in those entities. Net income (loss) attributable to SSG, as reported in the condensed consolidated statements of income, is presented net of the portion of net income (loss) attributable to holders of non-controlling interests. 
 Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the economic interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Partnership held by third parties and employees in those entities. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are allocated a share of income or loss in the respective consolidated subsidiary in proportion to their relative ownership interests, after consideration of contractual arrangements that govern allocations of income or loss. 
 Non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities represent the economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. We did not acquire any direct economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. As a result, all of the net income (loss) attributable to the legacy Greenspring general partner entities is allocated to non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities. 
 Non-controlling interests in the Partnership represent the economic interests in the Partnership held by the Class B, Class C and Class D unitholders of the Partnership. Non-controlling interests in the Partnership are allocated a share of income or loss in the Partnership in proportion to their relative ownership interests, after consideration of contractual arrangements that govern allocations of income or loss. 
 Redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds represent the economic interests in the Consolidated Funds which are not held by us, but are held by the third-party investors in the funds. Redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds are allocated a share of income or loss in the respective fund in proportion to their relative ownership interests, after consideration of contractual arrangements that govern allocations of income or loss. 
 57 

Redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the redeemable economic interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Partnership held by third parties and employees in those entities that were established in connection with the Transaction Agreements. Redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are allocated a share of income or loss in the respective consolidated subsidiary in proportion to their relative ownership interests, after consideration of contractual arrangements that govern allocations of income or loss. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 We monitor certain operating metrics that are either common to the asset management industry or that we believe provide important data regarding our business. 
 Assets Under Management 
 AUM primarily reflects the assets associated with our SMAs and focused commingled funds. We classify assets as AUM if we have full discretion over the investment decisions in an account or have responsibility or custody of assets. Although management fees are based on a variety of factors and are not linearly correlated with AUM, we believe AUM is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our asset management business. 
 Our AUM is calculated as the sum of (i) the net asset value NAV of client portfolio assets, including the StepStone Funds and (ii) the unfunded commitments of clients to the underlying investments and the StepStone Funds. Our AUM reflects the investment valuations in respect of the underlying investments of our funds and accounts on a three-month lag, adjusted for new client account activity through the period end. Our AUM does not include post-period investment valuation or cash activity. AUM as of September 30, 2024 reflects final data for the prior period (June 30, 2024), adjusted for net new client account activity through September 30, 2024. NAV data for underlying investments is as of June 30, 2024, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024. When NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV. 
 Assets Under Advisement 
 AUA consists of client assets for which we do not have full discretion to make investment decisions but play a role in advising the client or monitoring their investments. We generally earn revenue for advisory-related services on a contractual fixed fee basis. Advisory-related services include asset allocation, strategic planning, development of investment policies and guidelines, screening and recommending investments, legal negotiations, monitoring and reporting on investments, and investment manager review and due diligence. Advisory fees vary by client based on the scope of services, investment activity and other factors. Most of our advisory fees are fixed, and therefore, increases or decreases in AUA do not necessarily lead to proportionate changes in revenue. We believe AUA is a useful metric for assessing the relative size of our advisory business. 
 Our AUA is calculated as the sum of (i) the NAV of client portfolio assets for which we do not have full discretion and (ii) the unfunded commitments of clients to the underlying investments. Our AUA reflects the investment valuations in respect of the underlying investments of our client accounts on a three-month lag, adjusted for new client account activity through the period end. Our AUA does not include post-period investment valuation or cash activity. AUA as of September 30, 2024 reflects final data for the prior period (June 30, 2024), adjusted for net new client account activity through September 30, 2024. NAV data for underlying investments is as of June 30, 2024, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024. When NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV. 
 58 

Fee-Earning AUM 
 FEAUM reflects the assets from which we earn management fee revenue (i.e., fee basis) and includes assets in our SMAs, focused commingled funds and assets held directly by our clients for which we have fiduciary oversight and are paid fees as the manager of the assets. Our SMAs and focused commingled funds typically pay management fees based on capital commitments, net invested capital and, in certain cases, NAV, depending on the fee terms. Management fees are only marginally affected by market appreciation or depreciation because substantially all of the StepStone Funds pay management fees based on capital commitments or net invested capital. As a result, management fees and FEAUM are not materially affected by changes in market value. We believe FEAUM is a useful metric in order to assess assets forming the basis of our management fee revenue. 
 Our calculation of FEAUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. 
 Undeployed Fee-Earning Capital 
 Undeployed fee-earning capital represents the amount of capital commitments to StepStone Funds that has not yet been invested or considered active but will generate management fee revenue once this capital is invested or activated. We believe undeployed fee-earning capital is a useful metric for measuring the amount of capital that we can put to work in the future and thus earn management fee revenue thereon. 
 Consolidation of StepStone Funds 
 The activity of the Consolidated Funds is reflected within the condensed consolidated financial statement line items as indicated by reference thereto. The impact of the Consolidated Funds decrease revenues reported under GAAP to the extent these amounts are eliminated upon consolidation. The assets and liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are typically non-recourse to us. The net economic ownership interests of our Consolidated Funds held by third parties are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We generally deconsolidate funds when we are no longer deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the entity. The performance of our Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with, or representative of, the combined performance trends of all of our funds. 
 59 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 We consolidate funds and entities where we are deemed to hold a controlling financial interest. The Consolidated Funds are not necessarily the same entities in each year presented due to changes in ownership, changes in limited partners or investor rights, and the creation and termination of funds and entities. The following is a discussion of our unaudited consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The information is derived from our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Revenues 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues increased 80.3 million, or 42 , to 271.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase was driven by higher management and advisory fees, net, higher carried interest allocations, and positive legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations in the current period as compared to a reversal in the prior year period, partially offset by lower incentive fees, in each case, as described below. 
 Management and advisory fees, net increased 42.6 million, or 30 , to 184.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by new client activity and 17 growth in average FEAUM across the platform. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included retroactive fees of 14.9 million from the closings of StepStone s Secondary Opportunities V, special situation real estate secondaries, and infrastructure co-investment funds. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included retroactive fees of 3.7 million from the closings of StepStone s Secondary Opportunities V and VC Global Partners XI funds. 
 Incentive fees decreased 1.8 million, or 36 , to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower realization activity. 
 Realized carried interest allocation revenues increased 16.0 million to 17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting higher realization activity within our private equity and infrastructure funds. Unrealized carried interest allocation revenues include the reversal of realized carried interest allocation revenues. Excluding the reversal of 17.6 million, unrealized carried interest allocation revenues increased 12.9 million, or 23 , to 69.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in unrealized carried interest allocations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected a higher net increase in the cumulative allocation of gains associated with the underlying portfolios within our infrastructure funds. 
 Legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenues increased 26.5 million to 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of net unrealized appreciation in the fair value of certain underlying fund investments in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. The three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect gross realized carried interest allocations of 11.9 million and unrealized carried interest allocations, net of the reversal of realized carried interest allocations, of 2.0 million. The three months ended September 30, 2023 reflect gross realized carried interest allocations of 25.0 million and unrealized carried interest allocations, net of the reversal of realized carried interest allocations, of (37.6) million. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues increased 88.6 million, or 24 , to 458.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase was driven by higher management and advisory fees, net, and positive legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations in the current period as compared to a reversal in the prior year period, partially offset by a decrease in carried interest allocations and lower incentive fees, in each case, as described below. 
 61 

Management and advisory fees, net increased 82.5 million, or 29 , to 362.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by new client activity and 13 growth in average FEAUM across the platform. The six months ended September 30, 2024 included retroactive fees of 31.5 million from the closings of StepStone s Secondary Opportunities V, special situation real estate secondaries, infrastructure co-investment, and VC Global Partners XI funds. The six months ended September 30, 2023 included retroactive fees of 5.3 million from the closings of StepStone s Secondary Opportunities V, VC Global Partners XI and infrastructure co-investment funds. 
 Incentive fees decreased 1.0 million, or 19 , to 4.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower realization activity. 
 Realized carried interest allocation revenues increased 43.4 million, or 270 , to 59.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting higher realization activity within our private equity and infrastructure funds. Unrealized carried interest allocation revenues include the reversal of realized carried interest allocation revenues. Excluding the reversal of 59.4 million, unrealized carried interest allocation revenues decreased 34.3 million, or 28 , to 86.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in unrealized carried interest allocations for the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected a lower net increase in the cumulative allocation of gains associated with the underlying portfolios within our private equity funds. 
 Legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenues increased 41.4 million to 4.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower net unrealized depreciation in the fair value of certain underlying fund investments in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. The six months ended September 30, 2024 reflect gross realized carried interest allocations of 18.6 million and unrealized carried interest allocations, net of the reversal of realized carried interest allocations, of (13.7) million. The six months ended September 30, 2023 reflect gross realized carried interest allocations of 25.9 million and unrealized carried interest allocations, net of the reversal of realized carried interest allocations, of (62.5) million. 
 Expenses 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total expenses increased 90.4 million, or 69 , to 220.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Cash-based compensation increased 8.0 million, or 11 , to 82.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased staffing and compensation levels. Our average headcount was 5 higher in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
 Equity-based compensation increased 31.4 million, or 531 , to 37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 30.8 million increase in expenses for liability classified awards related to the profits interest issued in the private wealth subsidiary in the current year period as compared to the prior year period, additional grants of RSUs made in February 2024 and no comparable expense for these grants in the prior year period, and expense related to the first offering period for the employee stock purchase plan.

 General, administrative and other expenses increased 18.3 million, or 58 , to 50.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase primarily reflected increases of 13.8 million due to loss on change in fair value for contingent consideration obligation as compared to gain on change in fair value for contingent consideration obligation in the prior period, 1.5 million in professional fees, 1.4 million in travel and associated costs for investment evaluation and client service, 1.1 million in information and technology expenses and other general operating expenses. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total expenses increased 108.4 million, or 43 , to 359.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase resulted from increases in equity-based compensation, legacy Greenspring performance fee-related compensation, general, administrative and other expenses, and cash-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in performance fee-related compensation in each case, as described below. 
 Cash-based compensation increased 16.2 million, or 11 , to 161.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased staffing and compensation levels. Our average headcount was 6 higher in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
 Equity-based compensation increased 42.1 million, or 293 , to 56.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 40.4 million increase in expenses for liability classified awards related to the profits interest issued in the private wealth subsidiary in the current year period as compared to the prior year period, additional grants of RSUs made in February 2024 and no comparable expense for these grants in the prior year period, and expense related to the first offering period for the ESPP. 
 Performance fee-related compensation expense decreased 17.3 million, or 27 , to 46.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting the decrease in carried interest allocation revenue. Realized performance fee-related compensation increased 18.8 million, or 174 , to 29.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher realization activity.

 Other Income (Expense) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Investment income decreased 1.0 million, or 33 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting overall changes in the valuations of the underlying investments in the StepStone Funds. 
 Legacy Greenspring investment loss increased 0.1 million, or 2 , to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Other income (loss) increased 2.0 million to income of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting net foreign currency transaction gains in the current period as compared with net foreign currency transaction losses in the prior year period. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Investment income decreased 1.5 million, or 25 , to 4.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting overall changes in the valuations of the underlying investments in the StepStone Funds. 
 Legacy Greenspring investment loss decreased 1.5 million, or 23 , to 5.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The six months ended September 30, 2024 reflected gross realized investment income of 2.9 million and unrealized investment loss, net of the reversal of realized investment income, of 8.1 million. The six months ended September 30, 2023 reflected gross realized investment income of 4.1 million and unrealized investment loss, net of the reversal of realized investment income, of 11.0 million. 
 Investment income of Consolidated Funds increased 4.7 million, or 42 , to 15.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting overall changes in the valuations of the underlying investments of the Consolidated Funds. 
 Interest income increased 3.7 million, or 260 , to 5.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during the current year period as compared with the prior year period. Interest income attributable to the Consolidated Funds was 2.3 million in the current year period as compared to 0.5 million in the prior year period. 
 Interest expense increased 2.4 million, or 58 , to 6.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other income (loss) increased 1.5 million to income of 0.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting net foreign currency transaction gains in the current period as compared with net foreign currency transaction losses in the prior year period. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense primarily reflects U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by the Partnership, as well as local and foreign income taxes of certain of the Partnership s subsidiaries. 
 Our effective income tax rate was 8.2 and 11.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 10.2 and 13.1 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate in each of the periods described above is less than the statutory rate as a portion of income was allocated to non-controlling interests and the tax liability on such income is borne by the holders of non-controlling interests. The primary rate difference was driven by an increase in tax benefits related to income allocated to non-controlling interests, as well as an increase in tax benefits associated with the vesting of RSUs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 65 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Income tax expense decreased 3.0 million, or 39 , to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and an increased tax benefit from the vesting of RSUs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Income tax expense decreased 4.8 million, or 29 , to 11.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and an increased tax benefit from the vesting of RSUs for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries increased 9.5 million, or 99 , to 19.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income generated by our consolidated subsidiaries not wholly-owned by us and an increase in our economic interests in the Asset Class Entities as a result of the Transaction Agreements. 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries increased 16.5 million, or 86 , to 35.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income generated by our consolidated subsidiaries not wholly-owned by us and an increase in our economic interests in the Asset Class Entities as a result of the Transaction Agreements. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Legacy Greenspring Entities 
 Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities represents the net income or loss attributable to the interests held by the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. We did not acquire any direct economic interests in the legacy Greenspring general partner entities. As a result, all of the net income or loss related to the legacy Greenspring general partner entities is allocated to non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in legacy Greenspring entities was 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 5.3 million and 6.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in the Partnership 
 Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in the Partnership represents the portion of net income or loss attributable to the interests held by the Class B, Class C and Class D unitholders of the Partnership. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the Partnership was 13.6 million and 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 26.9 million and 42.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 66 

Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds 
 Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds represents income of the Consolidated Funds attributable to third-party investors. Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds was 6.5 million and 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12.2 million and 6.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries 
 Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries was 0.3 million and 0.7 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. There were no redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Below is a description of our non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are presented on a basis other than GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 68 

Adjusted Net Income 
 Adjusted net income ANI is a non-GAAP performance measure that we present before the consolidation of StepStone Funds on a pre-tax and after-tax basis used to evaluate profitability. ANI represents the after-tax net realized income attributable to us. ANI does not reflect legacy Greenspring carried interest allocation revenues, legacy Greenspring carried interest-related compensation and legacy Greenspring investment income (loss) as none of the economics are attributable to us. The components of revenues used in the determination of ANI adjusted revenues comprise adjusted management and advisory fees, net, adjusted incentive fees (including the deferred portion) and realized carried interest allocations. In addition, ANI excludes: (a) unrealized carried interest allocation revenues and related compensation, (b) unrealized investment income (loss), (c) equity-based compensation for awards granted prior to and in connection with our IPO, profits interests issued by our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, and unrealized mark-to-market changes in the fair value of the profits interests issued in SPW, (d) amortization of intangibles, (e) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries and realized gains attributable to the profits interests issued in SPW, (f) charges associated with acquisitions and corporate transactions, and (g) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance (as listed in the below table). ANI is fully taxed at our blended statutory rate. We believe ANI and adjusted revenues are useful to investors because they enable investors to evaluate the performance of our business across reporting periods. 
 Adjusted Revenues 
 Adjusted revenues represents the components of revenues used in the determination of ANI and comprise adjusted management and advisory fees, net, adjusted incentive fees (including the deferred portion) and realized carried interest allocations. We believe adjusted revenues is useful to investors because it presents a measure of realized revenues. 
 Fee-Related Earnings 
 Fee-related earnings FRE is a non-GAAP performance measure used to monitor our baseline earnings from recurring management and advisory fees. FRE is a component of ANI and comprises adjusted management and advisory fees, net, less adjusted expenses which are operating expenses other than (a) performance fee-related compensation, (b) equity-based compensation for awards granted prior to and in connection with our IPO, profits interests issued by our non-wholly owned subsidiaries, and unrealized mark-to-market changes in the fair value of the profits interests issued in SPW, (c) amortization of intangibles, (d) charges associated with acquisitions and corporate transactions, and (e) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance (as listed in the below table). FRE is presented before income taxes. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our business and our ability to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. 
 Adjusted Weighted-Average Shares and Adjusted Net Income Per Share 
 ANI per share measures our per-share earnings assuming all Class B units, Class C units and Class D units in the Partnership were exchanged for Class A common stock in SSG, including the dilutive impact of outstanding equity-based awards. ANI per share is calculated as ANI divided by adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding. We believe adjusted weighted-average shares and ANI per share are useful to investors because they enable investors to better evaluate per-share operating performance across reporting periods. 
 69 

Fee-Related Earnings 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 FRE increased 28.5 million, or 65 , to 72.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher adjusted management and advisory fees, net, partially offset by higher adjusted cash-based compensation, adjusted general, administrative and other expenses, and adjusted equity-based compensation. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 FRE increased 55.8 million, or 63 , to 144.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher adjusted management and advisory fees, net, partially offset by higher adjusted cash-based compensation, adjusted general, administrative and other expenses, and adjusted equity-based compensation. 
 Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Net Income 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted revenues increased 59.0 million, or 39 , to 208.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting increases in adjusted management and advisory fees, net, and realized carried interest allocation revenues. 
 ANI increased 23.4 million, or 78 , to 53.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in FRE as discussed above, higher net realized performance fee-related earnings (adjusted incentive fees, including the deferred portion, plus realized carried interest allocation revenues, less realized performance fee-related compensation) and higher realized investment income. The overall increase was partially offset by a higher allocation of income to non-controlling interests and higher interest expense. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted revenues increased 127.4 million, or 42 , to 430.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting increases in adjusted management and advisory fees, net, realized carried interest allocation revenues, and adjusted incentive fees, including the deferred portion. 
 ANI increased 51.2 million, or 86 , to 110.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in FRE as discussed above, higher net realized performance fee-related earnings (adjusted incentive fees, including the deferred portion, plus realized carried interest allocation revenues, less realized performance fee-related compensation) and higher realized investment income. The overall increase was partially offset by a higher allocation of income to non-controlling interests and higher interest expense.

 The table below shows a reconciliation of GAAP measures to additional non-GAAP measures. We use the non-GAAP measures presented below as components when calculating FRE and ANI. We believe these additional non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating both the baseline earnings from recurring management and advisory fees, which provide additional insight into the operating profitability of our business, and the after-tax net realized income attributable to us, allowing investors to evaluate the performance of our business. These additional non-GAAP measures remove the impact of Consolidated Funds that we are required to consolidate under GAAP, and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance.

 Investment Performance 
 The following table presents information relating to the performance of all the investments that StepStone has recommended and subsequently tracked across asset classes and investment strategies, except as set forth in greater detail below. The data for these investments are generally presented from the inception date of each strategy and asset class through June 30, 2024 and have not been adjusted to reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments subsequent to that date. 
 The historical results of our investments are not indicative of future results to be expected of existing or new investment funds, and are not a proxy for the performance of our Class A common stock, including because: 
 market conditions and investment opportunities may differ from those in the past; 
 the performance of our funds is largely based on the NAV (as defined below) of the funds investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized; 
 newly-established funds may generate lower investment returns during the period that they initially deploy their capital; 
 changes in the global tax and regulatory environment may impact both the investment preferences of our clients and the financing strategies employed by businesses in which particular funds invest, which may reduce the overall capital available for investment and the availability of suitable investments, thereby reducing investment returns in the future; 
 competition for investment opportunities, resulting from the increasing amount of capital invested in private markets alternatives, may increase the cost and reduce the availability of suitable investments, thereby reducing investment returns in the future; and 
 the industries and businesses in which particular funds invest will vary. 
 Historical and future returns of investments included in our track record are not directly correlated to potential returns on our Class A common stock. 
 For the purposes of the following table: 
 Invested capital refers to the total amount of all investments made by a fund, including commitment-reducing and non-commitment-reducing capital calls; 
 NAV refers to the estimated fair value of unrealized investments plus any net assets or liabilities associated with the investment as of June 30, 2024; 
 74 

IRR refers to the annualized internal rate of return for all investments within the relevant investment strategy on an inception-to-date basis as of June 30, 2024 (except as noted otherwise below), based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value; 
 Net IRR refers to IRR net of fees and expenses charged by both the underlying fund managers and StepStone; and 
 Net TVM refers to the total value to paid-in capital or invested capital expressed as a multiple, and is calculated as distributions plus unrealized valuations divided by invested capital (including all capitalized costs).

 (1) Investment returns reflect NAV data for underlying investments as of June 30, 2024, as reported by underlying managers up to the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024. For investment returns where NAV data is not available by the business day occurring on or after 100 days following June 30, 2024, such NAVs are adjusted for cash activity following the last available reported NAV. Investment returns are calculated on a constant currency adjusted reporting basis converting non-USD investment cash flows and NAVs to USD using the foreign currency exchange rate corresponding to each client s first cash flow date. 
 (2) Private equity includes 2,797 investments totaling 195.8 billion of capital commitments and excludes (i) two advisory co-investments, totaling 100.0 million of capital commitments, (ii) 258 client-directed private equity investments, totaling 30.8 billion of capital commitments, and (iii) investments for which StepStone does not provide monitoring and reporting services to the client that made the investment. Private equity includes buyout, venture capital, growth equity, fund-of-funds, and energy focused strategies. StepStone s venture capital and growth equity strategy is composed of a) venture capital and growth equity focused commingled funds and separately managed accounts (the StepStone VC Platform and b) underlying venture capital and growth equity investments within StepStone s broader private equity funds. 
 (3) Net IRR and Net TVM are presented solely for illustrative purposes and do not represent actual returns received by any investor in any of the StepStone Funds represented above and are net of fees and expenses charged by both the underlying investment and hypothetical StepStone fees. The aggregate returns are not indicative of the returns an individual investor would receive from these investments. No individual investor received the aggregate returns described herein as the investments were made across multiple mandates over multiple years. StepStone fees and expenses are based on the following assumptions (management fees and expenses represent an annual rate, charged quarterly): 
 i. Primaries management fee: 25 basis points of net invested capital for private equity, real estate and infrastructure; 25 basis points of net asset value for private debt; 75 basis points of committed capital for the StepStone VC Platform. 
 ii. Secondaries management fee: 125 basis points, 125 basis points and 95 basis points of capital commitments for private equity, real estate and infrastructure, respectively, in years 1 through 4 for management fees, charged quarterly. In year 5, management fees step down to 90 of the previous year s fee; 65 basis points of net asset value for private debt; 75 basis points of committed capital for the StepStone VC Platform. 
 75 

iii. Co-investments management fee: 100 basis points of net committed capital for private equity and real estate; 85 and 50 basis points of net committed capital for infrastructure co-investments and direct asset management investments, respectively; 65 basis points of net asset value for private debt; 200 basis points of net invested capital for the StepStone VC Platform. 
 iv. All investments assess 5 basis points of capital commitments for fund expenses, charged quarterly, and 1 basis point of capital commitments drawn down in the first cash flow quarter for organizational costs. 
 v. Private equity secondaries and co-investments include 12.5 and 10.0 of paid and unrealized carry, respectively, with an 8.0 preferred return hurdle; infrastructure secondaries and co-investments include 10.0 of paid and unrealized carry, respectively, with an 8.0 preferred return hurdle; real estate secondaries and co-investments include 15.0 of paid and unrealized carry, with an 8.0 preferred return hurdle; private debt secondaries and co-investments include 10.0 of paid and unrealized carry, with a 5.0 preferred return hurdle; and the StepStone VC Platform primaries, secondaries and co-investments/directs include 5.0 , 5.0 and 20.0 , respectively, of paid and unrealized carry with no preferred return hurdle. 
 Net IRR and Net TVM for certain investments may have been impacted by StepStone s, or the underlying fund manager s, use of subscription backed credit facilities by such vehicles. Reinvested/recycled amounts increase contributed capital. 
 (4) Investments of former clients are included in performance summary past the client termination date until such time as StepStone stops receiving current investment data (quarterly valuations and cash flows) for the investment. At that point, StepStone will then liquidate the fund by entering a distribution amount equal to the last reported NAV, thus ending its contribution to the track record as of that date. Historical performance contribution will be maintained up until the liquidation date. 
 (5) Real estate includes 477 investments totaling 80.8 billion of capital commitments and excludes (i) 92 client-directed real estate investments, totaling 14.4 billion of capital commitments, (ii) 15 secondary/co-investment core/core+ or credit investments, totaling 890.8 million of capital commitments, (iii) four advisory fund investments totaling 463.6 million of capital commitments, and (iv) investments for which StepStone does not provide monitoring and reporting services to the client that made the investment. 
 (6) Infrastructure includes 277 investments totaling 56.7 billion of capital commitments and excludes (i) 11 infrastructure investments made by the Partnership prior to the formation of the infrastructure subsidiary in 2013 or made prior to StepStone s acquisition of Courtland Partners, Ltd. on April 1, 2018 (the Courtland acquisition ), totaling 501.9 million of capital commitments, (ii) 34 client-directed infrastructure investments, totaling 6.4 billion of capital commitments, and (iii) investments for which StepStone does not provide monitoring and reporting services to the client that made the investment. 
 (7) Co-investments include venture capital and growth equity direct investments for private equity. 
 (8) Private debt includes 975 investments totaling 51.7 billion of capital commitments and excludes (i) 42 client-directed debt investments, totaling 3.2 billion of capital commitments, (ii) 51 real estate credit investments that were recommended by Courtland Partners, Ltd. prior to the Courtland acquisition, totaling 5.1 billion of capital commitments, and (iii) investments for which StepStone does not provide monitoring and reporting services to the client that made the investment. 
 (9) Other includes mezzanine debt, collateralized loan obligations, leasing, regulatory capital, trade finance, intellectual property/royalty, real estate debt and infrastructure debt. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 We generate cash primarily from management and advisory fees and performance fees. We have historically managed our liquidity and capital resource needs through (a) cash generated from our operating activities, (b) realizations from investment activities, (c) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements and other borrowing arrangements, (d) funding capital commitments to our funds, and (e) funding our growth initiatives, including capital expenditures for property, equipment, and acquisitions to expand into new businesses. 
 76 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 179.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 225.4 million including Consolidated Funds) and 1,537.0 million of investments in StepStone Funds, including 1,381.1 million of accrued carried interest allocations, against 172.3 million in debt obligations, net of debt issuance costs, and 680.5 million in accrued carried interest-related compensation payable. 
 Ongoing sources of cash include (a) management and advisory fees, which are collected monthly or quarterly, (b) performance fees, which are volatile and largely unpredictable as to amount and timing; and (c) distributions from our investments in the StepStone Funds. We use cash flow from operations and distributions from our investments in the StepStone Funds to pay compensation and related expenses, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service, capital expenditures, dividends to our stockholders and distributions to holders of Partnership units, and to make investments in the StepStone Funds. We believe we will have sufficient cash flows to meet our liquidity and capital resources requirements for the next 12 months. 
 Cash Flows 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated cash flows include the Consolidated Funds, which activities primarily consist of raising capital from third-party investors, purchasing investments, making payment for the operating costs of the fund, generating cash flows from realized income allocations of investments and sales of investments, and making distributions to investors. The Consolidated Funds are accounted for as investment companies and therefore the cash flows from investing activities are included in cash flows from operations. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows attributable to operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 103,866 128,717 Net cash used in investing activities (34,089) (27,405) Net cash used in financing activities (23,623) (53,434) Effect of exchange rate changes (3,085) (593) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 43,069 47,285 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided 103.9 million and 128.7 million of cash for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, these amounts primarily consisted of the following: 
 net income, after adjustments for non-cash items (including unrealized carried interest allocations, unrealized performance fee-related compensation, unrealized investment (income) loss and acquisition-related contingent consideration), of 190.2 million and 110.2 million; 
 net change in operating assets and liabilities of 14.6 million and 49.9 million; 
 adjustments for unrealized investment income from Consolidated Funds of 15.6 million and 11.1 million;

 proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock under ESPP of 1.1 million and 0 million; 
 payments to related parties under the Tax Receivable Agreements of 9.8 million and 7.7 million; and 
 contributions from redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds of 90.8 million and 28.7 million. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 We are party to a credit agreement, as amended and restated in May 2024 (the Credit Agreement ), which, among other things, increased the aggregate principal amount of the commitments thereunder to 300.0 million from 225.0 million and extended the maturity date of the revolving facility to May 2029. The Credit Agreement was arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other lenders party thereto and provides for a 300.0 million multicurrency Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had 172.3 million outstanding on the Revolver, net of debt issuance costs. 
 78 

Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at a variable rate per annum. We may designate each borrowing as (i) in the case of any borrowing in U.S. dollars, a base rate loan or a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate loan, (ii) in the case of any borrowing denominated in Euros, a EURIBOR rate loan, (iii) in the case of any borrowing denominated in British Pounds Sterling, a Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA loan, (iv) in the case of any borrowing denominated in Swiss Francs, a Swiss Average Rate Overnight SARON loan, and (v) in the case of any borrowing denominated in Australian dollars, an AUD rate loan. Borrowings bear interest equal to (i) in the case of base rate loans, 1.00 plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50 and (c) the 1 month Term SOFR, plus 1.10 , (ii) in the case of a Term SOFR rate loan, the Term SOFR rate plus 2.10 , (iii) in the case of a EURIBOR rate loan, the EURIBOR rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 2.00 , (iv) in the case of a SONIA loan, the Sterling Overnight Index Average plus 2.03 , (v) in the case of a SARON loan, the Swiss Average Rate Overnight plus 2.00 , and (vi) in the case of an AUD rate loan, the AUD Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 2.20 , in certain cases subject to applicable interest rate floors. The weighted-average interest rate in effect for the Revolver as of September 30, 2024 was 7.41 . 
 Borrowings under the Revolver may be repaid at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement and, subject to certain terms and conditions, may be reborrowed prior to the maturity date. Any outstanding principal amounts, together with any accrued interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the maturity date. The maturity date for the Revolver is May 16, 2029. 
 The Revolver bears a fee on undrawn commitments equal to 0.25 per annum if total utilization of revolving commitments is equal to or greater than 50 and 0.35 per annum if total utilization of revolving commitments is less than 50 . 
 Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, certain of our assets serve as pledged collateral. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things: limit our ability to incur indebtedness; create, incur or allow liens; transfer or dispose of assets; merge with other companies; make certain investments; pay dividends or make distributions; engage in new or different lines of business; and engage in transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a total net leverage ratio, and a minimum total of fee-earning assets under management. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the total net leverage ratio and minimum fee-earning assets under management covenants. 
 We can use available funding capacity under the Revolver to satisfy letters of credit in amounts up to 10.0 million. Amounts used to satisfy the letters of credit reduce the available capacity under the Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 6.5 million. 
 Debt Transactions 
 On October 22, 2024, we issued 175.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.52 Series A senior notes due October 22, 2029 (the Notes ), pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as of October 22, 2024 (the Note Purchase Agreement ), by the Partnership and accepted and agreed to by the purchasers party thereto in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from the issue and sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes, including to make investments, repay existing debt and make distributions. 
 79 

Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 22 and October 22 of each year, commencing on April 22, 2025. Interest on the Notes will accrue from and including October 22, 2024. The Notes will mature on October 22, 2029. We may, at our option, prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 5 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof plus any applicable make-whole amount and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, provided that, so long as no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, no make-whole amount shall be due if the Notes are paid on or after April 22, 2029. 
 Equity Transactions 
 In June 2024, we issued 1,731,807 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 1,731,807 Class B units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class B Exchange Agreement. A corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and a corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. We also issued 71,766 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 71,766 Class C units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class C Exchange Agreement and a corresponding number of Class A units of the partnership were issued to us. 
 In September 2024, we conducted an underwritten public offering of 4,099,997 shares of Class A common stock (the September 2024 Offering at a public offering price of 50.00 per share. We used all of the net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, to purchase (i) 300,000 shares of our Class A common stock from certain selling stockholders, (ii) 3,094,981 Class B units of the Partnership from certain holders thereof, including certain of our directors and executive officers, and (iii) 705,016 Class C units of the Partnership from certain holders thereof. 3,094,981 shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and 3,799,997 Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. 
 Also in September 2024, we issued 312,112 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 312,112 Class B units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class B Exchange Agreement. A corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock were automatically redeemed at par value and canceled in connection with such exchange and a corresponding number of Class A units of the Partnership were issued to us. We also issued 34,027 shares of Class A common stock to certain limited partners of the Partnership in exchange for 34,027 Class C units of the Partnership pursuant to the Class C Exchange Agreement and a corresponding number of Class A units of the partnership were issued to us. 
 Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 In the future, we may issue additional equity or debt with the objective of increasing our available capital. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and our ability to obtain future financing. 
 Dividend and Distribution Policy 
 On November 7, 2024, we announced a dividend of 0.24 per share of Class A common stock, payable on December 13, 2024 to holders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2024. 
 80 

The following table presents information regarding cash quarterly dividends on Class A common shares for the periods indicated: 
 Quarterly Fiscal Period 1 
 Dividend Payment Date Dividend Per Share of Class A Common Stock First quarter June 30, 2023 0.20 Supplemental 2 
 June 30, 2023 0.25 Second quarter September 15, 2023 0.21 Third quarter December 15, 2023 0.21 Fourth quarter March 15, 2024 0.21 Total dividends paid in FY2024 1.08 First quarter June 28, 2024 0.21 Supplemental 3 
 June 28, 2024 0.15 Second quarter September 13, 2024 0.24 Total dividends paid in FY2025 0.60 _______________________________ 
 (1) Dividends paid, as reported in this table, relate to the preceding quarterly period in which they were earned. 
 (2) The supplemental cash dividend relates to earnings in respect of our full fiscal year 2023. 
 (3) The supplemental cash dividend relates to earnings in respect of our full fiscal year 2024. 
 We may pay additional dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the future. The declaration and payment by us of any future dividends to Class A stockholders is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Subject to funds being legally available, we will cause the Partnership to make pro rata distributions to its limited partners, including us, in amounts sufficient to make payment of applicable income and other taxes, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, and to make payment for corporate and other general expenses. Because our board of directors may determine to pay or not pay dividends to our Class A stockholders, our Class A stockholders may not necessarily receive dividend distributions relating to our excess distributions, even if the Partnership makes excess distributions to us. 
 Tax Receivable Agreements 
 We have entered into an Exchanges Tax Receivable Agreement with the Class B limited partners, Class C limited partners, and Class D limited partners and a Reorganization Tax Receivable Agreement with certain pre-IPO institutional investors (collectively, the Tax Receivable Agreements ). The Tax Receivable Agreements provide for payment by SSG to these partners and pre-IPO institutional investors of the Partnership of 85 of the amount of the net cash tax savings, if any, that SSG realizes (or, under certain circumstances, is deemed to realize) as a result of increases in tax basis (and utilization of certain other tax benefits) resulting from (i) SSG s acquisition of such partner s and institutional investor s Partnership units and (ii) in the case of the Exchanges Tax Receivable Agreement, any payments SSG makes under the Exchanges Tax Receivable Agreement (including tax benefits related to imputed interest). SSG will retain the benefit of the remaining 15 of these net cash tax savings under the Tax Receivable Agreements. 
 81 

Contingent Earn-out Payment 
 In connection with the Greenspring acquisition, the transaction agreement provides for the payment of an earn-out of up to 75.0 million payable in calendar year 2025, subject to the achievement of certain management fee revenue targets for calendar year 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was 67.1 million. We expect to make payment of the contingent earn-out prior to the end of fiscal 2025. See note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for more information on the contingent consideration obligation. 
 Option Agreement Payment 
 In November 2022, we entered into arrangements with the SPW management team (the Private Wealth Transaction under which certain members of the SPW team received a profits interest in SPW and concurrently entered into an option agreement which provides that (i) we have the right to acquire the profits interest at the end of any fiscal quarter after June 30, 2027 in exchange for payment of a call price and (ii) the SPW management team, through an entity named CH Equity Partners, LLC, has the right to put the profits interest to us on June 30, 2026 or at the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter, in exchange for payment of a put price. The applicable call or put price is, in certain circumstances, subject to an earn-out or earn-down. The call or put price will be payable in cash unless we elect to pay up to 75 of the consideration in units of the Partnership, each to be exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock, and, in either case, rights under one or more tax receivable agreements. As of September 30, 2024, based on the fair value of the liability classified awards, the estimated minimum and maximum amount of cash that would be potentially payable under the Private Wealth Transaction was 17.7 million and 70.8 million, respectively. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that would expose us to any liability or require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to clients in our funds that are not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. See notes 4 and 14, respectively, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for information on variable interest entities and commitments and contingencies. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual amounts may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. 
 See note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report, and note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 Information regarding recent accounting developments and their effects to us can be found in note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a broad range of risks inherent in the financial markets in which we participate, including price risk, interest-rate risk, access to and cost of financing risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and foreign exchange-rate risk. Potentially negative effects of these risks may be mitigated to a certain extent by those aspects of our investment approach, investment strategies, fundraising practices or other business activities that are designed to benefit, either in relative or absolute terms, from periods of economic weakness, tighter credit markets or financial market dislocations. 
 Market Risk 
 Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment manager for our focused commingled funds and SMAs and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, which may adversely affect our performance fee revenues and investment income. 
 Our management fee and advisory fee revenue is only marginally affected by changes in investment values because our management fees are generally based on commitments or net invested capital and our advisory fees are fixed. As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, NAV-based management fees represented approximately 11 and 9 , respectively, of total net management and advisory fees. We estimate that a 10 decline in market values of the investments held in our funds as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, would result in an approximate decrease to annual management fees of 8.3 million and 5.8 million, respectively. 
 The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of our focused commingled funds and SMAs may fluctuate in response to changes in the fair value of a fund s underlying investments, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The effect of these risks is as follows: 
 Incentive fees from our funds are not materially affected by changes in the fair value of unrealized investments because they are based on realized gains and subject to achievement of performance criteria rather than on the fair value of the fund s assets prior to realization. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 22.9 million and 20.5 million, respectively, of deferred incentive fee revenue recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 We earn carried interest allocation revenue from certain of the StepStone Funds based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to specified performance criteria. Our carried interest allocation is affected by changes in market factors. However, the degree of impact will vary depending on several factors, including but not limited to (i) the performance criteria for each individual fund in relation to how that fund s results of operations are affected by changes in market factors; (ii) whether such performance criteria are annual or over the life of the fund; (iii) to the extent applicable, the previous performance of each fund in relation to its performance criteria; and (iv) whether each funds performance related distributions are subject to contingent repayment. As a result, the impact of changes in market factors on carried interest allocation revenue will vary widely from fund to fund. An overall decrease of 10 in the general equity markets would not necessarily drive the same impact on our funds valuations, as many of our investments in our funds are illiquid and do not trade on any exchange. Additionally, as a large percentage of our carried interest allocation revenues are paid to employees as carried interest-related compensation, the overall net impact to our income would be mitigated by lower compensation payments. As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, the maximum amount of carried interest allocations (excluding legacy Greenspring carried interest allocations) subject to contingent repayment, net of tax, was an estimated 305.4 million and 287.5 million, respectively, assuming the fair value of all investments was zero, a possibility that we view as remote. The primary driver for the change in the contingent repayment between periods is due to additional carried interest allocation realizations in fiscal 2025 that are potentially subject to clawback.

Investment income changes in relation to realized and unrealized gains and losses of the underlying investments in our funds in which we have a general partner commitment. Based on investments (excluding legacy Greenspring investments in funds and investments of Consolidated Funds) held as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we estimate that a 10 decline in fair value of the investments in funds would result in a decrease in investment income of 15.6 million and 13.5 million, respectively. 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our business is affected by movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar currencies in respect of revenues and expenses of our foreign offices that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies and cash and other balances we hold in non-functional currencies. The amount of revenues and expenses attributable to our foreign offices is not material in relation to our U.S. offices. Therefore, changes in exchange rates are not expected to materially affect our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Certain of our focused commingled funds and SMAs hold investments denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies that may be affected by movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which could affect investment performance. The currency exposure related to investments in foreign currency assets is limited to our general partner interest, which is typically no more than 1 of total capital commitments. Changes in exchange rates are not expected to materially affect our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 175.0 million and 150.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under our Revolver. The Revolver accrues interest at a variable rate. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we estimate that interest expense would increase by 1.8 million and 1.5 million, respectively, on an annualized basis as a result of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Based on the 179.8 million and 144.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (excluding Consolidated Funds) as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we estimate that interest income would increase by 1.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively, on an annualized basis as a result of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the respective counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In other circumstances, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives. 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
