 of the average value of the weighted average (based on the number of shares outstanding each day in the quarter) of the Company s total net assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee for any partial quarter will be pro-rated based on the number of days actually elapsed in that quarter relative to the total number of days in such quarter. Prior to the IPO, the base management fee was of the average value of the weighted average (based on the number of shares outstanding each day in the quarter) of the Company s total net assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Investment Advisor, however, during any period prior to the IPO, agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of an annual rate of of the average value of the weighted average total net assets at the end of each of our two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Investment Advisor will not be permitted to recoup any base management fees waived for any period of time prior to the IPO. Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Investment Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee prior to the IPO because the Advisory Agreement provides that no incentive fee is payable prior to the listing of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange. Effective upon completion of the IPO, the Investment Advisor is entitled to an incentive fee (the Income Incentive Fee based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the then most recently completed calendar quarter, as adjusted downward (but not upward) if over the most recently completed and eleven preceding calendar quarters since the IPO (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters since the IPO) (each such period is referred to herein as the Trailing Twelve Quarters aggregate net realized losses on the Company s investments exceed the Company s aggregate net investment income over the same period, excluding the most recently completed quarter, as described in more detail below. In this regard, if the Company s net realized losses over the Trailing Twelve Quarters since the IPO (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters since the IPO) are greater than the Company s net investment income over the same period, excluding the most recently completed quarter, then the pre-incentive fee net income used in the calculation of the Income Incentive Fee would be subject to a downward adjustment. The amount of the adjustment would be equal to the amount by which such net realized losses exceed such net investment income. On the other hand, if the Company s net investment income over the Trailing Twelve Quarters since the IPO (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters since the IPO) is equal to or greater than the Company s net realized losses over the same period, excluding the most recently completed quarter, then no adjustment to pre-incentive fee net investment income would be made. The Income Incentive Fee will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears commencing with the first calendar quarter following the IPO. The Company will pay the Investment Advisor an Income Incentive Fee with respect to its adjusted net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: no Income Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s adjusted net investment income does not exceed an amount equal to a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) of the Company s total net assets at the end of that quarter (the Hurdle Amount 

 of the Company s adjusted net investment income with respect to that portion of such adjusted net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying by the Company s total NAV for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Investment Advisor with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s adjusted net investment income when the Company s adjusted net investment income reaches the Catch-Up Amount in any calendar quarter; and 

 for any calendar quarter in which the Company s adjusted net investment income exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Income Incentive Fee shall equal of the amount of the Company s adjusted net investment income for the calendar quarter. 

 Adjusted net investment income means the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income during the then most recently completed calendar quarter minus the difference, if positive, between (i) the Company s net realized losses over the then most recently completed and three preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since the Listing) and (ii) the Company s net investment income over the three preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since the Listing). No adjustment (downward or upward) will be made to pre-incentive fee net investment income if the difference between clause (i) minus clause (ii) is zero or negative. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Income Incentive Fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, original issue discount OID ), debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.

The CLO Transaction is backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured loans or participation interests therein with the potential for investment in second lien loans or participation interests therein, corporate bonds or loans made to a debtor-in-possession pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code having the priority allowed by either Section 364(c) or 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code and fully secured by senior liens or participation interests therein, which is managed by the Company as collateral manager pursuant to a collateral management agreement entered into with the Issuer on the Closing Date (the Collateral Management Agreement ). The Company has agreed to irrevocably waive all collateral management fees payable to it so long as it is the collateral manager under the Collateral Management Agreement. The Notes are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2037; however, the Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer, at the written direction of (i) a majority of the Subordinated Notes (with the consent of the Company, in the case of the Secured Notes) or (ii) the Company, in each case, on any business day on or after July 15, 2026.

shares at an aggregate purchase price of million and shares at an aggregate purchase price of million, respectively. These amounts include shares issued in reinvestment. Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that will provide for reinvestment of its dividends and other distributions on behalf of the Company s stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company s Board authorizes, and the Company declares a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who do not opt out of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. Prior to the IPO, the Board primarily used newly-issued shares of the Company s common stock to implement the dividend reinvestment plan. The number of shares of common stock to be issued to a participant prior to the IPO would be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the cash value of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the NAV per share as of the date such dividend was declared. After the IPO, the Board intends to primarily use newly-issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, whether or not the shares are trading at a price per share at, below or above NAV. However, the Board reserves the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of the dividend reinvestment plan. The Board will examine the full facts and circumstances of each such dividend to determine the approach (i.e., to use newly issued shares or effectuate open market purchases to implement the dividend reinvestment plan) that is in the best interests of stockholders taking into account the Board s fiduciary duties to stockholders, including by weighing the potential dilution in connection with such issuance to be incurred by the Company s stockholders against the Company s need and usage of reinvested funds, and, if the Company uses newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan at a time when the shares are trading at a price below NAV, the stockholders receipt of fewer shares than they would have if the Company had effectuated open market purchases. The number of newly issued shares to be issued to a participant would be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of the Company s common stock at the close of regular trading on a national securities exchange on the dividend payment date. Shares purchased in open market transactions by Equiniti, the plan administrator and the Company s transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent, will be allocated to a participant based upon the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of the Company s common stock purchased with respect to the dividend. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying Equiniti in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends or other distributions in cash and hold such shares in noncertificated form. There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan administrator s fees will be paid by the Company. Stockholders who receive dividends and other distributions in the form of stock are generally subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. However, since a participating stockholder s cash dividends will be reinvested, such stockholder will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on reinvested dividends. A stockholder s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend or other distribution from the Company will generally be equal to the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend or other distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder s account. Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by so notifying the plan administrator by submitting a letter of instruction terminating the participant s account under the plan to Equiniti. The plan may be terminated by the Company upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by the Company. If participants withdraw from the plan or the plan is terminated, the plan administrator will cause the shares held for the participant under the plan to be delivered to the participant. If an investor holds common stock with a brokerage firm that does not participate in the plan, such investor will not be able to participate in the plan and any dividend reinvestment may be affected on different terms than those described above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued shares of its common stock pursuant to the Company dividend reinvestment plan. Open Market Share Repurchase Plan The Board authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock through an open-market share repurchase program for up to million in the aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock through 12 months from the date of the IPO. Pursuant to such authorization and concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan (the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan to acquire up to million in the aggregate of shares of its common stock, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.

 million and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company repurchased shares of its common stock pursuant to the Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan. PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan In addition, PSCM will purchase up to million in the aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock in the open market within one year of the IPO date if the Company s shares of common stock trade below a specific level of NAV per share following the IPO. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, PSCM entered into a share repurchase plan (the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan to permit the purchase of up to million shares of the Company s common stock. The purchases of shares pursuant to the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan will be implemented in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan is intended to allow PSCM to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan will require PSCM s agent to purchase shares of common stock on PSCM s behalf when the market price per share of the Company s common stock is trading below the most recently reported NAV per share of common stock. Under the PSCM Rule 10b-1 Stock Purchase Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of the Company s common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The purchase of shares pursuant to the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. The PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan commenced on March 23, 2024 and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12 months from the date of the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares purchased under the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan equals million, and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , PSCM did not repurchase any shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as otherwise specified, references to we, us, our, or the Company refer to Palmer Square Capital BDC Inc. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our company, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the liquidity of certain banks; 

uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and China, and the war between Russia and Ukraine; 

the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies; 

rising levels of inflation, and its impact on us, on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the ability of the Investment Advisor to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Investment Advisor and its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

risk associated with possible disruptions in our operations or the economy generally, including a possible slowdown in the economy and risk of recession; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of the companies in which we invest; 

the ability of the companies in which we invest to achieve their objectives; 

our ability to continue to effectively manage our business due to the disruptions caused by global political and economic instability; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we invest; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a BDC and as a RIC under the Code; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 

the adequacy, availability and pricing of our financing sources and working capital; 

actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Investment Advisor and its affiliates; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

loss of key personnel, and the illiquid nature of our investments; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements.

Overview 
 We are a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in corporate debt securities of companies, including small to large private U.S. companies. We were organized as a Maryland corporation on August 26, 2019 and are structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we expect to qualify as a RIC annually. 
 On January 22, 2024, we completed our IPO, issuing 5,450,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001, at a public offering price of 16.45 per share. Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PSBD on January 18, 2024. 
 We are externally managed by the Investment Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Subject to the supervision of our Board, a majority of which is made up of Independent Directors, our Investment Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services and certain administrative services. The Investment Advisor, in its capacity as Administrator, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator has entered into the Sub-Administration Agreement to delegate certain administrative functions to the Sub-Administrator. Our Investment Advisor is a majority-owned subsidiary of PSCM, which is a privately held firm specializing in global alternative (non-traditional) investments with a total return orientation. 
 Our investment objective is to maximize total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation. However, no assurance can be given that our investment objective will be achieved, and investment results may vary substantially on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The Company s current investment focus is guided by two strategies that facilitate our investment opportunities and core competencies: (1) investing in corporate debt securities and, to a lesser extent, (2) investing in CLO structured credit funds that typically own corporate debt securities, including the equity and junior debt tranches of CLOs. We seek to invest in credit and other assets that the Investment Advisor believes have strong structural protections, limited downside, and low long-term beta, or volatility, in comparison to systemic risk within the broader credit and equity markets. A significant portion of the loans in which we may invest or obtain exposure to through our investments in structured securities may be deemed Covenant-Lite Loans, which means the loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants compared to other loans and do not include terms which allow the lender to declare a default if certain covenants are breached. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments we hold and capital gains, if any, on investments. Our debt investments generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 47 

Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Investment Advisor under the Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead and rental expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 interest expense and other costs associated with our indebtedness; 

the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including our Investment Advisor s or its affiliates travel expenses, research costs and out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

operating costs incurred prior to the commencement of our operations; 

out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; 

U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 

Independent Directors fees and expenses; 

brokerage commissions and markups; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs, such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; and 

other expenses incurred by the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of overhead, including rental expenses. 

Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield to maturity of debt and income producing securities at fair value was 10.48 , and our weighted average total yield to maturity of debt and income producing securities at amortized cost was 9.41 . 
 As of December 31, 2023, our weighted average total yield to maturity of debt and income producing securities at fair value was 10.51 , and our weighted average total yield to maturity of debt and income producing securities at amortized cost was 8.93 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 258 debt and equity investments in 212 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately 1.3 billion. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 227 debt and equity investments in 191 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately 1.0 billion. 
 Our investment activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated).

(1) New CLO equity investments do not have an ascribed interest rate and are therefore excluded from the calculation. 

(2) Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to either a) LIBOR (which can include one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR) or b) the CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or S (which can include one-, three-, or six-month SOFR), which resets periodically based on the terms of the loan agreement. At the borrower s option, loans may instead reference an alternate base rate (which can include the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Prime Rate), which also resets periodically based on the terms of the loan agreements. Loans that reference SOFR may include a Credit Spread Adjustment CSA ), where the CSA is a defined additional spread amount based on the tenor of SOFR the borrower selects (making the reference rate S+CSA).

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total investment income was driven by increasing interest income due to the size of the portfolio. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from 966.9 million as of December 31, 2022 to 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. All debt and short-term investments were income producing, except for two loans on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, loans on non-accrual status represented 0.26 of the total investments at fair value (or 0.64 at amortized cost). There were no loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2023.

Net expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 60.8 million, which consisted of 43.8 million in interest expense, 7.3 million in management fees, 6.4 million in incentive fees, 3.2 million in other operating expenses, and 112 thousand in directors fees offset by 51 thousand in management fee waiver from the Investment Advisor. 
 Net expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 14.0 million, which consisted of 11.5 million in interest expense, 2.2 million in management fees, 527 thousand in other operating expenses, and 19 thousand in directors fees offset by 275 thousand in management fee waiver from the Investment Advisor.

 The increase in expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the average balance of debt increasing from 628.2 million at September 30, 2023 to 793.4 million at September 30, 2024 (interest rates increased slightly from 6.95 to 6.96 during the same period) under our BoA Credit Facility, WF Credit Facility and CLO Transaction and incentive fees due to the Investment Advisor upon completion of the IPO. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We anticipate cash to be generated from registered offerings of our common stock and other future offerings of equity and debt securities (including on-balance sheet CLO financings), and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted. Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we may be required to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings, our lenders, including under the BoA Credit Facility and the WF Credit Facility, may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls. In addition, such lenders may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 331 thousand. During the period, net cash used in operating activities was 234.9 million, primarily as a result of fundings of portfolio investments (excluding investments in short-term investments) of 602.0 million, partially offset by proceeds received from sale of investments of 292.4 million. We funded short-term investments during the period, and as of the end of the period we held 45.3 million in fair value of short-term investments. During the same period, net cash provided by financing activities was 234.6 million, primarily consisting of 300.0 million in proceeds from the CLO Transaction (as defined below), offset by 119.5 million of net repayments under the BoA Credit Facility and WF Credit Facility and distributions paid in cash of 31.3 million, partially increased by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 89.7 million. 
 52 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1.8 million. During the period, net cash provided by operating activities was 16.1 million, primarily as a result of proceeds received from sale of investments of 194.4 million, partially offset by fundings of portfolio investments (excluding investments in short-term investments) of 188.4 million. We funded short-term investments during the period, and as of the end of the period we held 99.5 million in fair value of short-term investments. During the same period, net cash used in financing activities was 14.4 million, primarily consisting of 12.0 million of net repayments under the BoA Credit Facility and WF Credit Facility and distributions paid in cash of 20.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 17.7 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 376.6 million principal outstanding under the BoA Credit Facility, 144.1 million principal outstanding under the WF Credit Facility and 300.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the CLO Transaction. As of September 30, 2023, we had 495.0 million principal outstanding under the BoA Credit Facility and 134.3 million principal outstanding under the WF Credit Facility. 
 
 As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future, of at least 150 . If this ratio declines below 150 , we cannot incur additional debt and could be required to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 166 . 
 Capital Contributions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we issued and sold 5,551,372 shares at an aggregate purchase price of 91.3 million and 2,379,185 shares at an aggregate purchase price of 39.3 million, respectively. These amounts include shares issued in reinvestment. 
 Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, we have entered into a share repurchase plan (the Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to acquire up to 15 million in the aggregate of shares of our common stock, if the market price per share of our common stock is below the most recently reported NAV per share, subject to certain limitations. Under the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan commenced on March 23, 2024 and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12 months from the date of the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares purchased under the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan equals 15 million and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 30,664 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan. 
 PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan 
 In addition, PSCM will purchase up to 5 million in the aggregate of shares of our common stock in the open market within one year of the IPO date if shares of our common stock trade below a specific level of NAV per share following the IPO. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, PSCM entered into a share repurchase plan (the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan to permit the purchase of up to 2.5 million shares of our common stock, if the market price per share of our common stock is below the most recently reported NAV per share, subject to certain limitations. The PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan commenced on March 23, 2024 and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12 months from the date of the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares purchased under the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan equals 2.5 million, and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PSCM did not repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan.

Financing Arrangements 
 Bank of America Credit Facility 
 On February 18, 2020, we, through a special purpose wholly-owned subsidiary, PS BDC Funding, entered into the Credit Agreement with the Lenders, BofA N.A. as the administrative agent and BofA Securities, as Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager, pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to provide us with a revolving line of credit. 
 Under the BoA Credit Facility, the Lenders have agreed to extend credit to PS BDC Funding in an aggregate amount up to the Commitment (as defined in the Credit Agreement) amount. The Commitment amount for the BoA Credit Facility is currently 525 million. The Borrowers ability to draw under the BoA Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on February 11, 2028. All amounts outstanding under the BoA Credit Facility are required to be repaid by February 18, 2028. On March 29, 2024, we entered into a fourth amendment to the BoA Credit Facility to, among other things: (i) extend the facility maturity date from February 18, 2025 to February 18, 2028; (ii) update arrangements for the calculation of the fee on unused commitments from 1.30 to a range from 0.50 to 1.40 , depending on the amount of commitments utilized, and (iii) payment of an extension fee. 
 Prior to February 3, 2023, the loans under the BOA Credit Facility may have been base rate loans or euro currency loans. The base rate loans bore interest at the base rate plus 1.30 , and the eurocurrency rate loans bore interest at 1-month or 3-month LIBOR plus 1.30 . The base rate was equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate, and (c) 1-month or 3-month LIBOR. On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into an omnibus amendment to the BoA Credit Facility that, among other things: (i) removed LIBOR transition language and (ii) replaced eurocurrency rate loans with SOFR loans. 
 As of February 3, 2023, the loans under the BoA Credit Facility may be base rate loans or SOFR loans. The base rate loans will bear interest at the base rate plus 1.40 , and the SOFR loans will bear interest at 1-month SOFR plus 1.40 or 3-month SOFR plus 1.45 . The base rate will be equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate, and (c) 1-month or 3-month SOFR plus 0.10 . The Credit Agreement includes fallback language in the event that SOFR becomes unavailable. Interest pursuant to base rate loans is payable quarterly in arrears, and interest pursuant to SOFR loans is payable either quarterly or monthly, as specified by the Borrowers in a loan notice pertaining thereto. The Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee of 0.50 for unused Commitments until the four-month anniversary of the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Thereafter, the commitment fee is 0.50 on unused Commitments up to 30 of the BoA Credit Facility, and 1.30 on unused Commitments in excess of 30 of the BoA Credit Facility. Such fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The advance rate for PS BDC Funding s Eligible Collateral Assets ranges from 40 for Second Lien Bank Loans to 70 for First Lien Bank Loans that are B Assets to 100 for Cash (excluding Excluded Amounts) (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement). 
 PS BDC Funding has pledged all of its assets to BofA N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent, to secure its obligations under the BoA Credit Facility. Both the Company and PS BDC Funding have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements, and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Borrowing under the BoA Credit Facility is subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act and PS BDC Funding complies with 1940 Act provisions relating to affiliated transactions and custody (Section 17, as modified by Section 57, of the 1940 Act). The custodian of the assets pledged to BofA N.A. pursuant to the BoA Credit Facility is U.S. Bank. The obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, including in the event of a change of control of PS BDC Funding or if the Investment Advisor ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 376.6 million principal outstanding and 148.4 million of available Commitments under the BoA Credit Facility, and PS BDC Funding was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the BoA Credit Facility on such date. 
 Wells Fargo Credit Facility 
 On December 18, 2020, we, through a special purpose wholly-owned subsidiary, PS BDC Funding II, entered into the Loan Agreement with the WF Lenders, WFB as the administrative agent and U.S. Bank, as Collateral Agent and Custodian, pursuant to which the WF Lenders agreed to provide us with a line of credit. 
 On December 18, 2023, we entered into the WF Credit Facility Fourth Amendment, which amends the WF Credit Facility to, among other things: (i) increase the amount available for borrowing under the WF Credit Facility from 150,000,000 to 175,000,000, (ii) extend the facility maturity date from December 18, 2025 to December 18, 2028 and (iii) extend the reinvestment period from December 18, 2023 to December 18, 2026 (subject to other provisions of the WF Credit Facility). 
 Prior to April 10, 2023, the loans under the WF Credit Facility may have been Broadly Syndicated Loans or Middle Market loans and were eurocurrency rate loans unless such rate was unavailable, in which case the loans were base rate loans until such rate was available. Broadly Syndicated Loans bore interest at the LIBOR or base rate, as applicable, plus 1.85 , and Middle Market Loans bore interest at LIBOR or base rate, as applicable, plus 2.35 . The base rate was equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 and (b) the prime rate. On April 10, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the WF Credit Facility that, among other things: (i) transferred and assigned U.S. Bank National Association s rights and obligations as collateral agent and as a secured party to U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, (ii) referenced SOFR instead of LIBOR and (iii) removed LIBOR transition language. 
 54 

As of April 10, 2023, the loans under the WF Credit Facility may be Broadly Syndicated Loans or Middle Market Loans and will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR or base rate (to the extent Daily Simple SOFR is unavailable), plus 2.50 , with an interest rate floor of 0.0 . The base rate will be equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 and (b) the prime rate. The Loan Agreement includes fallback language in the event that Daily Simple SOFR becomes unavailable. Interest is payable quarterly, as determined by the WFB as the administrative agent. Following an amendment to the WF Credit Facility on October 13, 2021, the Loan Agreement requires the payment of a non-usage fee of (x) during the first thirteen months following the closing of the WF Credit Facility, 0.50 multiplied by daily unused Facility Amounts, (y) between thirteen and sixteen months following the closing of the WF Credit Facility, 0.50 multiplied by the lesser of (1) daily unused Facility Amounts and (2) 50 of the Facility Amount plus 2.00 multiplied by the greater of (i) the difference between the daily unused Facility Amount and 50 of the Facility Amount and (ii) zero, and, (z) thereafter, 0.50 multiplied by the lesser of (1) daily unused Facility Amounts and (2) 20 of the Facility Amount plus 2.00 multiplied by the greater of (i) the difference between the daily unused Facility Amount and 20 of the Facility Amount and (ii) zero. Such fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The WF Credit Facility includes the option to downsize the facility by paying a Commitment Reduction Fee. The Fee is equal to 2.00 of the facility reduction amount prior to the one-year anniversary of the WF Credit Facility Fourth Amendment, and 1.00 thereafter. The applicable percentage for the advance rate on PS BDC Funding II s Eligible Loans ranges from 67.5 for Middle Market Loans to 70 for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as each such term is defined in the Loan Agreement). 
 PS BDC Funding II has pledged all of its assets to U.S. Bank, in its capacity as Collateral Agent, to secure its obligations under the WF Credit Facility and U.S. Bank acts as the custodian of such assets. Both the Company and PS BDC Funding II have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements, and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Borrowing under the WF Credit Facility is subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act and PS BDC Funding II complies with 1940 Act provisions relating to affiliated transactions and custody (Section 17, as modified by Section 57, of the 1940 Act). The obligations under the Loan Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, including in the event of a change of control of PS BDC Funding II, if the Investment Advisor ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Company, or if PSCM or its affiliates cease to directly or indirectly own a majority of the membership interests of the Investment Advisor. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 144.1 million outstanding and 30.9 million of available Commitments under the WF Credit Facility, and PS BDC Funding II was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the WF Credit Facility on such date. 
 CLO Transaction 
 On May 23, 2024, we completed a 400.5 million term debt securitization (the CLO Transaction ), also known as a collateralized loan obligation CLO ), in connection with which our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary issued the Notes (as defined below). The CLO Transaction functions as a source of long-term balance sheet financing for a portion of our portfolio investments and, as a result, the Notes issued in connection with the CLO Transaction are subject to our regulatory asset coverage requirement. 
 The notes offered in the CLO Transaction were issued by Palmer Square BDC CLO 1, Ltd. (the Issuer ), an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and our wholly-owned subsidiary, and consist of (i) 232 million of Class A Notes (the Class A Notes (ii) 58 million of Class B-1 Notes, (the Class B-1 Notes and (iii) 10 million of Class B-2 Notes (the Class B-2 Notes and, together with the Class A Notes and the Class B-1 Notes, the Secured Notes ). Additionally, the Issuer issued 100.5 million of Subordinated Notes (the Subordinated Notes ), which do not bear interest but are entitled to all of the principal and interest payments made on the loan portfolio held by the Issuer, net of interest and principal payments distributed to the holders of the Secured Notes. The Secured Notes together with the Subordinated Notes are collectively referred to herein as the Notes. 
 The CLO Transaction is backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured loans or participation interests therein with the potential for investment in second lien loans or participation interests therein, corporate bonds or loans made to a debtor-in-possession pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code having the priority allowed by either Section 364(c) or 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code and fully secured by senior liens or participation interests therein, which is managed by us as collateral manager pursuant to a collateral management agreement entered into with the Issuer (the Collateral Management Agreement ). We have agreed to irrevocably waive all collateral management fees payable to us so long as we are the collateral manager under the Collateral Management Agreement. The Notes are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2037; however, the Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer, at the written direction of (i) a majority of the Subordinated Notes (with the consent of us, in the case of the Secured Notes) or (ii) us, in each case, on any business day on or after July 15, 2026. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding indebtedness under the CLO Transaction of 300.0 million.

Distribution Policy 
 To the extent that we have income available, we intend to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board. Any dividends to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to operate in a manner so as to continuously qualify, as a RIC under the Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, among other things, we must distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each taxable year of an amount at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses investment company taxable income ), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend to distribute dividends to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses capital gain net income ), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of the stockholders are treated as taxable dividends. The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20 of the total distribution. Under this guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this guidance that are payable in part in stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, shares of our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the value of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. 
 For these excise tax purposes, we will be deemed to have distributed any net ordinary taxable income or capital gain net income on which we have paid U.S. federal income tax. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a calendar year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following calendar year, and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax. We may not be able to achieve results that will permit the payment of cash distributions. 
 We currently intend to distribute net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, we may decide in the future to retain such capital gains for investment, incur a corporate-level tax on such capital gains, and elect to treat such capital gains as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If this happens, our stockholders will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if they had received an actual distribution of the capital gains that we retain and reinvested the net after tax proceeds in us. In this situation, our stockholders would be eligible to claim a tax credit equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions, and if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so would cause us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if such distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings. 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that will provide for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who do not opt out of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. 
 Prior to the IPO, the Board primarily used newly-issued shares of our common stock to implement the dividend reinvestment plan. The number of shares of common stock to be issued to a participant prior to the IPO would be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the cash value of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the NAV per share as of the date such dividend was declared. 
 After the IPO, the Board intends to primarily use newly-issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, whether or not the shares are trading at a price per share at, below or above NAV. However, the Board reserves the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of the dividend reinvestment plan. The Board will examine the full facts and circumstances of each such dividend to determine the approach (i.e., to use newly issued shares or effectuate open market purchases to implement the dividend reinvestment plan) that is in the best interests of stockholders taking into account the Board s fiduciary duties to stockholders, including by weighing the potential dilution in connection with such issuance to be incurred by our stockholders against our need and usage of reinvested funds, and, if we use newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan at a time when the shares are trading at a price below NAV, the stockholders receipt of fewer shares than they would have if we had effectuated open market purchases. The number of newly issued shares to be issued to a participant would be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on a national securities exchange on the dividend payment date. Shares purchased in open market transactions by Equiniti, the plan administrator and our transfer agent, registrar, and dividend disbursing agent, will be allocated to a participant based upon the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of our common stock purchased with respect to the dividend. 
 A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying Equiniti in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends or other distributions in cash and hold such shares in noncertificated form.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. The preparation of these financial statements will require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we have described our critical accounting estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 In December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which permits a BDC s board of directors to either (i) choose to continue to determine fair value in good faith, or (ii) designate its investment adviser as the valuation designee tasked with determining fair value in good faith, subject to the board s oversight. Our Board has designated the Investment Advisor to serve as our valuation designee effective August 11, 2022. 
 Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Assets listed on an exchange will be valued at their last sales prices as reported to the consolidated quotation service at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on the date of determination. If no such sales of such securities occurred, such securities will be valued at the mean between the last available bid and ask prices as reported by an independent, third-party pricing service on the date of determination (unless the prices provided by the pricing service is believed by the Investment Advisor to be unreliable or a significant event has occurred subsequent to the provision of the prices that the Investment Advisor determines will affect the fair value of the securities). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (or for which either of the events noted in the parenthetical immediately above occur) are valued at fair value by the Investment Advisor. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates, although we will also engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that constitutes a material portion of our portfolio and that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once annually. With respect to unquoted securities, our Investment Advisor will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. With respect to Level 3 assets, we intend to retain one or more independent providers of financial advisory services to assist the Investment Advisor by performing certain limited third-party valuation services. We may appoint additional or different third-party valuation firms in the future. 
 When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs with respect to a fair-valued portfolio company or comparable company, the Investment Advisor will use the pricing indicated by the external event in connection with its fair valuation determination process. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Advisor using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had readily available market quotations existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of securities are determined using the identified cost basis method for financial reporting. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor and the Administration Agreement with the Investment Advisor (in such capacity, the Administrator). Mr. Christopher D. Long and Mr. Jeffrey D. Fox, each an executive officer of ours and an interested member of our Board, and Angie K. Long, Matthew L. Bloomfield and Scott A. Betz, each an executive officer of ours, have an indirect pecuniary interest in the Investment Advisor. The Investment Advisor is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act that is majority-owned by PSCM. See Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor in accordance with the 1940 Act. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (a) a base management fee calculated at an annual rate of 1.75 of the average value of the weighted average of our total net assets at the end of the two most recently completed quarters and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The Investment Advisor agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of 1.75 of the total net assets during any period prior to the IPO. We have entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator to serve as our administrator. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us with clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities, and provides us with other services necessary for us to operate or has engaged a third-party firm to perform some or all of these functions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not recorded on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. Unfunded commitments may expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had twenty-two unfunded commitments totaling 19.6 million and fifteen unfunded commitments totaling 20.1 million, respectively. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for specific identification of the unfunded commitments. We believe we maintain sufficient liquidity in the form of cash (including restricted cash, if any), receivables and borrowing capacity to fund these unfunded commitments should the need arise. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources above. 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 58 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qua litative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Assuming that the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rate.

The data in the table are based on our current statements of assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 17.5 million in net purchases that had not yet settled and 19.6 million in unfunded commitments. After settlement of these purchases, the change in interest expense will be larger as a result of the increase in the amount borrowed under the BoA Credit Facility, WF Credit Facility or CLO Transaction, as applicable. The table does not include any change in dividend income from our money market investments. 
 In addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls, and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 
 We measure exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on an ongoing basis and may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts and credit hedging contracts, such as credit default swaps, in each case, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 59 

PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. 

We are subject to risks associated with forming CLOs. 
 To finance investments, we have in the past and may in the future securitize certain of our secured loans or other investments, including through the formation of one or more CLOs, such as the CLO Transaction, while retaining all or most of the subordinated notes issued in the securitization. This involves contributing a pool of assets to a special purpose entity, and selling debt interests in such entity on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to purchasers. 
 In connection with the CLO Transaction (and any other CLO we may form in the future), we depend (or will depend) in part on distributions from the CLO s assets out of its earnings and cash flows to enable us to make distributions to shareholders. The ability of a CLO to make distributions will be, and in connection with the CLO Transaction is, subject to various limitations, including the terms and covenants of the debt it issues. The Subordinated Notes issued by the Issuer and retained by us are the most junior class of notes issued by the Issuer, are subordinated in priority of payment to the other Notes issued by the Issuer and are subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the indenture governing the Notes issued by Issuer. Therefore, we only receive cash distributions on the Subordinated Notes if the Issuer has made all cash interest payments to all other Notes it has issued. 
 Also, a CLO may take actions to retain cash or other assets to satisfy asset coverage requirements or other tests commonly provided for holders of the CLO s debt, which could impact our ability to receive distributions from the CLO. With respect to the CLO Transaction, if the Issuer does not meet the asset coverage tests or the interest coverage test set forth in the documents governing the CLO Transaction, cash would be diverted from the Subordinated Notes that we hold to first pay the more senior Notes issued by the Issuer in amounts sufficient to cause such tests to be satisfied. If we do not receive cash flow from any such CLO, including in connection with the CLO Transaction, that is necessary to satisfy the annual distribution requirement for maintaining RIC status, and we are unable to obtain cash from other sources necessary to satisfy this requirement, we may not maintain our qualification as a RIC, which would have a material adverse effect on an investment in the shares. 
 In addition, a decline in the credit quality of loans in a CLO due to poor operating results of the relevant borrower or increases in defaults, among other things, may result in a reduction of earnings and, in turn, cash potentially available for distribution to us for distribution to shareholders. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the CLO in respect of any collateral, including, with respect to the CLO Transaction, the value of the portfolio of loan investments held by the Issuer, such losses will be borne first by us as owner of equity interests in the CLO and, in the case of the CLO Transaction, the value of the Subordinated Notes that we have retained could be reduced at their redemption and could not be paid in full or at all.

(1) Concurrently with the closing of the IPO on January 22, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to enter into the Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to acquire up to 15 million in the aggregate of shares of our common stock, if the market price per share of our common stock is below the most recently reported NAV per share, subject to certain limitations. Under the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The Company Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan commenced on March 23, 2024 and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12 months from the date of the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan, (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares purchased under the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan equals 15 million and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company Rule 10b5-1 Stock Repurchase Plan. 

PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan 
 Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, PSCM entered into the PSCM Rule 10b5-1 Stock Purchase Plan to permit the purchase of up to 2.5 million shares of our common stock, if the market price per share of our common stock is below the most recently reported NAV per share, subject to certain limitations.
