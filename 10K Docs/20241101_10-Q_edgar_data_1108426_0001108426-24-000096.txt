Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company defines utility margin as electric operating revenues less cost of energy. Cost of energy consists primarily of fuel and purchase power costs for PNM and costs charged by third-party transmission providers for TNMP. The Company believes that utility margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating operations than electric operating revenues since substantially all such costs are offset in revenues as fuel and purchase power costs are passed through to customers under PNM s FPPAC and third-party transmission costs are passed on to consumers through TNMP s transmission cost recovery factor. Utility margin is not a financial measure required to be presented and is considered a non-GAAP measure.

 regulated utilities providing electricity and electric services in New Mexico and Texas. TXNM s electric utilities are PNM and TNMP. Additional information concerning electric operating revenue is contained in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Accounts receivable consists primarily of trade receivables from customers. In the normal course of business, credit is extended to customers on a short-term basis. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables based on historical experience and estimated default rates. Accounts receivable balances are reviewed monthly, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made as necessary and amounts that are deemed uncollectible are written off. In addition to the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables, the Company has evaluated other receivables for potential credit related losses. These balances include potential exposures for other non-retail utility services. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were estimated credit losses related to these transactions. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 
 Performance obligations related to contracts with customers are typically satisfied when the energy is delivered and the customer or end-user utilizes the energy. Accounts receivable from customers represent amounts billed, including amounts under ARPs. For PNM, accounts receivable reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of allowance for credit losses, includes million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 resulting from contracts with customers. All of TNMP s accounts receivable results from contracts with customers.

million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. This contract asset is presented in Other deferred charges on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Contract liabilities arise when consideration is received in advance from a customer before satisfying the performance obligations. Therefore, revenue is deferred and not recognized until the obligation is satisfied. Other utilities pay PNM and TNMP in advance for the joint-use of their utility poles. These revenues are recognized over the period of time specified in the joint-use contract, typically for one calendar year. Deferred revenues on these arrangements are recorded as contract liabilities. TXNM s, PNM s, and TNMP s contract liabilities and related revenues are not material for any of the periods presented. The Company has no other arrangements with remaining performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price would be required to be allocated.

 million and million for fixed charges and million and million for variable charges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, PNM paid million and million for fixed charges and million and million for variable charges. PNM does not have any other financial obligations related to Valencia. The assets of Valencia can only be used to satisfy its obligations and creditors of Valencia do not have any recourse against PNM s assets. During the term of the PPA, PNM has the option, under certain conditions, to purchase and own up to of the plant or the VIE. The PPA specifies that the purchase price would be the greater of of book value reduced by related indebtedness or of fair market value. 
 
 PNM sources fuel for the plant, controls when the facility operates through its dispatch, and receives the entire output of the plant, which factors directly and significantly impact the economic performance of Valencia. Therefore, PNM has concluded that the third-party entity that owns Valencia is a VIE and that PNM is the primary beneficiary of the entity since PNM has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Valencia and will absorb the majority of the variability in the cash flows of the plant. As the primary beneficiary, PNM consolidates Valencia in its financial statements. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities, operating expenses, and cash flows of Valencia are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of PNM although PNM has no legal ownership interest or voting control of the VIE. The assets and liabilities of Valencia are set forth below and are not shown separately on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The owner s equity and net income of Valencia are considered attributable to non-controlling interest.

Westmoreland San Juan Mining, LLC 
 
 As discussed in the subheading Coal Supply in Note 11, PNM and Westmoreland San Juan Mining, LLC WSJ LLC ), a subsidiary of Westmoreland Mining Holdings, LLC have agreements under which CCR disposal and mine reclamation services for SJGS will be provided. 
 
 TXNM issued million in letters of credit to facilitate the issuance of reclamation bonds. The letters of credit support results in TXNM having a variable interest in WSJ LLC since TXNM is subject to possible loss in the event performance by TXNM is required under the letters of credit support. TXNM considers the possibility of loss under the letters of credit support to be remote since the purpose of posting the bonds is to provide assurance that WSJ LLC performs the required reclamation of the mine site in accordance with applicable regulations and the reclamation services agreement provides WSJ LLC the ability to recover the cost of reclamation. Additionally, much of the mine reclamation activities have been and will continue to be performed after the SJGS CSA expired on September 30, 2022. As discussed in Note 11, each of the SJGS participants has established and actively fund trusts to meet future reclamation obligations.

 PNM s operations are managed primarily through a net asset-backed strategy, whereby PNM s aggregate net open forward contract position is covered by its forecasted excess generation capabilities or market purchases. PNM could be exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were to be disrupted or if its load requirements were to be greater than anticipated. If all or a portion of load requirements were required to be covered as a result of such unexpected situations, commitments would have to be met through market purchases.

 Other current liabilities Net 
 
 Certain of PNM s commodity derivative instruments in the above table are subject to master netting agreements whereby assets and liabilities could be offset in the settlement process. PNM does not offset fair value and cash collateral for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements and the above table reflects the gross amounts of fair value assets and liabilities for commodity derivatives. 
 
 As discussed above, PNM has NMPRC-approved guidelines for hedging arrangements to manage fuel and purchased power costs related to customers covered by its FPPAC. The table above includes other current assets or other current liabilities related to these arrangements at September 30, 2024 and million of other current assets and of other current liabilities at December 31, 2023 with changes in fair value recorded as Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PNM had amounts recognized for the legal right to reclaim cash collateral. However, amounts posted as cash collateral under margin arrangements were million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. These amounts are included in other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, obligations to return cash collateral were million, which is included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The changes in the fair value of commodity derivative instruments that are considered economic hedges had no impact on PNM s net earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Commodity derivatives had no impact on OCI for any of the periods presented.

 In connection with managing its commodity risks, PNM enters into master agreements with certain counterparties. If PNM is in a net liability position under an agreement, some agreements provide that the counterparties can request collateral if PNM s credit rating is downgraded; other agreements provide that the counterparty may request collateral to provide it with adequate assurance that PNM will perform; and others have no provision for collateral. 
 
 The table below presents information about PNM s contingent requirements to provide collateral under certain commodity contracts having an objectively determinable collateral provision, that are in net liability positions, and that are not fully collateralized with cash. Contractual liability represents those commodity derivative contracts recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, determined on an individual contract basis without offsetting amounts for individual contracts that are in an asset position and could be offset under master netting agreements with the same counterparty. Cash collateral posted under these contracts does not reflect letters of credit under the Company s revolving credit facilities that may have been issued as collateral. Net exposure is the net contractual liability for all contracts, including those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, offset by existing collateral and by any offsets available under master netting agreements, including both assets and liability positions. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PNM had contractual liability, posted cash collateral, and such contracts in a net liability position. 
 
 Non-Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 The carrying amounts reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value for cash, receivables, and payables due to the short period of maturity. Investment securities are carried at fair value. Investment securities consist of PNM assets held in the NDT for its share of decommissioning costs of PVNGS, a trust for PNM s share of decommissioning costs at SJGS, and trusts for PNM s share of final reclamation costs related to the coal mines serving SJGS and Four Corners. See Note 11. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of investment securities included million and million for the NDT, million and million for the SJGS decommissioning trust, and million and million for the coal mine reclamation trusts. 
 
 PNM records a realized loss as an impairment for any available-for-sale debt security that has a fair value that is less than its carrying value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PNM had no available-for-sale debt securities for which carrying value exceeded fair value, where the impairments were considered to be other than temporary and included in AOCI rather than recognized in earnings. All gains and losses resulting from sales and changes in the fair value of equity securities are recognized immediately in earnings.

Fair Value Disclosures 
 
 The Company determines the fair values of its derivative and other financial instruments based on the hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
 For investment securities, Level 2 fair values are provided by fund managers utilizing a pricing service. For Level 2 fair values, the pricing provider predominantly uses the market approach using bid side market values based upon a hierarchy of information for specific securities or securities with similar characteristics. Fair values of Level 2 investments in mutual funds are equal to net asset value NAV ). For commodity derivatives, Level 2 fair values are determined based on market observable inputs, which are validated using multiple broker quotes, including forward price, volatility, and interest rate curves to establish expectations of future prices. Credit valuation adjustments are made for estimated credit losses based on the overall exposure to each counterparty. For the Company s long-term debt, Level 2 fair values are provided by an external pricing service. The pricing service primarily utilizes quoted prices for similar debt in active markets when determining fair value. Management of the Company independently verifies the information provided by pricing services. Uncategorized investments include common/collective investment trusts, which are measured at NAV at the end of each reporting period. Audited financial statements are received for each fund and reviewed by the Company annually. Fair value for these collective investment trusts is measured using a practical expedient provided under GAAP that allows the NAV per share to be used as fair value for investments in certain entities that do not have readily determinable fair values and are considered to be investment companies. Investments valued using this practical expedient are not required to be presented within the GAAP fair value hierarchy.

 , overlapping performance period. Performance stock awards with performance periods ending before 2024 or after 2025 are subject to achieving both performance and market targets. Performance stock awards with performance periods ending from 2024 through 2025 do not include market targets. Other awards of restricted stock are only subject to time-based vesting requirements. Additional information concerning stock-based compensation under the PEP is contained in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 Restricted stock under the PEP refers to awards of stock subject to vesting, performance, or market conditions rather than to shares with contractual post-vesting restrictions. Generally, the awards vest ratably over from the grant date of the award. However, awards with performance or market conditions vest upon satisfaction of those conditions. In addition, plan provisions provide that upon retirement, participants become vested in certain stock awards. The vesting period for awards of restricted stock to non-employee members of the Board is . 
 
 The stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards without performance or market conditions to participants that are retirement eligible on the grant date is recognized immediately at the grant date and is not amortized. Compensation expense for other such awards is amortized over the shorter of the requisite vesting period or the period until the participant becomes retirement eligible. Compensation expense for performance-based shares is recognized ratably over the performance period as required service is provided and is adjusted periodically to reflect the level of achievement expected to be attained. Compensation expense related to market-based shares is recognized ratably over the measurement period, regardless of the actual level of achievement, provided the employees meet their service requirements. At September 30, 2024, TXNM had unrecognized expense related to stock awards of million, which is expected to be recognized over an average of years. 
 
 The grant date fair value for restricted stock and stock awards with internal TXNM performance targets is determined based on the market price of TXNM common stock on the date of the agreements reduced by the present value of future dividends that will not be received prior to vesting. The grant date fair value is applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to vest, although the number of performance shares that ultimately vest cannot be determined until after the performance periods end. The grant date fair value of stock awards with market targets were determined using Monte Carlo simulation models, which provide grant date fair values that include an expectation of the number of shares to vest at the end of the measurement period.

 Financing Activities 
 
 On May 6, 2024, TXNM entered into a distribution agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents and Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Royal Bank of Canada, The Bank of Nova Scotia, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as forward purchasers, pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales amount of million of its common stock, no par value, through the sales agents (the TXNM 2024 ATM Program ). On August 5, 2024, subsequent to approval by shareholders to increase TXNM s authorized shares, the Company amended the distribution agreement increasing the aggregate sales amount from million to million of its common stock, no par value, that may be sold under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program. 
 
 Sales of the shares made pursuant to the distribution agreement, if any, may be made in at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of TXNM s common stock, capital needs and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. TXNM did not receive any proceeds upon the execution of this agreement. The Company also may enter into forward stock purchase transactions, pursuant to the distribution agreement, in which forward purchasers may borrow from third parties and, through a sales agent acting as a forward seller, sell a number of shares equal to the number of shares of the Company s common stock to hedge the agreement. Although the Company expects to settle any forward stock purchase transaction with fully physical settlement, except in certain specified circumstances, TXNM has the option to elect physical, cash, or net share settlement of the forward stock purchase transactions. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of borrowed shares of common stock by a forward seller. The Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of shares directly by sales agents or upon future physical settlement(s) in connection with the forward stock purchase transactions, in which latter case the Company will expect to receive, subject to certain adjustments, aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the relevant forward agreements, multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, TXNM entered into a forward sale agreement with a forward purchaser for the sale of shares of common stock under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program (the Q2 2024 Forward Sale Agreement ).

 During the third quarter of 2024, TXNM entered into forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for the sale of shares of common stock under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program (the Q3 2024 Forward Sale Agreements , and together with the Q2 2024 Forward Sale Agreement, the 2024 Forward Sale Agreements ). The Q3 2024 Forward Sale Agreements have a weighted average initial forward sale price of per share that is subject to adjustments based on a net interest rate factor and by future dividends paid on TXNM common stock as specified in the forward sale agreement. 
 
 TXNM did not initially receive any proceeds upon the execution of these agreements and, except in certain specified circumstances, has the option to elect physical, cash, or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements on or before a date that is 12 months from the agreement effective date. As of September 30, 2024, no shares have been settled under the 2024 Forward Sale Agreements.

 The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will initially be 22.4911 shares of TXNM s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock. The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a conversion premium of above the last reported sale price of TXNM s common stock on June 4, 2024. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment by certain events such as increased dividends but will not adjust for any accrued or unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes or if TXNM delivers a notice of a special event redemption, TXNM will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event or such notice of special event redemption, as the case may be.

In the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture, TXNM may be required to repurchase, for cash, the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes plus accrued interest. TXNM may not redeem the Convertible notes prior to June 6, 2029 except upon the occurrence of a special event as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture.

 million (in 2023 dollars) for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at PVNGS for the remaining term of the operating licenses. PNM accrues these costs as a component of fuel expense as the nuclear fuel is consumed. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PNM had a liability for interim storage costs of million and million, which is included in other deferred credits. 
 
 PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation ISFSI to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027. Additionally, PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the U.S. government s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation. 
 
 The Energy Transition Act 
 
 In 2019, the Governor signed into New Mexico state law Senate Bill 489, known as the Energy Transition Act ETA ). The ETA became effective as of June 14, 2019 and sets a statewide standard that requires investor-owned electric utilities to have specified percentages of their electric-generating portfolios be from renewable and zero-carbon generating resources. The ETA requires utilities operating in New Mexico to have renewable portfolios equal to 40 by 2025, 50 by 2030, 80 by 2040, and 100 zero-carbon energy by 2045. The ETA also allows for the recovery of undepreciated investments and decommissioning costs related to qualifying EGUs that the NMPRC has required be removed from retail jurisdictional rates, provided replacement resources to be included in retail rates have lower or zero-carbon emissions. The ETA requires the NMPRC to review and approve utilities annual renewable portfolio plans to ensure compliance with the RPS. Also pursuant to the ETA, the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board adopted standards of performance that limit CO 2 emissions to no

 monitoring well contained free-phase hydrocarbon products. PNM collected a sample of the product for fingerprint analysis. The results of this analysis indicated the product was a mixture of older and newer fuels. The presence of newer fuels in the sample suggests the hydrocarbon product likely originated from off-site sources. In 2015, PNM and NMED entered into a memorandum of understanding to address changing groundwater conditions at the site under which PNM agreed to continue hydrocarbon investigation under the supervision of NMED. Qualified costs are eligible for payment through the New Mexico Corrective Action Fund CAF ), which is administered by the NMED Petroleum Storage Tank Bureau. In 2019, PNM received notice from NMED that an abatement plan for the site is required to address concentrations of previously identified compounds, unrelated to those discussed above, found in the groundwater. NMED approved PNM s abatement plan proposal, which covers field work and reporting. 
 
 Field work related to the investigation under both the CAF and abatement plan requirements was completed and activities and findings associated with the field work were presented in separate reports and released to stakeholders in early 2020. Subsequent field work was completed in July 2020 and reports were released supporting PNM s contention

 million, due primarily to higher inflationary factors. As a result, PNM recorded the increase in the liability related to the underground mine of million as a regulatory asset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the NMPRC cap on the amount that can be collected from retail customers for final reclamation of the surface mines at million, PNM was required to record million of the increase related to the surface mine liability plus an additional million, related to other costs, as a regulatory disallowance on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, PNM and Westmoreland amended the mine reclamation services agreement to update the base rates for the costs of reclamation activities, which resulted in an increase in overall reclamation costs of million. As a result, PNM recorded the increase in the liability related to the underground mine of million as regulatory assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the increase of million related to the surface mine as a regulatory disallowance on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 PNM s estimate of the costs necessary to reclaim the mine that serves SJGS is subject to many assumptions, including the timing of reclamation, generally accepted practices at the time reclamation activities occur, and current inflation and discount rates. PNM cannot predict the ultimate cost to reclaim the mine that serves SJGS and would seek to recover all costs related to reclaiming the underground mine from its customers but could be exposed to additional loss related to surface mine reclamation. In connection with certain mining permits relating to the operation of the San Juan mine, Westmoreland was required to post reclamation bonds of million with the NMMMD. In order to facilitate the posting of reclamation bonds by sureties on behalf of Westmoreland, TXNM entered into the WFB LOC Facility under which letters of credit aggregating million have been issued. 
 
 A coal mine reclamation study for the mine that serves Four Corners was issued in 2019. The study reflected operation of the mine through 2031, the term of the Four Corners CSA. 
 
 Based on the most recent estimates, PNM s remaining payments as of September 30, 2024 for mine reclamation, in future dollars, are estimated to be million for the surface mines at both SJGS and Four Corners and million for the underground mine at SJGS. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, liabilities, in current dollars, of million and million for surface mine reclamation and million and million for underground mine reclamation were recorded in other deferred credits. 
 
 The SJGS owners are parties to a reclamation trust funds agreement to provide financial assurance for post-term coal mine reclamation obligations. The trust funds agreement requires each owner to enter into an individual trust agreement with a financial institution as trustee, create an irrevocable reclamation trust, and meet year-end funding targets set by funding curves that are approved by the SJGS ownership. PNM began using its mine reclamation trust to pay for final mine reclamation costs in April 2023. Because the trust agreement requires meeting specific funding targets at year end, it may be necessary for PNM to make additional contributions to meet those targets. PNM funded million in 2023. The recently completed and approved mine reclamation cost study resulted in an update to the trust s funding curves. Based on PNM s reclamation trust

 million in 2024, million in 2025, and million in 2026. 
 
 Under the Four Corners CSA, PNM is required to fund its share of estimated final reclamation costs in annual installments into an irrevocable escrow account solely dedicated to the final reclamation cost of the surface mine at Four Corners. PNM contributed million in 2024 and million in 2023. PNM anticipates providing additional funding of million in 2025 and million in 2026. 
 
 PNM recovers from retail customers reclamation costs associated with the underground mine. However, the NMPRC capped the amount collected from retail customers for final reclamation of the surface mines at million for both SJGS and Four Corners. If future estimates increase the liability for surface mine reclamation, the excess would be expensed at that time. The impacts of changes in New Mexico state law as a result of the enactment of the ETA and regulatory determinations made by the NMPRC may also affect PNM s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. PNM is currently unable to determine the outcome of these matters or the range of possible impacts. 
 
 SJGS Decommissioning 
 
 On November 9, 2021, the San Juan County Commission approved the Coal-Fired Electricity Generating Facility Demolition and Remediation Ordinance Ordinance 121 ), requiring the full demolition of SJGS upon its complete and permanent closure. Ordinance 121 required the SJGS owners to submit a proposed demolition and remediation plan no later than three months after SJGS was retired. The SJGS owners submitted the decommissioning and remediation plan on December 28, 2022. In connection with restructuring of the SJGS ownership on December 31, 2017, PNM and the other SJGS owners entered into the San Juan Decommissioning and Trust Funds Agreement, which requires PNM to fund its ownership share of final decommissioning costs into an irrevocable trust. Under the agreement, PNM made an initial funding of million in December 2022. The amount and timing of additional trust funding is subject to revised decommissioning cost studies and agreement among the SJGS owners. PNM began using its decommissioning trust to pay for demolition and decommissioning costs in October 2023. PNM has posted a surety bond in the amount of million in connection with certain environmental decommissioning obligations and must maintain the bond or other financial assurance until those obligations are satisfied. The surety bond only represents a liability if the SJGS owners fail to deliver on its contractual liability. For information regarding the impact of Ordinance 121 on PNM s SJGS decommissioning ARO see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 PNM records its share of the SJGS decommissioning obligation as an ARO on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Studies on the decommissioning costs of SJGS are performed periodically and revisions to the ARO liability are recorded. In the third quarter of 2022, a new decommissioning cost study was completed, which required PNM to remeasure its SJGS decommissioning ARO. The new study resulted in an estimated decrease to PNM s share of the decommissioning obligation of million, which was recorded in September 2022. Additional information concerning the Company s SJGS decommissioning ARO is contained in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 PVNGS Liability and Insurance Matters 
 
 Public liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both commercial sources and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan. The insurance limit is subject to an adjustment every five years based upon the aggregate percentage change in the CPI. The most recent adjustment took effect on January 1, 2024. As of that date, in accordance with this act, the PVNGS participants are insured against public liability exposure for a nuclear incident up to billion per occurrence. PVNGS maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of million, which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers. The remaining billion is provided through a mandatory industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, PNM could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum retrospective premium per reactor under the program for each nuclear liability incident is million, subject to a maximum annual premium of million per incident. Based on PNM s ownership interest in the three Palo Verde units, PNM s maximum retrospective premium per incident for all three units is million, with a maximum annual payment limitation of million, to be adjusted periodically for inflation.

The primary policy offered by NEIL contains a sublimit of billion for non-nuclear property damage. If NEIL s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, PNM is subject to retrospective premium adjustments of million. The insurance coverages discussed in this and the previous paragraph are subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits, and exclusions.

 2024 Rate Change 
 
 On December 5, 2022, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for a general increase in retail electric rates including recovery on total rate base of billion based on a calendar year 2024 FTY, an increase of million in retail non-fuel revenues, and an ROE . The application also proposed ratemaking treatment of PVNGS Leased Interest and testimony supporting the prudence of PNM s decisions to renew the leases and repurchase MW of PVNGS Unit 2 capacity. 
 
 On January 3, 2024, the NMPRC issued a final order authorizing PNM to implement an increase in non-fuel base rates of million, effective for service beginning January 15, 2024. Major components of the difference compared to PNM s application include: 
 
 A ROE of . 
 A capital structure of equity, debt, and preferred stock.

 In the year ended December 31, 2023, PNM evaluated the outcome of the NMPRC final order in the 2024 Rate Change and recorded a regulatory disallowance of million on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and a corresponding reduction to Utility Plant, after accounting for previous impairments, to reflect the remedy adopted in the Final Order for Four Corners. In addition, PNM recorded a reduction to electric operating revenues of million with a corresponding current regulatory liability of million and a deferred regulatory liability of million for the PVNGS rate refunds that will be returned to customers over a period. PNM also recorded a regulatory disallowance of million on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and a corresponding reduction to Utility Plant for the disallowance of CWIP from PVNGS. 
 
 In March 2024, notice of appeals were separately filed with the NM Supreme Court by NEE and PNM, and a joint notice of appeal was filed by the NM Department of Justice, Bernalillo County, and ABCWUA. NEE s appeal was subsequently consolidated with the joint notice of appeal. In the statements of issues submitted in the parties appellate dockets, PNM took issue with the NMPRC s ruling on capital structure; other appellants primarily challenged the NMPRC rulings related to Four Corners and Palo Verde cost recovery. PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard 
 
 As discussed in Note 11, the ETA amends the REA including removal of diversity requirements and certain customer caps and exemptions relating to the application of the RPS under the REA. The REA provides for streamlined proceedings for approval of utilities renewable energy procurement plans, assures that utilities recover costs incurred consistent with approved procurement plans, and requires the NMPRC to establish a Reasonable Cost Threshold RCT for the procurement of renewable resources to prevent excessive costs being added to rates. The ETA sets a RCT of 60 per MWh, adjusted for inflation, using an average annual levelized resource cost basis. PNM makes renewable procurements consistent with the NMPRC approved plans and recovers certain renewable procurement costs from customers through the renewable energy rider billed on a KWh basis. 
 
 Included in PNM s approved procurement plans are the following renewable energy resources: 
 
 MW of PNM-owned solar-PV facilities 
 A PPA through 2044 for the output of New Mexico Wind, having a current aggregate capacity of MW, and a PPA through 2035 for the output of Red Mesa Wind, having an aggregate capacity of MW 
 A PPA through 2040 for MW of output from La Joya Wind II 
 A PPA through 2042 for the output of the Lightning Dock Geothermal facility with a capacity of MW 
 Solar distributed generation, aggregating MW at September 30, 2024, owned by customers or third parties from whom PNM purchases any net excess output and RECs 
 
 The NMPRC has authorized PNM to recover certain renewable procurement costs through a rate rider billed on a per KWh basis. In its 2024 renewable energy procurement plan, which became effective on January 1, 2024, PNM proposed to collect million for the year. PNM recorded revenues from the rider of million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On June 3, 2024, PNM filed its renewable energy procurement plan for 2025 which proposes to collect million for the year. PNM did not propose any new resource procurements, and the plan states that existing projects are anticipated to exceed the applicable RPS standards of 2025, despite the standard doubling. On September 11, 2024, a public hearing was held and on October 11, 2024, the hearing examiners issued a RD recommending approval of all PNM s requests.

 , PNM is required to refund the excess to customers during May through December of the following year. PNM did not exceed such limitation in 2023. 
 
 Energy Efficiency and Load Management 
 
 Program Costs and Incentives/Disincentives 
 
 The New Mexico Efficient Use of Energy Act EUEA requires public utilities to achieve specified levels of energy savings and to obtain NMPRC approval to implement energy efficiency and load management programs. The EUEA requires the NMPRC to remove utility disincentives to implementing energy efficiency and load management programs and to provide incentives for such programs. The NMPRC has adopted a rule to implement this act. PNM s costs to implement approved programs and incentives are recovered through a rate rider. During the 2019 New Mexico legislative session, the EUEA was amended to, among other things, include a decoupling mechanism for disincentives, preclude a reduction to a utility s ROE based on approval of disincentive or incentive mechanisms, establish energy savings targets for the period 2021 through 2025, and require that annual program funding be 3 to 5 of an electric utility s annual customer bills excluding gross receipt taxes, franchise and right-of-way access fees, provided that a customer s annual cost does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars. 
 
 On April 17, 2023, PNM filed an application for energy efficiency and load management programs to be offered in 2024, 2025, and 2026 (the 2024 Plan ). The 2024 Plan proposed to continue existing energy efficiency programs with modification and a total annual budget of million in 2024, million in 2025, and million in 2026. The application also sought approval of an annual base incentive of of the portfolio budget and a sliding scale that provides additional incentive for additional energy saved as a percentage of program cost, up to the maximum allowed by the energy efficiency rule which for PNM is . On January 26, 2024, the hearing examiners in the case issued a RD. The RD largely approved PNM s 2024 Plan but with modifications that include the pursuit of demand response resources, additional analysis in future filings, adjustments to certain energy efficiency programs, and modification of the incentive sliding scale cap to reflect a new maximum. On March 7, 2024, the NMPRC approved the RD in its entirety. 
 
 2020 Decoupling Petition 
 
 As discussed above, the legislature amended the EUEA to, among other things, include a decoupling mechanism for disincentives. On May 28, 2020, PNM filed a petition for approval of a rate adjustment mechanism that would decouple the rates of its residential and small power rate classes. Decoupling is a rate design principle that severs the link between the recovery of fixed costs of the utility through volumetric charges. On July 13, 2020, NEE, ABCWUA, the City of Albuquerque, and Bernalillo County filed motions to dismiss the petition on the grounds that approving PNM s proposed rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case would result in retroactive ratemaking and piecemeal ratemaking. The motions to dismiss also alleged that PNM s proposed rate adjustment mechanism is inconsistent with the EUEA. On October 2, 2020, PNM requested an order to vacate the public hearing, scheduled to begin October 13, 2020, and staying the proceeding until the NMPRC decides whether to entertain a petition to issue a declaratory order resolving the issues raised in the motions to dismiss. On October 7, 2020, the hearing examiner approved PNM s request to stay the proceeding and vacate the public hearing and required PNM to file a petition for declaratory order by October 30, 2020. On October 30, 2020, PNM filed a petition for declaratory order asking the NMPRC to issue an order finding that full revenue decoupling is authorized by the EUEA. On November 4, 2020, ABCWUA and Bernalillo County jointly filed a competing petition asking the NMPRC to issue a declaratory order on the EUEA s requirements related to disincentives. On March 17, 2021, the NMPRC issued an order granting the petitions for declaratory order, commencing a declaratory order proceeding to address the petitions and appointing a hearing examiner to preside over the declaratory order proceeding. 
 
 On January 14, 2022, the hearing examiner issued a RD recommending the NMPRC find that the EUEA does not mandate the NMPRC to authorize or approve a full decoupling mechanism, defining full decoupling as limited to energy efficiency and load management measures and programs. The RD also states that a utility may request approval of a rate adjustment mechanism to remove regulatory disincentives to energy efficiency and load management measures and programs through a stand-alone petition, as part of the utility s triennial energy efficiency application or a general rate case and that PNM is not otherwise precluded from petitioning for a rate adjustment mechanism prior to its next general rate case. Finally, the RD stated that the EUEA does not permit the NMPRC to reduce a utility s ROE based on approval of a disincentive removal mechanism founded on removing regulatory disincentives to energy efficiency and load management measures and programs. The RD does not specifically prohibit a downward adjustment to a utility s capital structure, based on approval of a disincentive removal mechanism. On April 27, 2022, the NMPRC issued an order adopting the RD in its entirety. On May 24, 2022, PNM filed a notice of appeal with the NM Supreme Court. The NM Supreme Court held oral arguments on November 13, 2023. On

 . The IRP is required to cover a planning period and contain an action plan covering the first of that period. On September 14, 2022, the NMPRC adopted revisions to the IRP Rule. The new rule revamps and modernizes the planning process to accommodate increased stakeholder involvement. The IRP Rule establishes a collaborative facilitated process for a utility and stakeholders to agree on a statement of need for potential new or additional resources, as well as an action plan to guide procurement or development of resources to meet the stated need. A most-cost-effective portfolio of resources shall be derived from the statement of need analysis. The statement of need and action plan must be accepted before the utility begins the resource solicitation process pursuant to the IRP Rule. Following acceptance of the statement of need and action plan, a utility will provide the NMPRC and intervenors drafts of the request for proposals RFP and a timeline for issuing, receiving, evaluating, and ranking bids. The NMPRC will then appoint an Independent Monitor IM to oversee the RFP process, which allows for parties and the IM to comment on the RFP consistency with the IRP, after which the utility issues the RFP. Within 120 days of receiving bids the utility shall provide the IM with results including pricing and non-price evaluation criteria, ranking of bids, chosen portfolio and alternatives that also meet the needs; the IM then rules on the fairness of the RFP execution. Acceptance of the statement of need and action plan will not constitute a finding of prudency or pre-approval of costs associated with the additional resources. Following the RFP and IM processes, the utility may apply for approvals, and any costs incurred to implement the action plan will be considered in a general rate case and/or resource acquisition proceeding. On October 14, 2022, PNM and other investor-owned utilities filed motions for rehearing with the NMPRC. On October 26, 2022, the NMPRC issued an order partially granting and partially denying certain aspects of PNM s and the other investor-owned utilities motions for rehearing. On November 2, 2022, the NMPRC adopted an amended IRP Rule. On December 2, 2022, PNM filed an appeal with the NM Supreme Court. Two other investor-owned utilities also separately filed appeals at the NM Supreme Court. On January 3, 2023, PNM and the two other investor-owned utilities filed statements of issues with the NM Supreme Court. Among other things, the investor-owned utilities question whether the IRP Rule exceeds the NMPRC authority by imposing unauthorized requirements on utilities and extending NMPRC jurisdiction through over-broad interpretation of the statutes and state that the IRP Rule is contrary to law in its provisions for NMPRC regulation of a utility s resource procurement decision-making. On June 5, 2023, PNM and the other two investor-owned utilities filed their Joint Brief in Chief and request for oral arguments at the NM Supreme Court. The NM Supreme Court held oral arguments on May 13, 2024. PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
 
 2023 IRP 
 
 On December 15, 2023, PNM filed its 2023 IRP with a continued focus on a carbon-free energy system by 2040. The plan highlights the need for the significant sustained addition of resources over the next two decades, replacing retiring or expiring capacity, meeting concurrent load growth, while reducing the carbon intensity of PNM s portfolio. On April 4, 2024, the NMPRC accepted PNM s 2023 IRP. On May 2, 2024, the NMPRC issued an order appointing an independent monitor who will report the results of PNM s 2023 IRP. 
 
 Abandonment Applications made under the ETA 
 
 SJGS Abandonment Application 
 
 In 2019, PNM filed a Consolidated Application for the Abandonment and Replacement of SJGS and Related Securitized Financing Pursuant to the ETA. In 2023, PNM, along with intervening parties, reached a unanimous settlement which was approved by the NMPRC. As a result, PNM recorded a million reduction to electric operating revenues on TXNM s and PNM s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings, for amounts previously recorded under PNM s current retail rates and a corresponding current regulatory liability on TXNM s and PNM s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023. In addition, PNM recorded a regulatory disallowance of million on TXNM s and PNM s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and a corresponding decrease to deferred regulatory assets on TXNM s and PNM s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 to reflect PNM s agreement to withdraw its request for regulatory assets associated with prefunding of ETA state administered funds and legal costs associated with this matter. Additional information is contained in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

 ownership interest (other than certain transmission assets) in Four Corners to NTEC, contingent upon NMPRC approval. In connection with the sale, PNM would make payments of million to NTEC for relief from its obligations under the coal supply agreement for Four Corners after December 31, 2024. PNM made an initial payment to NTEC of million in November 2020, subject to refund with interest upon termination of the Four Corners Purchase and Sale Agreement prior to closing. Under the terms of the Four Corners Purchase and Sale Agreement, upon receipt of the NMPRC approval, PNM was expected to make a final payment of million. 
 
 On January 8, 2021, PNM filed the Four Corners Abandonment Application, which sought NMPRC approval to exit PNM s share of Four Corners as of December 31, 2024, and issuance of approximately million of Securitized Bonds as provided by the ETA. On December 15, 2021, the NMPRC issued a final order denying approval of the Four Corners Abandonment Application and the corresponding request for issuance of securitized financing. On December 22, 2021, PNM filed a Notice of Appeal with the NM Supreme Court of the NMPRC decision to deny the application and on July 6, 2023, the NM Supreme Court affirmed the NMPRC decision concluding that the NMPRC reasonably and lawfully denied PNM s application for abandonment. As a result of the NM Supreme Court's decision to uphold the NMPRC's denial, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflect a regulatory disallowance of million. On April 23, 2024, PNM filed an interim notice informing the NMPRC that PNM s updated analysis indicates it is in the interest of customers for PNM to remain as a participant in Four Corners until the expiration of the current coal supply agreement in 2031. In August 2024, PNM and NTEC terminated the Four Corners Purchase and Sale Agreement and executed an agreement for the reimbursement of PNM s initial million payment with interest, to be paid in 2024. 
 
 Summer Peak Resource Adequacy 
 
 Beginning in 2021 PNM began providing notices of delays, as received from developers, and status updates to the NMPRC for the approved SJGS replacement resource projects as well as delays in replacement resources for the PVNGS leased capacity that expired in January 2023 and January 2024. PNM s generation resources performed sufficiently with no challenges to resource adequacy during the 2023 and 2024 summer peak seasons. While some of the replacement resources have come online, other replacement resources have experienced additional developer delays and PNM entered into additional firm energy market purchases necessary to meet customer load during the 2024 summer season. See Note 7. 
 
 2026 Resource Application 
 
 On October 25, 2023, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC seeking approval of resources to be available for the 2026 summer peak. The application included a request for approval of a MW solar PPA and battery storage agreements of MW, MW, and MW. In addition, PNM was seeking approval of a CCN for a MW battery storage system to be owned by PNM. The resources were deemed necessary for PNM to safely and reliably meet its projected system load. A hearing was held on March 20 and 21, 2024. On May 3, 2024, the hearing examiner in the case issued a RD approving PNM s requested resources. On May 30, 2024, the NMPRC approved the RD in its entirety. On July 9, 2024, a group of New Mexico legislators filed a petition with the NM Supreme Court requesting the court grant their motion for rehearing, which was denied on September 3, 2024. This matter is now concluded. 
 
 Grid Modernization Application 
 
 On October 3, 2022, in compliance with New Mexico Grid Modernization Statute, PNM filed its Grid Modernization Application with the NMPRC. The projects included in the Grid Modernization Application improve customers ability to customize their use of energy and ensure that customers, including low-income customers, are a top priority and will benefit consistent with the Grid Modernization Statute. PNM s proposal to modernize its electricity grid through infrastructure and technology improvements also increases the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and security of PNM s electric system. PNM s application seeks approval of grid modernization investments of approximately million for the first of a broader strategy. The proposed Grid Modernization Rider would recover capital costs, operating expenses, and taxes associated with the investments included in the Grid Modernization Application. PNM also requested authorization to create related regulatory assets and liabilities, permitting PNM to record costs incurred for the development and implementation of PNM s plan between the requested approval of the application on July 1, 2023, and the implementation of the Grid Modernization Rider by September 1, 2023; undepreciated investments associated with legacy meters being replaced with AMI meters; and over- or under-collection of costs through the Grid Modernization Rider. In addition, PNM requested approval of the proposed

 million total budget and continuation of the current TEP Rider. Approximately of the budget, million, will be dedicated to low-income customers. On February 2, 2024, the hearing examiners in the case issued a RD largely approving PNM s 2024 Plan but with modifications to certain TEP programs. On February 23, 2024, the NMPRC approved the RD with additional modifications that reduced the three-year budget by million, for a total revised budget of million. The TEP rider became effective on April 26, 2024.

 Energy Efficiency 
 
 TNMP recovers the costs of its energy efficiency programs through an energy efficiency cost recovery factor EECRF ), which includes projected program costs, under and over collected costs from prior years, rate case expenses, and performance bonuses (if programs exceed mandated savings goals). TNMP s 2022 EECRF filing requested recovery of million, including a performance bonus of million, and became effective March 1, 2023. On May 26, 2023, TNMP filed its request to adjust the EECRF to reflect changes in costs for 2024. On September 28, 2023, the PUCT approved a unanimous stipulation, authorizing recovery of million, including a performance bonus of million based on TNMP s energy efficiency achievements in the 2022 plan year. On May 31, 2024, TNMP filed its request to adjust the EECRF to reflect changes in costs for 2025. On October 24, 2024, the PUCT approved the total amount requested, authorizing recovery of million, which includes a performance bonus of million based on TNMP s energy efficiency achievements in the 2023 plan year. 
 
 Hurricane Beryl 
 
 On July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in the Texas Gulf Coast leaving approximately customers in the TNMP service area without power. As of September 30, 2024, TNMP has incurred million of costs, of which million has been recorded in Utility Plant and million has been recorded as a regulatory asset in Other Deferred Charges on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. TNMP will continue to track storm-related restoration costs to seek collection of such costs in a future regulatory proceeding. 
 
 System Resiliency Plan SRP 
 
 In 2023, the Texas Legislature enacted House Bill No, 2555 HB 2555 ), permitting an electric utility to seek approval of, and cost recovery for, a system resiliency plan. On August 28, 2024, TNMP filed its first SRP with the PUCT designed to benefit customers through enhanced resiliency of its distribution system, as intended under HB 2555. The SRP includes approximately million of capital investments and approximately million of other related costs over three years and was developed using a comprehensive and data-driven approach which evaluated various types of resiliency events posing material risk to the safe and reliable operation of TNMP's distribution system. TNMP's service territory includes non-contiguous areas across different regions of Texas, ranging from small communities and rural areas to communities around large metropolitan areas, each with unique risks. Investments in the SRP are prioritized based on customer benefit, physical protection of infrastructure, foundational investments in operational and cybersecurity technologies, and wildfire risk reduction and are focused on lower-performing areas in the context of reliability. Eight different resiliency measures are outlined in the SRP with associated programs and infrastructure impacts to improve the system's ability to prevent, withstand, mitigate and/or more promptly recover from resiliency events: distribution system resiliency, distribution system protection modernization, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, flood mitigation, enhanced operations system technology, cybersecurity, and

 Unit 1 leases and January 2016 for Unit 2 leases. Following procedures set forth in the PVNGS leases, PNM notified of the lessors under the Unit 1 leases and lessor under the Unit 2 lease that it would elect to renew those leases on the expiration date of the original leases. The Unit 1 leases expired in January 2023 and the Unit 2 lease expired in January 2024. PNM has no further lease payments related to PVNGS Unit 1 or 2. 
 
 On April 5, 2021, PNM and Salt River Project entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, pursuant to which PNM agreed to sell to Salt River Project certain PNM-owned assets and nuclear fuel necessary to the ongoing operation and maintenance of leased capacity in PVNGS Unit 1 and Unit 2. In January 2023, the Unit 1 leases expired, and PNM closed on the associated sale to Salt River Project, receiving payments of million, of which million was recorded as a reduction to Net utility plant on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as cash flows from investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, million was recorded as a reduction to materials, supplies, and fuel stock on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In January 2024, the Unit 2 leases expired, and PNM closed on the associated sale to Salt River Project, receiving payments of million, of which million was recorded as a reduction to Net utility plant on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as cash flows from investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, million was recorded as a reduction to Materials, supplies and fuel stock on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
 
 Land Easements and Rights-of-Ways 
 
 Many of PNM s electric transmission and distribution facilities are located on lands that require the grant of rights-of-way from governmental entities, Native American tribes, or private parties. PNM has completed several renewals of rights-of-way, the largest of which is a renewal with the Navajo Nation. PNM is obligated to pay the Navajo Nation annual payments of million, subject to adjustment each year based on the Consumer Price Index, through 2029. PNM s April 2024 payment for the amount due under the Navajo Nation right-of-way lease was million, which included amounts due under the Consumer Price Index adjustment. Changes in the Consumer Price Index subsequent to January 1, 2019 are considered variable lease payments. 
 
 PNM has other prepaid rights-of-way agreements that are not accounted for as leases or recognized as a component of plant in service. PNM reflects the unamortized balance of these prepayments in other deferred charges on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes amortization expense associated with these agreements in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings over their term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized balance of these rights-of-ways was million and million. PNM recognized amortization expense associated with these agreements of million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Recent Developments 
 
 System Resiliency Plan SRP 
 
 In 2023, the Texas Legislature enacted HB 2555, permitting an electric utility to seek approval of, and cost recovery for a system resiliency plan. On August 28, 2024, TNMP filed its first SRP with the PUCT designed to benefit customers through enhanced resiliency of its distribution system, as intended under HB 2555.

More than 600 employees in both states participated in the annual Day of Service , a workday event encouraging employee volunteerism and serving more than 50 organizations. Throughout the year, employees volunteer their time generously through independent volunteer activities and board participation. Employees strengthen community resilience by giving at least 9,000 volunteer hours each year to support the health, safety, and well-being of diverse communities. 
 
 Financial Focus 
 
 Earning Authorized Returns on Regulated Businesses 
 
 TXNM s success in accomplishing its financial objectives is highly dependent on two key factors: fair and timely regulatory treatment for its utilities and the utilities strong operating performance. The Company has multiple strategies to achieve favorable regulatory treatment, all of which have as their foundation a focus on the basics: safety, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction, while engaging stakeholders to build productive relationships. Both PNM and TNMP seek cost recovery for their investments through general rate cases, periodic cost of service filings, and various rate riders. See Note 12. 
 
 Fair and timely rate treatment from regulators is crucial to PNM and TNMP in earning their allowed returns and critical for TXNM to achieve its financial objectives. TXNM believes that earning allowed returns is viewed positively by credit rating agencies and that improvements in the Company s ratings could lower costs to utility customers. 
 
 The rates PNM and TNMP charge customers are subject to traditional rate regulation by the NMPRC, FERC, and the PUCT. Additional information about rate filings is provided in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 State Regulation and Legislation 
 
 TNMP 
 
 In the 2023 Texas Legislative session several bills were passed to support utility reliability and resiliency by encouraging and protecting utility infrastructure investments. The bill with the largest near-term financial impact to TNMP is the DCRF legislation that adds a second filing per year and shortens the regulatory timeframe for the proceedings. Other bills include system resiliency and temporary mobile generation, which provide opportunities for added investment in TNMP s service territory and reduce uncertainty around rate recovery. Another bill directs ERCOT to develop reliability plans for the Permian Basin which could result in the need for additional investments in the West Texas service territory. Additionally, the Damaging Critical Infrastructure Bill helps protect TNMP s investments in response to criminal offenses damaging critical infrastructure facilities. These pieces of legislation demonstrate that Texas continues to encourage utility investment and prioritizes timely rate recovery. TNMP will look to prioritize investments aligned with these measures that improve the quality of service for current and future customers. 
 
 The regulatory framework in Texas strongly encourages investments into the grid by providing timely recovery through rate mechanisms outside of general rate cases. The PUCT has approved mechanisms that allow TNMP to recover capital invested in transmission and distribution projects without having to file a general rate case. The PUCT also approved rate riders that allow TNMP to recover amounts related to energy efficiency and third-party transmission costs. In August 2024, TNMP filed its first resiliency plan under the new rules implementing the legislation passed in 2023. An independent evaluation and development of a system resiliency plan covering three years is required in the filing. Under the rules, TNMP may choose to recover the associated capital investments under the existing TCOS and DCRF rules. The rules also allow for recovery of certain O M costs, such as vegetation management expenditures that exceed the amount authorized for recovery in 
 83

 base rates. See Note 12. TNMP also has approximately 276,000 advanced meters across its service territory, the costs of which are being recovered through base rates. 
 
 PNM 
 
 The Energy Transition Act ETA 
 
 The ETA requires utilities operating in New Mexico to have renewable portfolios equal to 40 by 2025, 50 by 2030, 80 by 2040, and 100 zero-carbon energy by 2045. The ETA also allows for the recovery of undepreciated investments and decommissioning costs related to qualifying EGUs that the NMPRC has required be removed from retail jurisdictional rates, provided replacement resources to be included in retail rates have lower or zero-carbon emissions. The ETA provides for a transition from fossil-fueled generating resources to renewable and other carbon-free resources by allowing utilities to issue securitized bonds, or energy transition bonds, related to the retirement of certain coal-fired generating facilities to qualified investors. See additional discussion of the ETA in Notes 11 and 12 and the issuance of Securitized Bonds in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 2024 Rate Change 
 
 In December 2022, PNM filed the 2024 Rate Change with the NMPRC. The application proposed an increase of 63.8 million in base non-fuel revenues. The requested increase is based on a calendar year 2024 FTY and reflects an ROE of 10.25 . On January 3, 2024, the NMPRC issued a final order authorizing PNM to implement an increase in non-fuel base rates of 15.3 million, effective for service beginning January 15, 2024. Major components of the final order, included: 
 
 A ROE of 9.26 
 A capital structure of 49.61 equity, 50.10 debt, and 0.29 preferred stock 
 Finding of imprudence regarding PNM s decision to remain in Four Corners and a remedy for the imprudence resulting in a disallowance of 81.0 million to PNM s total Four Corners net book value. 
 Approval of 51.3 million of PNM s requested 96.3 million regulatory asset for PVNGS undepreciated investments, but disallowance of a return on the remaining 45.0 million or any CWIP associated with it. 
 
 The final order also requires that the regulatory liability associated with leased capacity at PVNGS after the Unit 1 lease expired on January 15, 2023, be returned to ratepayers over two years through a rate rider. In addition, the NMPRC approved new depreciation rates for specific gas plants, reflecting shorter useful lives, approval of PNM s TOD pilot program, and ordered PNM to update the remedy associated with Four Corners. See Note 12. 
 
 Grid Modernization Application 
 
 On October 3, 2022, in compliance with New Mexico Grid Modernization Statute, PNM filed its Grid Modernization Application with the NMPRC. The projects included in the Grid Modernization Application improve customers ability to customize their use of energy and ensure that customers, including low-income customers, are a top priority and will benefit from the electricity grid consistent with the Grid Modernization Statute. PNM s proposal to modernize its electricity grid through infrastructure and technology improvements also increases the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and security of PNM s electric system. PNM s application seeks approval of grid modernization investments of approximately 344 million for the first six years of a broader 11-year strategy. The proposed Grid Modernization Rider would recover capital costs, operating expenses, and taxes associated with the investments included in the Grid Modernization Application. On August 16, 2024, the hearing examiner in the case issued a RD. The RD largely approved PNM s application with minor modifications, including limiting to a return of its undepreciated costs of legacy meters and conditioned approval upon PNM accelerating the deployment schedule following a final order. On October 17, 2024, the NMPRC issued a final order adopting the RD but removed the accelerated deployment schedule. See Note 12. 
 
 2026 Resource Application 
 
 On October 25, 2023, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC seeking approval of resources to be available for the 2026 summer peak. The application included a request for approval of a 100 MW solar PPA and three battery storage agreements of 100 MW, 100 MW, and 50 MW. In addition, PNM was seeking approval of a CCN for a 60 MW battery storage system to be owned by PNM. The resources were deemed necessary for PNM to safely and reliably meet its projected system load. On May 30, 2024, the NMPRC approved PNM s requested resources in its entirety.

 PNM Rate Riders and other 
 
 The NMPRC has approved PNM recovering fuel costs through the FPPAC, as well as rate riders for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and the TEP. These mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of investments. PNM s Grid Modernization Application includes proposals for installation and deployment of advanced metering infrastructure investments and recovery under a rate rider permitted by New Mexico legislation. See Note 12. 
 
 FERC Regulation 
 
 Rates PNM charges wholesale transmission customers are subject to traditional rate regulation by FERC. Rates charged to wholesale electric transmission customers, other than customers on the Western Spirit Line, are based on a formula rate mechanism pursuant to which rates for wholesale transmission service are calculated annually in accordance with an approved formula. The formula includes updating cost of service components, including investment in plant and operating expenses, based on information contained in PNM s annual financial report filed with FERC, as well as including projected transmission capital projects to be placed into service in the following year. The projections included are subject to true-up. Certain items, including changes to return on equity and depreciation rates, require a separate filing to be made with FERC before being included in the formula rate. 
 
 Delivering At or Above Industry-Average Earnings and Dividend Growth 
 
 TXNM s financial objective to deliver at or above industry-average earnings and dividend growth enables investors to realize the value of their investment in the Company s business. Earnings growth is based on ongoing earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes from GAAP earnings certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company s operations. TXNM uses ongoing earnings to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. 
 
 TXNM targets a dividend payout ratio in the 50 to 60 range of its ongoing earnings. TXNM expects to provide at or above industry-average dividend growth in the near-term. The Board will continue to evaluate the dividend on an annual basis, considering sustainability and growth, capital planning, and industry standards. 
 
 The Board approved the following increases in the indicated annual common stock dividend: 
 
 Approval Date Percent Increase December 2022 5.8 December 2023 
 5.4 
 
 Maintaining Investment Grade Credit Ratings 
 
 The Company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings in order to reduce the cost of debt financing and to help ensure access to credit markets, when required. On January 15, 2024, S P revised TXNM, PNM, and TNMP s outlook to stable from positive. See the subheading Liquidity included in the full discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources below for the specific credit ratings for TXNM, PNM, and TNMP. All of the credit ratings issued by both Moody s and S P on the Company s debt continue to be investment grade. 
 
 Economic Factors 
 
 TNMP In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, TNMP experienced an increase of 4.3 and 2.3 in volumetric weather normalized retail load compared to 2023. Weather normalized demand-based load, excluding retail transmission consumers increased 2.6 and decreased 0.9 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 PNM In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PNM experienced an increase of 0.9 and 0.7 in weather normalized residential load. Weather normalized commercial load experienced an increase of 0.4 and 0.3 compared to 2023. In addition, PNM experienced an increase in industrial load of 15.5 and 11.1 compared to 2023. 
 
 The Company is closely monitoring the impacts on the capital markets of other macroeconomic conditions, including actions by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary concerns or other market conditions, and geopolitical activity . The Company has not experienced, nor does it expect significant negative impacts to customer usage at PNM and TNMP resulting from these economic impacts. However, if current economic conditions worsen, the Company may be required to implement additional measures such as reducing or delaying operating and maintenance expenses and planned capital expenditures.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Net earnings attributable to TXNM were 226.4 million, or 2.50 per diluted share in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 138.0 million, or 1.60 per diluted share in 2023. Among other things, earnings in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from rate relief approved in PNM s 2024 Rate Change, higher transmission and distribution rates at TNMP, higher volumetric load at TNMP, higher weather normalized retail load at PNM, and increased performance on PNM s NDT, coal mine reclamation and SJGS decommissioning investment securities. In addition, rate credits as a result of the SJGS abandonment settlement agreement decreased earnings in 2023 compared to 2024. These increases were partially offset by increased operational and maintenance expense, including higher employee related, outside services and vegetation management expenses at PNM, increased depreciation and amortization approved in PNM s 2024 Rate Change and increased plant in service at PNM and TNMP, regulatory disallowance at PNM related to San Juan Coal Mine reclamation remeasurement, lower transmission margin at PNM, capacity arrangements at PNM, milder weather at TNMP and PNM, and higher interest charges at PNM, TNMP and Corporate and Other. Additional information on factors impacting results of operations for each segment is discussed below under Results of Operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, TXNM, PNM, and TNMP have revolving credit facilities with capacities of 300.0 million, 440.0 million, and 200.0 million. Total availability for TXNM on a consolidated basis was 468.8 million at October 25, 2024. The Company utilizes these credit facilities and cash flows from operations to provide funds for both construction and operational expenditures. TXNM also has intercompany loan agreements with each of its subsidiaries. For additional details regarding the Company s revolving credit facilities see Note 9. 
 
 TXNM projects that its consolidated capital requirements, consisting of construction expenditures and dividends, will total 6.9 billion for 2024 - 2028, including amounts expended through September 30, 2024. These construction expenditures include TNMP s investments to support continued high growth in system demand across TNMP s service territories and growing encouragement for infrastructure investments from the Texas legislature to support grid reliability and resilience. PNM s capital initiatives for investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure to deliver clean energy, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase grid resilience. Construction expenditures also include investments proposed in PNM s Grid Modernization Application and TNMP s SRP. 
 
 To fund capital spending requirements to meet growth that balances earnings goals, credit metrics and liquidity needs, the Company has entered into a number of other financing arrangements. A complete listing of current financing arrangements is contained in Note 9 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
 
 After considering the effects of these financings and the Company s short-term liquidity position as of October 25, 2024, the Company has consolidated maturities of long-term and short-term debt aggregating approximately 880.0 million through October 2025. In addition to internal cash generation, the Company anticipates that it will be necessary to obtain additional long-term financing in the form of debt refinancing, new debt issuances, and/or new equity in order to fund its capital requirements during the 2024-2028 period. The Company currently believes that its internal cash generation, existing credit arrangements, and access to public and private capital markets will provide sufficient resources to meet the Company s capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024 and October 25, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.

 Segment Information 
 
 The following discussion is based on the segment methodology that TXNM s management uses for making operating decisions and assessing performance of its various business activities. See Note 2 for more information on TXNM s operating segments. 

TNMP 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 TNMP defines utility margin as electric operating revenues less cost of energy, which consists of costs charged by third-party transmission providers. TNMP believes that utility margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating operations than electric operating revenues since all third-party transmission costs are passed on to consumers through a transmission cost recovery factor. Utility margin is not a financial measure required to be presented and is considered a non-GAAP measure. TNMP does not intend for utility margin to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP however, the calculation of utility margin, as presented, most closely compares to gross margin as defined by GAAP. Reconciliations between utility margin and gross margin are presented below.

 Financing Activities 
 
 See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Note 9 for additional information concerning the Company s financing activities. PNM must obtain NMPRC approval for any financing transaction having a maturity of more than 18 months. In addition, PNM files its annual informational financing filing and short-term financing plan with the NMPRC. 
 
 The Company s ability to access the credit and capital markets at a reasonable cost is largely dependent upon its: 
 
 Ability to earn a fair return on equity 
 Results of operations 
 Ability to obtain required regulatory approvals 
 Conditions in the financial markets 
 Credit ratings 
 
 The Company is closely monitoring the impacts on the capital markets of other macroeconomic conditions, including actions by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary concerns or other market conditions, and geopolitical activity. The Company currently believes it has adequate liquidity but cannot predict the effects of any of these macroeconomic conditions on the global, national, or local economy, including the Company s ability to access capital in the financial markets, or on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 Each of the Company s revolving credit facilities and term loans contain a single financial covenant that requires the maintenance of a debt-to-capitalization ratio. For the TXNM agreements, this ratio must be maintained at less than or equal to 70 , and for the PNM and TNMP agreements, this ratio must be maintained at less than or equal to 65 . The Company s revolving credit facilities, term loans, and other debt agreements generally also contain customary covenants, events of default, cross-default provisions, and change-of-control provisions. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants. 
 
 On March 28, 2024, TNMP entered into the TNMP 2024 Bond Purchase Agreement for the sale of 285.0 million aggregate principal amount of four series of TNMP first mortgage bonds. TNMP issued the first two series on March 28, 2024, consisting of 32.0 million at a 5.26 interest rate, due March 28, 2029, and 85.0 million at a 5.55 interest rate, due March 28, 2036. The third and fourth series were issued on July 1, 2024, consisting of 40.0 million at a 5.65 interest rate, due July 1, 2039, and 128.0 million at a 5.79 interest rate, due July 1, 2054. The proceeds were used to repay 80.0 million of 4.03 TNMP FMBs, to repay borrowings under the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility, to fund capital expenditures, and for other corporate purposes. 
 
 In May 2024, TXNM entered into the TXNM 2024 ATM Program pursuant to which TXNM may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of 100.0 million of its common stock. In August 2024, subsequent to approval by shareholders to increase TXNM s authorized shares, the Company increased the aggregate sales amount from 100.0 million to 300.0 million of its common stock, no par value, that may be sold under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program. During the second quarter of 2024, TXNM entered into a forward sales agreement with a forward purchaser relating to the sale of 262,025 shares of common stock, under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program. The initial forward sale price of 37.77 per share is subject to adjustments based on a net interest rate factor and by future dividends paid on TXNM common stock. During the third quarter of 2024, TXNM entered into forward sales agreements with forward purchasers relating to the sale of 2,196,926 shares of common stock, under the TXNM 2024 ATM Program. The Q3 2024 Forward Sale Agreements have a weighted average initial forward sale price of 40.58 per share that is subject to adjustments based on a net interest rate factor and by future dividends paid on TXNM common stock. TXNM did not receive any proceeds upon the execution of this agreement and, except in

 certain specified circumstances, has the option to elect physical, cash, or net share settlement of the forward sale agreement on or before a date that is 12 months from the agreement effective dates. Refer to Note 9 for information regarding the initial forward sale price, the Company's settlement options and related accounting treatment. As of September 30, 2024, no shares have been settled under the 2024 Forward Sales Agreements. 
 
 On May 10, 2024, PNM entered into the 200.0 million PNM 2024 Term Loan. PNM used the proceeds of the PNM 2024 Term Loan to repay borrowings under the PNM Revolving Credit Facility, the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility, and for other corporate purposes. The PNM 2024 Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate, which was 6.11 at September 30, 2024, and must be repaid on or before November 10, 2025. 
 
 On June 10, 2024, TXNM issued 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 and mature on June 1, 2054, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms. On June 21, 2024, TXNM issued an additional 50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, pursuant to an overallotment option granted by TXNM to the initial purchasers of the 500.0 million Convertible Notes. Proceeds from the Convertible Notes were used to prepay 449.0 million of borrowings under the TXNM 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan and 90.0 million of borrowings under the TXNM 2023 Term Loan, without penalty, and for other corporate purposes. See Note 9 for details related to the conversion rate and conditions for such conversion. 
 
 At December 31, 2023, PNM had outstanding 37.0 million of 3.00 PCRBs and 125.0 million of 1.15 PCRBs issued by the City of Farmington, New Mexico with a mandatory remarketing date of June 1, 2024 and final maturities of June 2040 and 36.0 million of 3.00 PCRBs issued by Maricopa County, Arizona with a mandatory remarketing date of June 1, 2024 and a final maturity of January 2038. On June 3, 2024, PNM remarketed these PCRBs aggregating 198.0 million to new investors at 3.875 with a mandatory tender date of June 1, 2029. 
 
 TXNM has entered into multiple hedging arrangements, with maturity dates of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025. See Note 9 for the related effective dates and terms of each arrangement. All of these hedging agreements establish a fixed rate for the indicated amount of variable rate debt, above which a customary spread is applied, which is subject to change if there is a change in TXNM s credit rating. These hedge agreements have been accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 
 Capital Requirements 
 
 TXNM s total capital requirements consist of construction expenditures and cash dividend requirements for TXNM common stock and PNM preferred stock. 
 
 Key activities in TXNM s current construction program include: 
 
 Investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure 
 Upgrading generation resources and delivering clean energy 
 Purchasing nuclear fuel 
 
 Projected capital requirements, including amounts expended through September 30, 2024, are: 
 
 2024 
 2025-2028 
 Total (In millions) Construction expenditures 1,216.3 5,026.9 6,243.2 Dividends on TXNM common stock 
 139.8 559.3 699.1 Dividends on PNM preferred stock 0.5 2.1 2.6 Total capital requirements 1,356.6 5,588.3 6,944.9 
 
 The construction expenditure estimates are under continuing review and subject to ongoing adjustment, as well as to Board review and approval. The construction expenditures above include TNMP s investments to support continued high growth in system demand across TNMP s service territories and growing encouragement for infrastructure investments from the Texas legislature to support grid reliability and resilience. PNM s capital initiatives include investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure to deliver clean energy, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase grid resilience. Construction expenditures also include investments proposed in PNM s Grid Modernization Application and TNMP s SRP. These investments provide for a more resilient, reliable, efficient, and decarbonized electric system. Not included in the table above are incremental expenditures for new customer growth in New Mexico and Texas, and other transmission and renewable energy expansion in New Mexico. The ability of TXNM to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon the ability of PNM and TNMP to pay dividends to TXNM. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual

Table of Contents 

 Reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by PNM and TNMP. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, TXNM met its capital requirements and construction expenditures through cash generated from operations, as well as its liquidity arrangements and the borrowings discussed in Financing Activities above. 
 
 In addition to the capital requirements for construction expenditures and dividends, the Company has long-term debt and term loans that must be paid or refinanced at maturity. PNM has 3.4 million and 3.5 million in scheduled payments due for the ETBC I Securitized Bonds in February and August 2025. PNM also has 104.0 million and 250.0 million of SUNs that are due in May and August 2025. TXNM has 51.0 million outstanding under the TXNM 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loan that matures in May 2025. See Note 9 for additional information about the Company s long-term debt and equity arrangements. The Company may also enter into new arrangements similar to the existing agreements, borrow under the revolving credit facilities, or issue new long-term debt or equity in the public or private capital markets, or a combination of these sources. The Company has from time to time refinanced or repurchased portions of its outstanding debt before scheduled maturity. Depending on market conditions, the Company may refinance other debt issuances or make additional debt repurchases in the future. 
 
 Liquidity 
 TXNM s liquidity arrangements include the 300.0 million TXNM Revolving Credit Facility, the 400.0 million PNM Revolving Credit Facility, and the 200.0 million TNMP Revolving Credit Facility. On April 1, 2024, TXNM and PNM amended their respective revolving credit facilities, extending their maturity to March 30, 2029, with two one-year extension options that, if exercised, would extend the maturity to March 2031, subject to approval by a majority of the lenders. PNM also has the 40.0 million PNM New Mexico Credit Facility with a maturity of May 20, 2026. On April 1, 2024, TNMP entered into its new 200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility that has a maturity of March 30, 2029 with two one-year extension options that, if exercised, would extend the maturity to March 2031, subject to approval by a majority of the lenders. Variable interest rates under the TXNM, PNM, and TNMP revolving credit facilities are based on SOFR. The Company believes the terms and conditions of these facilities are consistent with those of other investment grade revolving credit facilities in the utility industry. The Company expects that it will be able to extend or replace these credit facilities under similar terms and conditions prior to their expirations. 
 
 The revolving credit facilities and the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility provide short-term borrowing capacity. The revolving credit facilities also allow letters of credit to be issued. Letters of credit reduce the available capacity under the facilities. The Company utilizes these credit facilities and cash flows from operations to provide funds for both construction and operational expenditures. The Company s business is seasonal with more revenues and cash flows from operations being generated in the summer months. In general, the Company relies on the credit facilities to be the initial funding source for construction expenditures. Accordingly, borrowings under the facilities may increase over time. Depending on market and other conditions, the Company will periodically issue long-term debt and use the proceeds to reduce the borrowings under the credit facilities or refinance other debt. Information regarding the range of borrowings for each facility is as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Range of Borrowings Low High Low High (In millions) PNM: PNM Revolving Credit Facility 28.5 159.9 178.2 PNM New Mexico Credit Facility 20.0 40.0 40.0 TNMP Revolving Credit Facility 20.0 97.5 11.2 100.6 TXNM Revolving Credit Facility 
 150.0 222.0 31.1 222.0 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rates were 6.39 for the PNM Revolving Credit Facility, 6.20 for the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility, 5.96 for the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility, and 6.58 for the TXNM Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company currently believes that its capital requirements for at least the next twelve months can be met through internal cash generation, existing, extended, or new credit arrangements, and access to public and private capital markets as discussed above and in Note 9. The Company anticipates that it will be necessary to obtain additional long-term financing to fund its capital requirements and to balance its capital structure during the 2024-2028 period. This could include new debt and/or equity issuances. To cover the difference in the amounts and timing of internal cash generation and cash requirements, the Company intends to use short-term borrowings under its current and future liquidity arrangements or other short-term loans. Market conditions, such as rising interest rates, may raise the cost of borrowing under the Company s current and future 
 102 

Table of Contents 

 liquidity arrangements or other variable debt. In addition, if market conditions worsen, the Company may not be able to access the capital markets or renew credit facilities when they expire. Should that occur, the Company would seek to improve cash flows by reducing capital expenditures and exploring other available alternatives.

 Contingent Provisions of Certain Obligations 
 
 As discussed in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K, TXNM, PNM, and TNMP have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions. Some of these, if triggered, could affect the liquidity of the Company. In the unlikely event that the contingent requirements were to be triggered, TXNM, PNM, or TNMP could be required to provide security, immediately pay outstanding obligations, or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements. The contingent provisions also include contractual increases in the interest rate charged on certain of the Company s short-term debt obligations in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings. The Company believes its financing arrangements are sufficient to meet the requirements of the contingent provisions. No conditions have occurred that would result in any of the above contingent provisions being implemented.

OTHER ISSUES FACING THE COMPANY 
 Climate Change Issues 
 
 Background 
 
 For the past several years, management has identified multiple risks and opportunities related to climate change, including the impacts of climate change and severe weather events, potential environmental regulation, technological innovation, and availability of fuel and water for operations, as among the most significant risks facing the Company. Accordingly, these risks are overseen by the Board in order to facilitate more integrated risk and strategy oversight and planning. Board oversight includes understanding the various challenges and opportunities presented by these risks, including the financial consequences that might result from enacted and potential federal and/or state regulation of GHG; plans to mitigate these risks; and the impacts these risks may have on the Company s strategy. In addition, the Board approves certain procurements of grid modernization technologies and replacement resources. 
 
 Management is also responsible for assessing significant risks, developing and executing appropriate responses, and reporting to the Board on the status of risk activities. For example, management periodically updates the Board on the implementation of corporate environmental policy, and the Company s environmental management systems, including the promotion of energy efficiency programs, and the use of renewable resources. The Board is also informed of the Company s practices and procedures to assess the impacts of operations on the environment. The Board considers issues associated with climate change, the Company s GHG exposures, and the financial consequences that might result from enacted and potential federal and/or state regulation of GHG. Management has published, with Board oversight, a Climate Change Report available at https://www.txnmenergy.com/esg-commitment/environment/climate_change_report.aspx that details the Company s efforts to transition to a carbon-free generating portfolio by 2040. 
 
 As part of management s continuing effort to monitor climate-related risks and assess opportunities, the Company has advanced its understanding of climate change by participating in the 2 Degree Scenario planning by participating in the

Table of Contents 

 Electric Power Research Institute EPRI Understanding Climate Scenarios Goal Setting Activities program. The program focused on characterizing and analyzing the relationship of individual electric utility company s carbon emissions and global temperature goals. Activities include analyzing the scientific understanding of global emissions pathways that are consistent with limiting global warming and providing insight to assist companies in developing approaches to climate scenario planning. As PNM expands its sustainability efforts, EPRI s environmental and climate analysis programs have also been useful in gaining a better understanding of energy and environmental policy and regulations, advanced clean energy technologies, decarbonization trends and climate impacts. In 2022, PNM joined EPRI s Climate READi program which is a strategic initiative convening a global collaborative of electric utilities, thought leaders, scientific researchers and other key stakeholders to strengthen the power sector s collective approach to managing climate risk to the power system. The program is a three-year initiative, through work across three concurrent workstreams, and PNM will benefit from the development of a first-of-its-kind comprehensive framework for managing physical climate risk and investment prioritization. 
 
 The Company cannot anticipate or predict the potential long-term effects of climate change or climate change related regulation on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Exposures 
 
 In 2023, GHG emissions associated with PNM s interests in its fossil-fueled generating plants included approximately 2.7 million metric tons of CO 2 , which comprises the vast majority of PNM s GHG emissions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 36 of PNM s generating capacity, including resources owned, leased, under PPAs or battery storage agreements, all of which is located within the U.S., consisted of coal or gas-fired generation that produces GHG emissions. As PNM shifts its generation to cleaner energy resources, the Company s output of GHG emissions continues to decrease. Many factors affect the amount of GHG emitted, including total electricity sales, plant performance, economic dispatch, and the availability of renewable resources. For example, wind generation performance from PNM s largest single renewable energy resource, New Mexico Wind, varies each year as a result of highly seasonal wind patterns and annual wind resource variability. Similarly, if PVNGS experienced prolonged outages or if PNM s entitlement from PVNGS were reduced, PNM might be required to utilize other power supply resources such as gas-fired generation, which could increase GHG emissions. 
 
 PNM has several programs underway to reduce or offset GHG emissions from its generation resource portfolio, thereby reducing its exposure to climate change regulation. PNM shutdown SJGS Units 2 and 3 as part of its strategy to address the regional haze requirements of the CAA. The shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3 resulted in a reduction of GHG emissions for the entire station of approximately 54 for 2018, reflecting a reduction of 32 of GHG emissions from the Company s owned interests in SJGS, below 2005 levels. PNM shut down the remaining SJGS Units 1 and 4 on June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, resulting in additional reductions GHG emissions. Retiring PNM s share of SJGS in 2022 resulted in a GHG emissions reduction from 2021 levels of 67 of PNM s GHG emissions based upon 2021 GHG emissions from generation. 
 PNM s utility-owned solar capacity, as well as solar, wind, and geothermal renewable procurements in service as of September 30, 2024 have a total net generation capacity of 1,647 MW in addition to 232 MW of utility-owned battery storage and battery storage agreements. The NMPRC has approved plans for PNM to procure energy and RECs from additional resources to serve retail customers and a data center located in PNM s service territory, including the portfolio to replace SJGS and the PVNGS Leased Interest Abandonment Application. PNM s approved resource plans have a generation capacity of 1,810 MW and are expected to be in operation before summer 2026. The majority of these resources are key means for PNM to meet the RPS and related regulations that require PNM to achieve prescribed levels of energy sales from renewable sources, including those set by the ETA, without exceeding cost requirements. Approval of these renewable energy and battery resources supports PNM s transition to a carbon-free portfolio by 2040. These estimates are subject to change due to underlying variables, including changes in PNM s generation portfolio, supplier s ability to meet contractual in-service dates and complex relationships between several factors. See additional discussion of these resources in Notes 11 and 12. 
 
 PNM also has a customer distributed solar generation program that represented 302.4 MW at September 30, 2024. PNM s distributed solar programs will generate an estimated 604.8 GWh of emission-free solar energy available this year to offset PNM s annual production from fossil-fueled electricity generation. Under the Community Solar Act PNM will receive approximately 310 MW of capacity to provide customers the option of accessing solar energy, which includes PNM s allocated portion from the NMPRC s October 2024 order. PNM has offered its customers a comprehensive portfolio of energy efficiency and load management programs since 2007. PNM s cumulative savings from these programs was approximately 7,454 GWh of electricity through 2023. Over the next 20 years, PNM projects energy efficiency and load management programs will provide the equivalent of approximately 12,900 GWh of electricity savings, which will avoid approximately 220,000 tons of CO 2 based upon projected emissions from PNM s portfolio of resources. These estimates are subject to change because of the uncertainty of many of the underlying variables, including changes in PNM s generation portfolio, demand for electricity, energy efficiency, and complex relationships between those variables.

Table of Contents 

 Because of PNM s dependence on fossil-fueled generation, legislation or regulation that imposes a limit or cost on GHG could impact the cost at which electricity is produced. While PNM expects to recover any such costs through rates, the timing and outcome of proceedings for cost recovery are uncertain. In addition, to the extent that any additional costs are recovered through rates, customers may reduce their usage, relocate facilities to other areas with lower energy costs, or take other actions that ultimately could adversely impact PNM. 
 
 Other Climate Change Risks 
 
 PNM s generating stations are located in the arid southwest. Access to water for cooling for some of these facilities is critical to continued operations. Forecasts for the impacts of climate change on water supply in the southwest range from reduced precipitation to changes in the timing of precipitation. In either case, PNM s generating facilities requiring water for cooling will need to mitigate the impacts of climate change through adaptive measures. Current measures employed by PNM generating stations include the use of sustainable, less variable groundwater supplies, and investments in technologies such as air cooling and cooling water recycling. These types of actions will continue to be important to sustain operations. 
 
 PNM s service areas occasionally experience periodic high winds and severe thunderstorms. TNMP has operations in the Gulf Coast area of Texas, which experiences periodic hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. In addition to potentially causing physical damage to Company-owned facilities, which disrupts the ability to transmit and/or distribute energy, weather and other events of nature can temporarily reduce customers usage and demand for energy. In addition, other events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, could disrupt Company operations or result in third-party claims against the Company. PNM has enhanced its wildfire prevention efforts and maintains a wildfire mitigation plan and a public safety power shutoff plan. TNMP has also developed a wildfire mitigation plan. However, both PNM and TNMP remain at risk for wildfires outside of their control and the resulting damages in their service areas. 
 
 EPA Regulation 
 
 In 2007, the US Supreme Court held that EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA, and in 2009, EPA released its endangerment finding for GHG from new motor vehicles, stating that the atmospheric concentrations of six key greenhouse gases (CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) endanger the public health and welfare. These actions triggered new GHG permitting requirements for stationary sources, including the energy industry, under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration PSD and Title V program, although the US Supreme Court held the CAA does not authorize EPA to require a source to obtain a PSD permit solely on the basis of its potential GHG emissions. 
 
 EPA also determined that its finding of endangerment requires it to issue performance standards under Section 111 of the CAA to regulate GHG emissions from new and existing stationary sources, including fossil fuel fired electric generating units. Accordingly, in 2015, EPA issued Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants (under Section 111(b)) and the Clean Power Plan for existing power plants (under Section 111(d)). 
 
 EPA s Carbon Pollution Standards for new sources (those constructed after January 8, 2014) established separate standards for gas and coal-fired units deemed achievable through the application of what EPA determined to be the BSER demonstrated for each type of unit: efficient natural gas combined cycle technology for gas units, and partial carbon capture and sequestration for coal units. The Clean Power Plan established numeric emission standards for existing electric generating units based on emission reduction opportunities that EPA deemed achievable using technical assumptions for three building blocks : efficiency improvements at coal-fired EGUs, displacement of affected EGUs with renewable energy, and displacement of coal-fired generation with natural gas-fired generation. EPA used those emission standards to set state emission reduction goals that formed the basis of a trading program that relied on generation shifting to reduce emissions from the power sector as a whole. 
 
 Multiple states, utilities, and trade groups challenged both the Carbon Pollution Standards for new sources and the Clean Power Plan for existing sources in separate cases, and the challengers successfully petitioned the US Supreme Court for a stay of the Clean Power Plan. However, before the DC Circuit could issue an opinion regarding either the Carbon Pollution Standards or the Clean Power Plan, President Trump took office and his administration asked the court to hold both cases in abeyance while the rules were re-evaluated, which the court granted. 
 
 In 2019, EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan, promulgated the ACE Rule, and revised the implementing regulations for all emission guidelines issued under CAA Section 111(d). EPA set the BSER for existing coal-fired power plants as heat rate efficiency improvements based on a range of candidate technologies to be applied inside the fence-line of an individual facility. The ACE Rule was also challenged, and on January 19, 2021, the DC Circuit issued an opinion in American Lung Association and American Public Health Association v. EPA, et al. vacating the ACE Rule. While the D.C. Circuit rejected the ACE Rule, it did not reinstate the Clean Power Plan. Rather, the DC Circuit granted an EPA motion asking the court to withhold issuance of the mandate with respect to the repeal of the Clean Power Plan until EPA responds to the court s remand in a new rulemaking action.

Table of Contents 

 Numerous parties sought review by the US Supreme Court and on June 30, 2022, the Court held that the generation shifting approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to EPA by Congress, though the Court did not address the related issue of whether Section 111 of the CAA only authorizes EPA to require measures that can be implemented entirely within the fence line at an individual source. Of broader significance in administrative law, the Court s opinion expressly invoked the major question doctrine, which requires rules involving issues of vast economic or political significance, to be supported by clear statutory authorization. In cases where there is no clear statement of authority, courts need not defer to the agency s statutory interpretation on major questions. The decision sets legal precedent for future rulemakings by EPA and other federal regulatory agencies whereby the agency s authority may be limited based upon similar reasoning. 
 
 The litigation over the Carbon Pollution Standards remains held in abeyance but could be reactivated by the parties upon a determination by the court that reconsideration of the rule has concluded. 
 
 In 2023, EPA published in the Federal Register proposed regulatory actions under CAA sections 111(b) and (d) to replace the Clean Power Plan and the ACE Rule, and finalized the rules on May 9, 2024. The final rules include revised new source performance standards under Section 111(b) for all new natural gas-fired combustion turbines and emission guidelines under Section 111(d) requiring states to develop standards of performance for GHG emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units. In the final rules, EPA determined that the standards for existing coal- or gas-fired steam generating units must be based on the use of either CCS (long-term) or natural gas co-firing (medium-term), or exempt from the rule via early retirement, and the standards for new combustion turbines must be based on CCS (base load), efficient simple cycle design (intermediate load), or lower-emitting fuels (low load). Over a dozen states, several industry groups and some power companies and labor unions have filed challenges to the rule at the DC Circuit. On July 19, 2024, the DC Circuit ruled that petitioners had not met the stringent requirements for a stay of the rules. Attorney generals in 25 states sent an emergency appeal to the US Supreme Court asking it to stay the final rule. On October 16, 2024, the US Supreme Court denied the petitioners request for stay. The final rule will remain in effect pending resolution of the ongoing challenges in the DC Circuit and any subsequent appeal to the US Supreme Court. The DC Circuit has scheduled oral argument for December 6, 2024, and indicated that it will decide the challenges during its 2024 term. 
 
 On March 26, 2024, EPA announced it was opening a non-regulatory docket and issued framing questions to gather input about ways to design a stronger, more durable approach to GHG regulation of existing gas combustion turbines. The docket was open for public comment from March 26 to May 28, 2024 and the agency held a policy forum to bring shareholders together to share ideas with EPA and others. The agency has indicated that it plans to issue a new proposal by December 2024. 
 
 In 2021, President Biden signed an executive order Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis, which instructs agency heads to review all Trump Administration actions for inconsistency with the Biden Administration s policy to listen to the science; to improve public health and protect our environment; to ensure access to clean air and water; to limit exposure to dangerous chemicals and pesticides; to hold polluters accountable, including those who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities; to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; to bolster resilience to the impacts of climate change; to restore and expand our national treasures and monuments; and to prioritize both environmental justice and the creation of the well-paying union jobs necessary to deliver on these goals. Agency heads were directed to consider suspending, revising or rescinding any action that is inconsistent with the stated policy. Within 30 days of the executive order, agency heads submitted to the United States Office of Management and Budget OMB a preliminary list of those actions being considered for suspension, revision or rescission that would be completed by December 31, 2021, and would be subject to OMB review. Within 90 days of the executive order, agency heads submitted to OMB an updated list of such actions that would be completed by December 31, 2025. 
 
 Federal Legislation 
 
 President Biden has indicated that climate change is a top priority for his administration. On April 22, 2021, at the Earth Day Summit, as part of the U.S. re-entry into the Paris Agreement, President Biden unveiled the goal to cut U.S. emissions by 50 - 52 from 2005 levels by 2030, nearly double the GHG emissions reduction target set by the Obama Administration. The 2030 goal joins President Biden s other climate goals which include a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. 
 
 In 2022, President Biden signed the IRA providing nearly 370 billion in climate action over the next decade. The legislation is aimed at reducing carbon emissions by investing in a variety of efforts, including tax credits for renewables, battery storage, carbon capture, and electric vehicle sales. 
 
 State and Regional Activity 
 
 Pursuant to New Mexico law, each utility must submit an IRP to the NMPRC every three years to evaluate renewable energy, energy efficiency, load management, distributed generation, and conventional supply-side resources on a consistent and comparable basis. The IRP is required to take into consideration risk and uncertainty of fuel supply, price volatility, and costs of anticipated environmental regulations when evaluating resource options to meet supply needs of the utility s customers. The 
 107 

Table of Contents 

 NMPRC requires that New Mexico utilities factor a standardized cost of carbon emissions into their IRPs using prices ranging between 8 and 40 per metric ton of CO 2 emitted and escalating these costs by 2.5 per year. Under the NMPRC order, each utility must analyze these standardized prices as projected operating costs. Reflecting the evolving nature of this issue, the NMPRC order states that these prices may be changed in the future to account for additional information or changed circumstances. Although these prices may not reflect the costs that ultimately will be incurred, PNM is required to use these prices for purposes of its IRP. PNM s 2023 filing has a continued focus on a carbon-free energy system by 2040. The plan highlights the need for the significant sustained addition of resources over the next two decades, replacing retiring or expiring capacity, meeting concurrent load growth, while reducing the carbon intensity of PNM s portfolio. See Note 12. 
 
 The ETA was signed into New Mexico state law and became effective in 2019. The ETA, among other things, requires that investor-owned utilities obtain specified percentages of their energy from renewable and carbon-free resources. The ETA requires utilities operating in New Mexico to have renewable portfolios equal to 40 by 2025, 50 by 2030, 80 by 2040, and 100 zero-carbon energy by 2045. Under the ETA provisions, PNM will also be required to meet a generation emission standard of no more than 400 lbs. of CO 2 per MWh beginning in 2023 and not more than 200 lbs. per MWh beginning in 2032. PNM takes this requirement into account in its resource planning, and it is expected that the standards will be met with the approved resource retirements and replacements. The ETA provides for a transition from fossil-fuel generating resources to renewable and other carbon-free resources by allowing investor-owned utilities to issue securitized bonds, or energy transition bonds, related to the retirement of coal-fired generating facilities to qualified investors. See additional discussion of the ETA in Note 11. 
 
 The ETA has a significant impact on PNM s future generation portfolio. In 2022, in compliance with the ETA, the NMED announced a new rulemaking, Carbon Dioxide Emission Standards for Electric Generating Facilities, to develop carbon emission standards for new and existing electric coal-fired generating facilities. In 2022, the rule was passed which adopts new carbon emission standards for new and existing coal-fired power plants. 
 
 In 2020, the NMPRC approved PNM s San Juan abandonment application and for the issuance of Securitized Bonds consistent with the requirements of the ETA and in 2023 PNM issued Securitized Bonds. PNM cannot predict the full impact of the ETA with respect to Four Corners. See additional discussion of PNM s Four Corners Abandonment Application in Note 12. 
 
 International Accords 
 
 The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC is an international environmental treaty that was negotiated at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (informally known as the Earth Summit) and entered into force in March 1994. The objective of the treaty is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Parties to the UNFCCC, including the U.S., have been meeting annually in Conferences of the Parties COP to assess progress in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC. 
 
 In 2015, the Paris Agreement was finalized during the 2015 COP. The aim of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement, which was agreed to by approximately 200 parties, requires that countries submit INDCs. INDCs reflect national targets and actions that arise out of national policies and elements relating to oversight, guidance and coordination of actions to reduce emissions by all countries. In November 2014, then President Obama announced the United States commitment to reduce GHG, on an economy-wide basis, by 26 -28 from 2005 levels by the year 2025. The U.S. INDC was part of an overall effort by the former administration to have the U.S. achieve economy-wide reductions of around 80 by 2050. The former administration s GHG reduction target for the electric utility industry was a key element of its INDC and was based on EPA s GHG regulations for new, existing, and modified and reconstructed sources at that time. Thresholds for the number of countries necessary to ratify or accede to the Paris Agreement and total global GHG percentage were achieved on October 5, 2016 and the Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. In 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. As a result of the President s notice to the United Nations, the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an instrument that will allow the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The instrument was deposited with the United Nations on January 21, 2021, and the United States officially became a party to the Agreement on February 19, 2021. 
 
 PNM has calculated GHG reductions that would result from scenarios that capture PNM s retirement of its share of the SJGS in 2022 and assume exiting Four Corners in 2031 and PNM has set a goal to have a 100 carbon-free generating portfolio by 2040. While the Company has not conducted an independent 2 Degree Scenario analysis, our commitment to becoming 100 carbon-free by 2040 produces a carbon emissions reduction pathway that tracks within the ranges of climate scenario pathways that are consistent with limiting the global warming average to less than 2 degrees Celsius. In addition, as an investor-owned utility operating in the state of New Mexico, PNM is required to comply with the ETA, which requires utilities generating portfolio be 100 carbon-free by 2045. The requirements of the ETA and the Company s goal compare favorably to the U.S. INDC of 50 to 52 carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and the Biden Administration s goal of net-zero carbon 
 108 

Table of Contents 

 emissions economy-wide by 2050. On April 1, 2020, the NMPRC approved PNM s application to retire its share of SJGS in 2022. 
 
 PNM will continue to monitor the United States participation in the Paris Agreement and other parties involvement in these types of international accords, but the potential impact that such accords may have on the Company cannot be determined at this time. 
 
 Assessment of Legislative/Regulatory Impacts 
 
 The Company has assessed, and continues to assess, the impacts of climate change legislation and regulation on its business. This assessment is ongoing and future changes arising out of the legislative or regulatory process could impact the assessment significantly. PNM s assessment includes assumptions regarding specific GHG limits; the timing of implementation of these limits; the possibility of a market-based trading program, including the associated costs and the availability of emission credits or allowances; the development of emission reduction and/or renewable energy technologies; and provisions for cost containment. Moreover, the assessment assumes various market reactions such as the price of coal and gas and regional plant economics. These assumptions are, at best, preliminary and speculative. However, based upon these assumptions, the enactment of climate change legislation or regulation could, among other things, result in significant compliance costs, including large capital expenditures by PNM, and could jeopardize the Company s reputation as well as the economic viability of certain generating facilities. The ultimate consequences of increased stakeholder scrutiny related to climate change and environmental regulation could lead to increased costs to customers and affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if the incurred costs are not fully recovered through regulated rates. Higher rates could also contribute to reduced usage of electricity. PNM s assessment process is evolving and is too speculative at this time for a meaningful prediction of the long-term financial impact. 
 
 Transmission Issues 
 
 At any given time, FERC has various notices of inquiry and rulemaking dockets related to transmission issues pending. Such actions may lead to changes in FERC administrative rules or ratemaking policy but have no time frame in which action must be taken or a docket closed with no further action. Further, such notices and rulemaking dockets do not apply strictly to PNM but will have industry-wide effects in that they will apply to all FERC-regulated entities. PNM monitors and often submits comments taking a position in such notices and rulemaking dockets or may join in larger group responses. PNM often cannot determine the full impact of a proposed rule and policy change until the final determination is made by FERC and PNM is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 See Notes 11 and 12 herein and Notes 16 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of commitments and contingencies and rate and regulatory matters. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires Company management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the results of operations and financial position for TXNM, PNM, and TNMP. The selection and application of those policies requires management to make difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. As a result, there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes with regard to the critical accounting policies disclosed in TXNM s, PNM s, and TNMP s 2023 Annual Reports on Forms 10-K. The policies disclosed included regulatory accounting, impairments, decommissioning and reclamation costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, accounting for contingencies, and income taxes.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The Company manages the scope of its various forms of market risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures with oversight by senior level management through the Risk Management Committee RMC ). The Board s Finance Committee sets the risk limit parameters. The RMC has oversight over the risk control organization. The RMC is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures, and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions on an enterprise-wide basis. 
 
 111 

Table of Contents 

 The RMC s responsibilities include: 
 
 Establishing policies regarding risk tolerance levels and activities in each of the business segments 
 Approving new types of derivatives entered into for marketing and hedging 
 Reviewing and approving hedging risk activities 
 Establishing policies regarding counterparty credit exposure and limits 
 Authorizing and delegating transaction limits 
 Reviewing and approving controls and procedures for derivative activities 
 Reviewing and approving models and assumptions used to calculate mark-to-market and market risk exposure 
 Proposing risk limits to the Board s Finance Committee for its approval 
 Reporting to the Board s Audit and Finance Committees on these activities 
 
 To the extent an open position exists, fluctuating commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices, and economic conditions can impact financial results and financial position, either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, the Company cannot predict with certainty the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses, operating results, or financial position. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 Information concerning accounting for derivatives and the risks associated with commodity contracts is set forth in Note 7, including a summary of the fair values of mark-to-market energy related derivative contracts included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had no commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 
 Commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effects of mark-to-market commodity derivative instruments had no impact to PNM s net earnings and 0.8 million of fair value losses and 6.5 million of fair value gains have been recorded as a regulatory asset. All of the fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were determined based on prices provided by external sources other than actively quoted market prices. The net mark-to-market amounts as of September 30, 2024 were zero. 
 The Company manages risks associated with market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps. PNM uses such instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in the market prices of electricity and natural gas. PNM also uses such instruments under an NMPRC approved hedging plan to manage fuel and purchased power costs related to customers covered by its FPPAC. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk from its retail and wholesale customers, as well as the counterparties to derivative instruments. The Company conducts counterparty risk analysis across business segments and uses a credit management process to assess the financial conditions of counterparties. The following table provides information related to credit exposure by the credit worthiness (credit rating) and concentration of credit risk for wholesale counterparties, all of which will mature in less than two years. 
 Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure 
 September 30, 2024 Rating (1) 
 Credit Risk Exposure (2) 
 Number of Counter-parties >10 Net Exposure of Counter-parties >10 (Dollars in thousands) External ratings: Investment grade 1,174 1 1,005 Non-investment grade Split ratings Internal ratings: Investment grade 1,699 1 1,607 Non-investment grade Total 2,873 2,612 
 
 (1) The rating Investment Grade is for counterparties, or a guarantor, with a minimum S P rating of BBB- or Moody s rating of Baa3. The category Internal Ratings Investment Grade includes those counterparties that are internally rated as investment grade in accordance with the guidelines established in the Company s credit policy. 
 (2) The Credit Risk Exposure is the gross credit exposure, including long-term contracts, forward sales, and short-term sales. The gross exposure captures the amounts from receivables/payables for realized transactions, delivered and 
 112 

Table of Contents 

 unbilled revenues, and mark-to-market gains/losses. Gross exposures can be offset according to legally enforceable netting arrangements but are not reduced by posted credit collateral. At September 30, 2024, TXNM held 0.2 million of cash collateral to offset its credit exposure. 
 
 Net credit risk for the Company s largest counterparty as of September 30, 2024, was 1.6 million. 
 
 Other investments have no significant counterparty credit risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The majority of PNM s and TNMP s long-term debt is fixed-rate debt, which does not expose earnings to adverse changes in market interest rates. PNM and TNMP earnings are exposed to adverse changes in market interest rates when long-term debt must be refinanced, repriced or redeemed. TXNM s debt and the revolving credit facilities of PNM and TNMP are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent variable interest rates continue to rise. The Company periodically makes plans to reduce its variable interest rate exposures through various instruments including fixed rate debt and equity and hedging arrangements like those executed by TXNM in 2022 and 2023, and otherwise expects that it will be able to extend or replace variable rate debt under similar terms and conditions prior to their expirations. Variable interest rates under the TXNM, PNM, and TNMP revolving credit facilities and term loans are based on SOFR. 
 
 At October 25, 2024, variable rate debt balances and weighted average interest rates were as follows: 
 
 Variable Rate Debt Weighted Average Interest Rate Balance Outstanding Capacity (In thousands) Short-term Debt: TXNM Revolving Credit Facility 
 6.44 173,600 300,000 PNM Revolving Credit Facility 6.14 182,000 400,000 PNM New Mexico Credit Facility 40,000 TNMP Revolving Credit Facility 5.80 112,500 200,000 468,100 940,000 Long-term Debt: TXNM 2021 Delayed-Draw Term Loan 
 5.90 51,000 TXNM 2023 Term Loan 
 6.30 410,000 PNM 2024 Term Loan 
 5.80 200,000 661,000 
 
 The investments held by PNM in trusts for decommissioning and reclamation had an estimated fair value of 453.5 million at September 30, 2024, of which 15.7 were fixed-rate debt securities that subject PNM to risk of loss of fair value with increases in market interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points from their levels at September 30, 2024, the decrease in the fair value of the fixed-rate securities would be 1.1 , or 0.8 million. 
 
 PNM does not directly recover or return through rates any losses or gains on the securities, including equity investments discussed below, in the trusts for decommissioning and reclamation. However, the overall performance of these trusts does enter into the periodic determinations of expense and funding levels, which are factored into the rate making process to the extent applicable to regulated operations. PNM is at risk for shortfalls in funding of obligations due to investment losses, including those from the equity market risks discussed below, to the extent not ultimately recovered through rates charged to customers. 
 
 Equity Market Risk 
 
 The investments held by PNM in trusts for decommissioning and reclamation include certain equity securities at September 30, 2024. These equity securities expose PNM to losses in fair value should the market values of the underlying securities decline. Equity securities comprised 55.8 of the securities held by the trusts as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 10 decrease in equity prices would reduce the fair values of these funds by 25.3 million. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of TXNM, PNM, and TNMP conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the 
 113 

Chief Financial Officer of each of TXNM, PNM, and TNMP concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in each of TXNM s, PNM s, and TNMP s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, each of TXNM s, PNM s, and TNMP s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes with regard to the Risk Factors disclosed in TXNM s, PNM s, and TNMP s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. 
 The impact of wildfires could negatively affect PNM s and TNMP s results of operations. 
 
 PNM and TNMP have large networks of electric transmission and distribution facilities. Weather conditions including severe drought, high winds, and the natural vegetation in the U.S. Southwest region and certain parts of Texas, could contribute to wildfires in or near PNM s and TNMP s service territories. The risk of wildfires could result in higher maintenance costs, increased insurance premiums, and the inability to maintain adequate insurance coverage. PNM and TNMP take proactive steps to mitigate wildfire risk. However, wildfire risk is always present and PNM and TNMP could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires caused, or allegedly caused, by their transmission and distribution systems. In addition, wildfires could cause damage to PNM s and TNMP s assets that could result in loss of service to customers or make it difficult to supply power in sufficient quantities to meet customer needs. Wildfire avoidance measures, such as intentional power interruptions, also may lead to customer claims for lost service, business interruption, and other injuries. 
 
 Failure to adequately address the risk of wildfires could also result in civil liability arising out of government enforcement actions or private claims. These actions could also result in reputational harm, which may cause stock price decreases, increased insurance premiums or the inability to maintain adequate insurance coverage, or cause certain investors and financial institutions not to purchase the Company s debt securities or otherwise provide the Company with capital or credit on favorable terms, which may cause the cost of capital to increase. In addition, TXNM and its operating subsidiaries may underestimate the costs of litigation due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters. These events could have negative impacts on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 TXNM and its subsidiaries substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition. 
 
 TXNM and its subsidiaries currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes. This significant amount of indebtedness could limit TXNM s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, stock repurchases or other purposes. It may also increase TXNM s vulnerability to adverse economic, market and industry conditions, limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business operations or to its industry overall, and place TXNM at a disadvantage in relation to its competitors that have lower debt levels. Any or all of the above events and/or factors could have an adverse effect on TXNM s results of operations and financial condition. 

114 

Servicing TXNM and its subsidiaries debt requires a significant amount of cash, and it may not have sufficient cash flow from its business to pay its substantial debt. 
 
 TXNM and its subsidiaries ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance, its indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, depends on its future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond its control. TXNM s business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service its debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If TXNM is unable to generate such cash flow, TXNM may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. TXNM s ability to refinance its indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. TXNM may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on its debt obligations. 
 
 Despite TXNM s current consolidated debt levels, TXNM and its subsidiaries may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above. 
 
 Despite TXNM s current consolidated debt levels, TXNM and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in its debt instruments, some of which may be senior indebtedness or secured debt. TXNM is not restricted under the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing its debt or taking a number of other actions. TXNM s Credit Agreement restricts its ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the TXNM Credit Agreement matures or is repaid, TXNM may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness. 
 
 The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect TXNM s financial condition and operating results. 
 
 In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, to the extent TXNM is required to pay cash to settle a portion of its conversion obligation, it could adversely affect TXNM s liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, to the extent TXNM is required to pay cash to settle a portion of its conversion obligations, TXNM would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of its net working capital. 
 
 The accounting method for the Convertible Notes could have a material effect on TXNM s reported financial results. 
 
 In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which amends the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. ASU 2020-06 eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments and eliminates the ability to use the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Instead, ASU 2020-06 requires (i) the entire amount of the security to be presented as a liability on the balance sheet and (ii) application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will generally be calculated assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which could adversely affect TXNM s diluted earnings per share. However, if the principal amount of the convertible debt security, such as the Convertible Notes, being converted is required to be paid in cash and only the excess is permitted to be settled in shares, the if-converted method will produce a similar result as the treasury stock method prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 for such convertible debt security. 
 
 ASU 2020-06 became effective for TXNM as of the start of fiscal year end 2022 and as such TXNM did not bifurcate the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes on its balance sheet and TXNM used the if-converted method of calculating diluted earnings per share. To the extent TXNM is required to pay cash to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion, with only the excess permitted to be settled in shares of TXNM s common stock, the application of the if-converted method will produce a similar result as the treasury stock method prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06. The effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. The requirement that the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion must be paid in cash could adversely affect TXNM s liquidity. 
 
 TXNM cannot be sure whether other changes may be made to the current accounting standards related to the Convertible Notes, or otherwise, that could have a material effect on its reported financial results. 
 
 115 

The fundamental change repurchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to acquire TXNM. 
 
 Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire TXNM. For example, the Convertible Notes Indenture requires TXNM, subject to certain exceptions, to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture). A takeover of TXNM may trigger the requirement that TXNM repurchase the Convertible Notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of TXNM that would otherwise be beneficial to investors. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined by Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
