 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share and, to certain investors in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a public offering price of per pre-funded warrant in an underwritten public offering. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share public offering price for the common stock, minus the per share exercise price of each such pre-funded warrant. Aggregate net proceeds were million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The pre-funded warrants were classified as a component of permanent stockholders equity within additional paid-in capital and were recorded at the issuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. The pre-funded warrants are equity classified because they (i) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, (ii) are immediately exercisable, (iii) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (iv) permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (v) are indexed to the Company s common stock and (vi) meet the equity classification criteria. In addition, such pre-funded warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The Company valued the pre-funded warrants at issuance, concluding that their sales price approximated their fair value, and allocated net proceeds from the sale proportionately to the common stock and pre-funded warrants, of which million was allocated to the pre-funded warrants and recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital. No pre-funded warrants have been exercised as of September 30, 2024 .

At September 30, 2024, the Company had available-for-sale marketable securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and the Company believes it is more likely than not that marketable securities in an unrealized loss position will be held until maturity and that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

In February 2021, shares were authorized for issuance under the 2021 Plan, which shall be cumulatively increased on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in 2031 equal to the lesser of (i) the amount equal to of the number of shares issued and outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii) such lower number of shares as may be determined by the Company s board of directors. The 2021 Plan is the successor to the 2017 Incentive Award Plan and additional awards may be issued from the 2017 Plan. However, the 2017 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under this plan. Shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2017 Plan that are forfeited or lapse unexercised and which following the effective date of the 2021 Plan are not issued under the 2017 Plan will be available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The number of authorized shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan was increased by shares effective as of January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock were available for future grants under the 2021 Plan. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2021 ESPP) was approved by the Company s board of directors in January 2021. In February 2021, a total of shares were initially reserved for issuance under this plan, which shall be cumulatively increased on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in 2031 equal to the lesser of (i) of the shares outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) such number of shares as may be determined by the Company s board of directors . The number of authorized shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 ESPP was increased by shares effective as of January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock were available for future grants under the 2021 ESPP. Under the 2021 ESPP, eligible employees may select a rate of payroll deduction up to of their eligible compensation subject to certain maximum purchase limitations. The duration for each offering period is 24 months and is divided into four purchase periods of approximately six months in length. Offerings are concurrent. The purchase price of the shares under the offering is the lesser of of the fair market value of the shares on the offering date or of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date. A look-back feature in the 2021 ESPP causes the offering period to automatically reset if the fair value of the Company s common stock on the last day of the purchase period is less than that on the original offering date. 2021 ESPP purchases by employees are settled with newly-issued common stock from the 2021 ESPP s previously authorized and available pool of shares. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested employee stock purchases. The unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is estimated to be recognized over a period of years as of September 30, 2024. There were and shares purchased by employees under the 2021 ESPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2022 Employment Inducement Award Plan In September 2022, the Company's compensation committee approved the 2022 Inducement Plan which authorized shares of common stock to be issued and permitted the granting of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards to newly hired employees and office rs. In August 2024 and September 2023, the Company approved amendments to the 2022 Inducement Plan which increased the number of authorized shares reserved for issuance by and shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, shares of the Company's common stock were available for future grants under the 2022 Inducement Plan.

shares of common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share public offering price for the common stock sold in the same offering, minus the per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. As of September 30, 2024, no pre-funded warrants have been exercised. In August 2022, the Company sold pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per pre-funded warrant. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share offering price for the common stock, minus the per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. As of September 30, 2024, pre-funded warrants have been exercised. Stock Options Stock options granted to employees and non-employees under the plans generally vest over four years and allow the holder of the option to purchase common stock at a stated exercise price. Options granted under the plans generally expire ten years after the date of grant. The Company recognizes the stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company s common stock for those stock options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options which is estimated to be recognized over a period of years. Restricted Stock Units with Service Conditions RSUs with service conditions granted to employees under the plans generally vest over four years. The number of shares issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory tax withholdings, which are paid in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of the Company s employees. The Company recognizes the stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. In addition to historical financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our fiscal year ends on December 31 each year. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology and obesity. Our programs are based on mechanisms of action that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials in indications with significant unmet medical needs. We are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver improved clinical outcomes in the target indication as either single-agent or combination therapies. The most advanced product candidates in our pipeline TERN-701, TERN-601 and TERN-501 were internally discovered. Additionally, we have an ongoing discovery effort for the TERN-800 series of small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators for obesity, which have the potential to be combined with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. 
 TERN-701 is our proprietary, oral, potent, allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor. Allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors are a novel class of therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that has demonstrated superior efficacy and safety compared to traditional active-site tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In April 2024, we announced that in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study, pharmacokinetic (PK) data showed no clinically significant difference in exposure between fed and fasted dosing. The ability to dose without regard to food represents a key potential differentiator within the allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor class. Across the dose ranges administered to date (20 mg to 160 mg), TERN-701 PK was linear with a median half-life ranging from 8 to 12 hours. At the 80 mg and 160 mg doses, TERN-701 exposures over 24 hours met or exceeded the predicted efficacious concentrations based on preclinical data, consistent with observed clinical activity and safety at these doses in the ongoing clinical trial conducted by our partner, Hansoh. Additionally, the PK profile of TERN-701 in Western participants was generally consistent with that observed in the Phase 1 clinical study in Chinese CML patients. Enrollment of our global Phase 1 trial, the CARDINAL trial, continues and includes sites from the United States, Europe and other countries. We expect interim data from initial cohorts in the CARDINAL trial in early December 2024. TERN-701 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of CML in March 2024. 
 TERN-601 is our small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist program that is intended to be orally administered for obesity. In September 2024, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 1 trial of TERN-601. The Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single and multiple-ascending dose (SAD and MAD) trial in healthy adults with obesity or overweight. The primary endpoint of the trial was to evaluate safety and tolerability of TERN-601 administered once-daily (QD) for 28 days. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, efficacy as measured by body weight loss following 28 days of treatment with TERN-601, and other exploratory markers. The clinical trial results showed TERN-601 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent, statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean weight loss across all three doses evaluated in the 28-day MAD study, with maximum placebo-adjusted mean weight loss of 4.9 (p 95 of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were mild. All gastrointestinal events were mild to moderate and consistent with the GLP-1R agonist class. Importantly, there were no clinically meaningful changes in liver enzymes, vital signs or electrocardiograms observed. The absence of treatment-related dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuations with mostly mild AEs, despite aggressive titration to high doses in this 28-day study, indicates potential for further improved tolerability in subsequent studies with slower titration. Terns plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in early second quarter of 2025 with initial 12-week data expected in the second half of 2025. The trial will begin with a 12-week portion to optimize dose titration and inform subsequent cohorts. 
 TERN-501 is our thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR- agonist initially developed for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) for which we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2a DUET trial in August 2023. We have decided to limit spend in MASH given the current regulatory and clinical development requirements for the indication. We continue to evaluate opportunities for TERN-501 in metabolic diseases. Based on non-clinical studies, THR- is an orthogonal mechanism to GLP-1, potentially providing broader metabolic and liver benefits in addition to increased weight loss. In June 2024, we highlighted preclinical data supporting TERN-501 in combination with a GLP-1R agonist for obesity at the American Diabetes Association 84th Scientific Sessions. TERN-501 significantly improved the efficacy of a GLP-1 receptor agonist in an obese mouse model by normalizing energy expenditure, resulting in greater weight loss, increased fat mass loss and relative preservation of lean mass compared to the GLP-1R agonist alone. 
 19 

The TERN-800 series is our ongoing discovery efforts to discover small molecule GIPR modulators for obesity, which we believe has the potential for combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists. We are prioritizing our discovery efforts towards nominating a GIPR antagonist development candidate based on in-house discoveries and growing scientific rationale supporting the potential of GLP-1 receptor agonist and GIPR antagonist combinations for obesity. 
 Since the commencement of our operations, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations.

Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated, and do not expect to generate for the foreseeable future, any revenue from the sale of products. We may generate revenue from pre-specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones as part of an exclusive option and license agreement for TERN-701 in greater China with Hansoh. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts, and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Costs for certain activities, such as manufacturing and preclinical studies and clinical trials, are generally recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and collaborators. 
 
 External expenses include: 
 expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including those incurred under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and CROs; 

the cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and consultants; 

the costs of funding research performed by third-party vendors for performing preclinical testing on our behalf; 

the costs of purchasing lab supplies and non-capital equipment used in designing, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

costs associated with consultants for chemistry, manufacturing and controls development, regulatory, statistics and other services; 

20 

expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and 

expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or in-licensing of assets from other parties. 

Internal expenses include: 
 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in research and development functions. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and discovery as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities; and 

other expenses include rent, depreciation, maintenance and allocated overhead.

The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 0.7 million increase in clinical and preclinical program expenses, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in personnel-related expenses. 
 The increase in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 4.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses and a 1.7 million increase in clinical and preclinical program expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and tax services. 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 8.6 million decrease in personnel-related expenses. 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 8.4 million decrease in personnel-related expenses and a 0.2 million decrease in expenses primarily related to insurance costs. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income primarily consists of interest income on our cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million, compared to 3.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities. 
 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.1 million, compared to 9.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities. 
 21 

Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was less than 0.1 million. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.1 million. 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.2 million. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Uses of cash 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures and general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2028, including key clinical data readouts from our lead programs in CML and obesity. However, we continue to anticipate that our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will remain significant to support our ongoing and planned activities. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years. 
 Sources of liquidity 
 We have primarily funded our operations through proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 399.7 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 372.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of approximately 67.1 million and negative cash flows from operations of approximately 55.4 million. 
 
 In March 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (Cowen), as sales agent, pursuant to which we have the ability to offer and sell, from time to time, through Cowen, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million in an at-the-market offering. The shares are offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which became effective in March 2022. As of September 30, 2024, there were 9,781,673 shares of our common stock sold for aggregate net proceeds of 66.6 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses pursuant to this agreement. 
 
 In May 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen, as sales agent, pursuant to which we have the ability to offer and sell, from time to time, through Cowen, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million in an at-the-market offering. The shares are offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which became effective in February 2023. There were no sales of our common stock pursuant to this agreement through September 30, 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, we issued 14,064,048 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 10.50 per share and, to certain investors in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,380,952 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 10.4999 per pre-funded warrant in an underwritten public offering. The purchase price per share of each pre-funded warrant represents the per share public offering price for the common stock, minus the 0.0001 per share exercise price of such pre-funded warrant. Aggregate net proceeds were 161.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. We will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities. 
 22 

Future funding requirements 
 We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will remain significant for the foreseeable future in connection with conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future research programs and product candidates, contracting with CROs and CMOs to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. 
 Our primary uses of cash are to fund our research and development activities, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to any approved products, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
 Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

 Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, management, with the supervision and participation of our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
