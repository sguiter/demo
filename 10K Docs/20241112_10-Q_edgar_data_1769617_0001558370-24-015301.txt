 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, available-for-sale debt securities with a fair value of million were pledged for the BTFP borrowing, and available-for-sale debt securities with a fair value of million and held-to-maturity securities with a fair value of million were pledged as collateral to provide borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve s Discount Window.

Unrealized losses on debt securities may occur from current market conditions, increases in interest rates since the time of purchase, a structural change in an investment, volatility of earnings of a specific issuer, or deterioration in credit quality of the issuer. Management evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess whether an impairment exists. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s security portfolio consisted of debt securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. The unrealized losses are primarily related to the Company s debt securities that were issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 represent a credit loss impairment. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities.

 ACL was recorded at September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024, the held-to-maturity securities were U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations. These securities are guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprise with a long history of no credit losses, and Management has determined these securities to have a zero loss expectation and therefore does not estimate an ACL on these securities. Loans held for sale, contractual principal outstanding Fair value less unpaid principal balance The Company has elected the fair value option for mortgage loans held for sale to better match changes in fair value of the loans with changes in the fair value of the forward sale commitment contracts used to economically hedge them. Changes in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale accounted for under the fair value option election amounted to an increase of and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to , compared to a decrease of and in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These amounts are offset in earnings by the changes in fair value of forward sale commitments. The changes in fair value are reported as a component of gain on sale of mortgage loans in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were loans held for sale that were greater than 90 days past due.

 The financial effect of the modifications to loans in the commercial real estate category was a reduced weighted-average contractual rate from to , and the financial effect of the modification to the loan in the commercial and industrial category was an additional years to the life of the loan. There were material loan modifications based on borrower financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. As of September 30, 2024, modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty had a current payment status. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a payment default and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default. Default is determined at 90 or more days past due, upon charge-off, or upon foreclosure. Modified loans in default are individually evaluated for the allowance for credit losses or if the modified loan is deemed uncollectible, the loan, or a portion of the loan, is written off, and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly. Credit Quality Indicators Commercial The Company uses a -grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, commercial construction and commercial loans, as follows: Loans rated 1 6 are considered pass -rated loans with low to average risk. Loans rated 7 are considered special mention. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by Management. Loans rated 8 are considered substandard. Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.

 billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company accounts for MSRs at fair value. The Company obtains and reviews valuations from an independent third party to determine the fair value of MSRs. Key assumptions used in the estimation of fair value include prepayment speeds, discount rates, and default rates . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following weighted average assumptions were used in the calculation of fair value of MSRs: Discount rate Default rate The following summarizes changes to MSRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Additions Changes in fair value due to: Reductions from loans paid off during the period ) ) ) ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions ) ) Balance, end of period Contractually specified servicing fees, net of subservicing expense, included in other mortgage banking income amounted to million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. million as of both dates. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2023, it was determined that HarborOne Mortgage s goodwill was impaired, and a million goodwill impairment charge was recorded for the period ended December 31, 2023. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 31 or on an interim basis if an event triggering impairment may have occurred. As of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed whether there were additional events or changes in circumstances since its annual goodwill impairment test that would indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the reporting unit s carrying amount that would require an interim impairment assessment after October 31, 2023. The Company determined there had been no such indicators, therefore, interim goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2024 was performed. The process of evaluating fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment and estimates. The goodwill at the Bank is at risk of future impairment in the event of a sustained decline in the value of its stock as well as

 million, designated as fair value portfolio layer hedges. The Company receives variable-rate interest payments in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts. The gain or loss on these derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in interest income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million that were designated as a fair value hedge of fixed-rate residential mortgages. The hedges were determined to be effective during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the Company expects the hedges to remain effective during the remaining terms of the swaps.

At September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was billion; the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was million and the amount of the designated hedged items were million. Cashflow Hedge - As part of its interest-rate risk-management strategy, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to help manage its interest-rate risk positions. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent the amount exchanged by the parties. The exchange of cash flows is determined by reference to the notional amounts and the other terms of the interest rate swap agreements. The changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cashflow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings when gains or losses are realized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that was designated as a cashflow hedge of brokered deposits. The interest rate swap agreement has an average maturity of years, the current weighted average fixed rate paid is , the weighted average 3-month SOFR swap receive rate is , and the fair value is million. The Company expects approximately million related to the cashflow hedge to be reclassified to interest expense, from other comprehensive income, in the next twelve months. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Derivative Loan Commitments - Mortgage loan commitments qualify as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held for sale upon funding. The Company enters into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future, with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market. A mortgage loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, generally up to after inception of the rate lock. Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose the Company to the risk that the price of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitment might decline from inception of a rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates. If interest rates increase, the value of these loan commitments decreases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increases. Forward Loan Sale Commitments -The Company utilizes both mandatory delivery and best efforts forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loans that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments. With a mandatory delivery contract, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. If the Company fails to deliver the number of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, it is obligated to pay a pair-off fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall. With a best efforts contract, the Company commits to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, the price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded (e.g., on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower).

 Level 1 securities held at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Level 2 debt securities are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments. The fair value of these securities is determined using matrix pricing with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category includes obligations of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, including mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. Debt securities not actively traded whose fair value is determined through the use of cash flows utilizing inputs that are unobservable are classified as Level 3. There were Level 3 securities held at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Loans held for sale - The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is estimated based on current market prices for similar loans in the secondary market and therefore are classified as Level 2 assets. There were mortgage loans held for sale 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans - The fair value of collateral-dependent loans that are deemed to be impaired is determined based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business assets. For collateral-dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the sale of the collateral, Management adjusts the fair value for estimated costs to sell. For collateral-dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the operation of the collateral, estimated costs to sell are not incorporated into the measurement. Management may also adjust appraised values to reflect estimated market value declines or apply other discounts to appraised values resulting from its knowledge of the property. Internal valuations are utilized to determine the fair value of other business assets. Collateral-dependent impaired loans are categorized as Level 3. Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, the Company reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. Retirement plan annuities - The carrying value of the annuities are based on their contract values which approximate fair value.

 and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements - The Company s interest rate swaps are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For these interest rate derivatives, fair value is determined by a third party utilizing models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as swap rates and yield curves. The pricing models used to value interest rate swaps calculate the sum of each instrument s fixed and variable cash flows, which are then discounted using an appropriate yield curve to arrive at the fair value of each swap. The pricing models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the methodologies used do not require significant judgment. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with interest rate contracts and risk participation agreements utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company classified its derivative valuations in their entirety as Level 2. Interest rate futures The Company s interest rate futures are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable and as a result, the Company has classified these derivatives as Level 2. Off-balance sheet credit-related instruments - Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit standing. The fair value of off-balance sheet instruments is immaterial. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period, if applicable. There were transfers during the periods presented.

The table below presents quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at the dates indicated. Sales Comparison Approach (1) (1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which includes unobservable inputs such as adjustments for differences between the comparable sales. The Company may also use another source of collateral assessment to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the collateral. Appraisals may be adjusted by Management for qualitative factors and estimated liquidation expenses. Generally, appraisals for residential real estate loans are discounted while commercial real estate loan appraisals are discounted - . Commercial and industrial appraisals are generally discounted - . Management may take larger discounts to reflect market liquidity for certain types of assets not addressed in the appraisals.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Modifications to significant accounting policies made during the year are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies, which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, require Management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management has identified the Company s most critical accounting policies as related to: Allowance for Credit Losses Goodwill Deferred Tax Assets The accounting policies and estimates, including the nature of the estimates and types of assumptions used, are described in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Company s most recent Form 10-K and pertain to discussion in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total Assets. Total assets increased 108.1 million, or 1.9 , to 5.78 billion at September 30, 2024 from 5.67 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects an increase of 129.2 million in loans, partially offset by a 13.4 million decrease in securities available for sale and a 3.9 million decrease in short-term investments. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 3.1 million to 224.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 227.4 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in short-term investments. Assets Held for Sale. The decrease in assets held for sale of 348,000 reflects the sale-leaseback of the building that currently houses HarborOne s Legion Parkway banking center in downtown Brockton. This second quarter 2024 transaction resulted in a gain of 1.8 million recorded in noninterest income, partially offset by the 675,000 bargain purchase element of the property sale included in marketing expense as a contribution. Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale at September 30, 2024 were 28.5 million, an increase of 8.8 million from 19.7 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting increased loan production at HarborOne Mortgage.

Refer to Note 10 - Derivatives . The growth in net loans primarily reflects commercial loan growth. Management continues to seek prudent commercial lending opportunities to deepen relationships with existing customers and develop new relationships with strong borrowers. Securities. Investment securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 were 276.8 million, a decrease of 13.4 million, or 4.6 , from 290.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects the sale of 17.5 million of low-yield securities with a loss on sale of 1.0 million that occurred in the second quarter of 2024. Securities available for sale were negatively impacted by unrealized losses of 52.2 million and 62.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. Securities held to maturity amounted to 19.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 19.8 million at December 31, 2023, with a fair value of 19.5 million and 19.3 million, respectively. Mortgage servicing rights. MSRs are created as a result of our mortgage banking origination activities and accounted for at fair value. At September 30, 2024, we serviced mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 3.43 billion. Total MSRs were 43.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 46.1 million at December 31, 2023. The change in total MSRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects additions of 985,000 from new mortgage originations, amortization from loan repayments of 1.6 million and a negative fair value mark of 2.4 million. Quarterly, we utilize a third-party provider to assist in the determination of the fair value of our MSRs. They provide the appropriate prepayment speed, and discount and default rate assumptions based on our portfolio and key benchmark mortgage rates. Management reviews the assumptions and calculation. Any measurement of fair value is

Table of Contents HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. Management s Discussion and Analysis 
 limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made at a particular point in time. Those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different point in time. The assumptions used in the MSR fair value calculation are significantly impacted by the residential mortgage benchmark indices. Decreasing mortgage rates normally encourages increased mortgage refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the MSRs, thereby reducing the value of MSRs, whereas increasing interest rates would result in increases in fair value, and a corresponding increase in earnings. MSRs recorded during periods of historically low interest rates may be less sensitive to falling rates in the future as they were originated in a low mortgage rate environment. Deposits. Deposits were 4.54 billion and 4.39 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of deposits: 

September 30, December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Dollars Percent (dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing deposits 713,379 659,973 53,406 8.1 NOW accounts 296,315 305,774 (9,459) (3.1) Regular savings 926,192 1,265,315 (339,123) (26.8) Money market accounts 666,132 499,651 166,481 33.3 Term certificate accounts 1,063,164 858,241 204,923 23.9 Consumer and business deposits 3,665,182 3,588,954 76,228 2.1 Municipal deposits 497,313 471,817 25,496 5.4 Brokered deposits 373,682 326,638 47,044 14.4 Total deposits 4,536,177 4,387,409 148,768 3.4 Reciprocal deposits 372,372 209,401 162,971 77.8 Total deposits increased 148.8 million reflecting increases of 47.1 million in brokered deposits, 25.5 million in municipal deposits, and 76.2 million in consumer and business deposits. Brokered deposits provide a channel for the Company to seek additional funding outside the Company s core market. We participate in a reciprocal deposit program that provides access to FDIC-insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding the current limits for depositors. Total deposits included 372.4 million in reciprocal deposits. The increase in reciprocal deposits primarily reflects municipal depositors increased utilization of the reciprocal deposit program, as municipal deposits are generally required to be insured or secured by FHLB letters of credit. The total of estimated deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limits amounted to 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Until February 24, 2023, insurance for deposits in excess of FDIC limits was provided through the DIF. On February 24, 2023, at 5 p.m. local time, the Bank exited DIF. All customer non-certificate deposits as of that date and time were covered by DIF insurance until February 24, 2024. Certificates of deposit as of 5 p.m. local time on February 24, 2023 remain covered by DIF insurance until their maturity date. The following table summarizes uninsured deposits at the date indicated: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Uninsured deposits, per regulatory reporting requirements 1,418,454 1,420,431 Less: Subsidiary deposits 415,809 349,748 Collateralized deposits 211,135 17,892 Uninsured deposits, after exclusions 791,510 1,052,791 Uninsured deposits, after excluding subsidiary deposits and collateralized deposits, represented 17 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Management believes that this provides a more informative view of uninsured deposits, as subsidiary deposits are eliminated in consolidation and collateralized deposits are secured.

 Borrowed Funds. Borrowings decreased 29.1 million to 539.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 568.5 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, FHLB short-term borrowings were 60.0 million and long-term borrowings were 479.4 million. The Company borrowed 175 million for a one-year term under the BTFP during the first quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 1.4 billion in available borrowing capacity across multiple relationships. Stockholders equity . Total stockholders equity was 584.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 583.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 584.6 million at September 30, 2023. Stockholders equity increased 0.1 when compared to the year end, as earnings and a decrease in unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities were partially offset by share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,501,523 shares at an average price of 10.76, including 0.10 per share of excise tax. The tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-assets ratio (non-GAAP) was 9.17 at September 30, 2024, 9.33 at December 31, 2023, and 9.17 at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the capital levels of both the Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements, and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. The capital levels of both the Company and the Bank at September 30, 2024, also exceeded the minimum capital requirements, including the currently applicable capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . Regulatory capital ratios are not impacted by the decline in other comprehensive income as a result of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. Consolidated Overview . Consolidated net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.9 million and 18.5 million, respectively, compared to net income of 8.4 million and 23.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, annualized average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. Interest income on tax-exempt loans and securities has been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of 21 . All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

 Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 5.0 million, or 15.8 , to 37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The significant components of the increase were: Interest expense on deposits increased 4.9 million, or 19.7 , reflecting deposit growth and a 45 basis-point increase in rates paid. 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased 127,000 or 1.8 , reflecting an increase in the average balance partially offset by a 46 basis-point decrease in the cost of borrowings. 
 
 Compared to the first nine months of 2023, interest expense increased 27.7 million, or 33.7 , reflecting similar trends to the quarter-over-quarter results. Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income on a tax equivalent basis increased 1.0 million, or 3.2 , to 32.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing assets and liabilities increased 139.8 million and 170.2 million, respectively, and rate increases on interest-bearing liabilities outpaced the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets by 2 basis points. The net interest margin on a full tax equivalent basis increased 2 basis points to 2.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.34 for three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, net interest and dividend income on a tax equivalent basis decreased 3.1 million, or 3.2 , to 95.1 million from 98.2 million. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased by 21 basis points to 2.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income Tax Provision. The provision for income taxes was 366,000 and 5.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 million and 7.2 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.5 and 23.0 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.3 and 23.7 , respectively. The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects a discrete tax benefit as a result of the filing of amended tax returns to properly reflect tax exempt interest. Segments. The Company has two reportable segments: HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage. Revenue from HarborOne Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Revenue from HarborOne Mortgage is comprised of interest earned on loans and fees received as a result of the residential mortgage origination, sale and servicing process. Residential real estate portfolio loans are originated by HarborOne Mortgage and purchased by the Bank.

 HarborOne Bank Segment Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Income. The Bank s net income decreased 4.2 million, or 46.0 to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income reflects a 6.0 million increase in provision for credit losses and a 480,000 increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 312,000 increase in net interest and dividend income and a 154,000 increase in noninterest income. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, the Bank s net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5.8 million, or 22.9 to 19.6 million from 25.5 million. The decrease in net income reflects a decrease of 5.2 million, or 5.2 , in net interest and dividend income, an increase in noninterest expense of 3.3 million, or 4.2 , and a 1.3 million, or 26.1 , increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 1.5 million, or 7.9 increase in noninterest income. Provision for Credit Losses. The Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of 5.9 million and 6.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The provision for credit losses in 2024 primarily reflects the specific reserve allocation for a single credit in the amount of 4.7 million and provisioning for commercial loan growth, partially offset by improved qualitative factor adjustments for residential real estate mortgages as consumer metrics considered in the model improved. The Bank recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses of 113,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a provision for credit losses of 5.0 million reflecting a 5.7 million provision for loan credit losses, primarily for loan growth and charge off replenishment, partially offset by a 682,000 reversal of provision for unfunded commitments. Net charge-offs totaled 182,000, or 0.02 , of average loans outstanding on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net recoveries of 18,000 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net charge-offs were 502,000 and 2.6 million, respectively. Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income was 6.7 million and 20.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.5 million and 18.7 million for the respective prior year periods. The following table sets forth the components of noninterest income:

 o an increase in business account fees of 80,000 and 259,000, respectively; and o an increase in overdraft protection fees of 130,000 and 240,000, respectively. 
 BOLI income increase is due to updated crediting rates for 2024. 
 The Bank records an intersegment loss on loans purchased from HarborOne Mortgage that is offset in consolidation. The Bank purchased 86.8 million of residential mortgage loans from HarborOne Mortgage during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 132.4 million for the prior year period. 
 Swap fee income is collected and recorded at the time the swap contract is entered into, and therefore income fluctuates as a function of the swap agreements entered into in a period. 
 The gain on sale of assets held for sale is from the sale-leaseback of the building that currently houses HarborOne s Legion Parkway banking center in downtown Brockton. 
 The loss on sale of securities was realized on the sale of 17.5 million of available-for-sale securities with a weighted average book yield of 2.84

The year-over-year increase reflects higher incentive and ESOP expense. 
 The increase in deposit expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects: 
 
 o An increase in reciprocal deposit fees of 49,000 and 185,000, respectively; and o An increase in FHLB letter of credit fees of 80,000 and 212,000, respectively. The year-over-year increase in deposit insurance reflects a two-basis-point increase in the insurance rate and base increase.

 HarborOne Mortgage Segment Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Income. HarborOne Mortgage recorded a net loss of 1.1 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 138,000 and 1.1 million for the respective prior year periods. The HarborOne Mortgage segment s results are heavily impacted by prevailing interest rates, refinancing activity, and home sales. Noninterest Income. Total noninterest income was 3.8 million and 13.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.1 million and 14.2 million for the respective prior year periods. Noninterest income is primarily from mortgage banking income, for which the following table provides further detail: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Dollars Percent (dollars in thousands) Gain on sale of mortgage loans 3,752 2,704 1,048 38.8 Intersegment gain 277 249 28 11.2 Processing, underwriting and closing fees 555 453 102 22.5 Secondary market loan servicing fees net of guarantee fees 1,660 1,629 31 1.9 Changes in mortgage servicing rights fair value (2,421) 107 (2,528) (2,362.6) Other (4) 4 (100.0) Total noninterest income 3,823 5,138 (1,315) (25.6) Originated mortgage servicing rights included in gain on sale of mortgage loans 344 900 (556) (61.8) Change in 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity rate in basis points (55) 78

As interest rates rise and prepayment speeds decrease, MSR fair value tends to increase. 

 55 

Table of Contents HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. Management s Discussion and Analysis 
 Conversely, when interest rates fall and prepayment speeds increase, MSR fair value tends to decrease. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the MSR fair value declined 3.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively. These changes reflect the decrease of benchmark residential rates at September 30, 2024 and amortization related to principal payments, muted by MSR assumption caps used in the valuation model. MSR fair value change also includes an economic hedge to partially mitigate potential MSR valuation losses in a declining rate environment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, hedging gains were 845,000 and 344,000, respectively. Loan production and gain on sale of mortgages for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased versus the comparable prior year periods as mortgage demand picked up slightly on lower interest rates but continues to be hampered by low for-sale inventory.

The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects lower staffing levels for the period. 
 The decreases in the other noninterest expense categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect the cost saving actions taken throughout 2023 and continuing into 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, CRE and CRE construction loans rated substandard amounted to 54.9 million, and includes: A 17.2 million nonaccrual loan collateralized by a property included in the office sector with a specific reserve of 4.7 million. This is a participation loan originated by another institution within our market and is current as of September 30, 2024. A 13.7 million loan, modified during the second quarter of 2024, due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulty with a specific reserve of 128,000. This loan is collateralized by a property included in the office sector. The borrower was provided a rate reduction modification and is performing in accordance with the modified terms. Four additional credits totaling 24.0 million with specific reserves of 394,000. The loans are current and the sponsors continue to cooperate with the bank in addressing credit weakness. Loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was 15.3 million as of September 30, 2024, representing two credits, including the loan noted above, that were provided rate reduction and term extension modifications. As of September 30, 2024, the loans were performing in accordance with the modified terms and were current. Management continues to closely monitor the CRE loan portfolio for signs of deterioration given analysts projections of market softness over the near term due to higher vacancies and interest rates.

Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors consists of two basic components. The first component involves pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. A DCF methodology is used to estimate credit losses for each pooled portfolio segment. The methodology incorporates the probability of default and loss given default forecasted based on economic variable loss drivers. Management utilizes multiple economic projections and assumes these variables revert to the long-term average. Reversion towards long-term average generally begins eight quarters after the forecast start date and generally concludes within sixteen quarters of the forecast start date. The DCF methodology combines the probability of default, the loss given default, maturity date and prepayment speeds to estimate a reserve for each loan. The sum of all the loan level reserves is aggregated for each portfolio segment and a loss rate factor is derived. Quantitative loss factors for pooled loans are also supplemented by certain qualitative risk factors reflecting Management s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. The second component involves individually analyzed loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with loans that are pooled into portfolio segments. For loans that are individually analyzed, the ACL is measured using a DCF methodology based upon the loan s contractual effective interest rate, or at the loan s observable market price, or, if the loan is collateral-dependent, at the fair value of the collateral. In estimating the ACL on loans, Management considers the sensitivity of the model and significant judgments and assumptions that could result in an amount that is materially different from Management s estimate. Management performed a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of hypothetical changes in qualitative loss factors on the ACL. Due to the concentration of the Bank s ACL allocation in the total commercial portfolio, the sensitivity analysis evaluated the impact of changes to commercial loan segments. At September 30, 2024, the potential impact of changes to Management s judgements on total commercial qualitative risk factors ranged between a 17.2 million reduction and 26.2 million increase in the ACL. This sensitivity analysis does not represent a change to Management s judgment, but rather provides a hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of the ACL to a key input. The ACL was 54.0 million, or 1.11 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 48.0 million, or 1.01 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The ACL on individually analyzed loans amounted to 5.3 million, or 8.12 of the carrying value of individually analyzed loans. The ACL on unfunded commitments, included in other liabilities on the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets, amounted to 3.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 4.2 million at September 30, 2023.

Management of Market Risk The principal market risk facing the Company is interest-rate risk. The Company s Asset/Liability Committee establishes exposure limits that govern the Company s tolerance for interest-rate risk. The policy limits and guidelines serve as benchmarks for measuring interest-rate risk and for providing a framework for evaluation and interest-rate risk-management decision making. The Company s primary measure of its interest-rate risk is an income simulation model and an economic value of equity analysis. Net Interest Income Analysis. The Company uses income simulation as the primary tool for measuring interest-rate risk inherent in our balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over specified time frames, of instantaneous parallel shifts in market rates. For simulation purposes, the Company s balance sheet is assumed to remain static over the simulation horizon. The model results are dependent on material assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, Management s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates (deposit betas). These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet composition and market conditions. Assumptions are supported with quarterly back-testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.

 The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net interest income simulation results that estimate the impact of interest rate changes on the Company s estimated net interest income over two years: 

Change in Net Interest Income change from year one base) Changes in Interest Rates September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (basis points) (1) Year One Year Two Year One Year Two +300 (11.2) (13.3) (13.1) (11.8) +200 (7.6) (8.8) (8.6) (7.7) +100 (4.0) (4.4) (4.2) (3.5) -100 2.0 2.5 4.6 4.7 -200 2.5 1.9 6.4 4.5 -300 2.8 0.3 N/A N/A -400 2.4 (2.7) N/A N/A (1) The calculated change in net interest income assumes an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve. Economic Value of Equity Analysis. The Company also uses the net present value of EVE methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve up 100, 200, and 300 basis points and down 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024 the estimated changes in the EVE that would result from an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. 

At September 30, 2024 EVE as a Percentage of Economic Estimated Increase (Decrease) Value of Assets Changes in Interest Rates Estimated in EVE Changes in (basis points) (1) EVE Amount Percent EVE Ratio (2) Percent (dollars in thousands) + 300 415,652 (161,772) (28.0) 8.2 (2.3) + 200 479,473 (97,951) (17.0) 9.2 (1.3) + 100 538,420 (39,004) (6.8) 10.1 (0.4) 0 577,424 10.5 - 100 594,552 17,128 3.0 10.5 - 200 553,509 (23,915) (4.1) 9.6 (0.9) - 300 501,855 (75,569) (13.1) 8.5 (2.0) -400 424,349 (153,075) (26.5) 7.1 (3.4) (1) Assumes instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates. (2) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the economic value of assets. The board of directors and Management review the methodology s measurements for both net interest income and EVE on a quarterly basis to determine whether the exposure resulting from the changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels and develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure.

 Liquidity Management and Capital Resources Liquidity measures the Company s ability to meet both current and future financial obligations of a short- and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and amortization of securities, and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions. Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (iv) the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies. We continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position. We have access to immediate liquid resources in cash and cash equivalents of 224.3 million at September 30, 2024, which are primarily on deposit with the FRBB. Maturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans and securities to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRBB. As of September 30, 2024, we had additional borrowing capacity of 830.3 million from the FHLB and 419.2 million from the FRBB based on the amount of collateral pledged. We also have additional borrowing capacity under a 25.0 million unsecured federal funds line with a correspondent bank. Potential sources of liquidity also include unpledged investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio with a carrying value of 3.4 million and our ability to sell loans in the secondary market. Our core deposits (which we define as deposits other than certificates of deposits) have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. However, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions and fluctuations in our business customers own liquidity needs and may be negatively impacted by unexpected deposit withdrawals from weakness in the financial markets and industry-wide reductions in liquidity. The Company utilizes third- party brokers to obtain brokered deposits to supplement core deposit fluctuations and loan growth. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 373.7 million in brokered deposits. Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity. In the ordinary course of the Company s operations, the Company has entered into certain contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 102.9 million and unadvanced funds on loans of 756.8 million. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature within one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 1.23 billion. The Company believes that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels and liquidity. Other than normal changes in the ordinary course of business, there have been no significant changes in the types of contractual obligations or amounts due since December 31, 2023. Our ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity is dependent on our ability to continue to maintain a strong risk profile and capital base. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and were considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this Form 10-Q contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of the tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-assets ratio, is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. The following table reconciles the Company s tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-assets ratio for the periods indicated: 

September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars on thousands) Tangible common equity: Total stockholders' equity 584,202 584,634 Less: Goodwill 59,042 69,802 Less: Other intangible assets (1) 947 1,704 Tangible common equity 524,213 513,128 Tangible assets: Total assets 5,775,967 5,664,387 Less: Goodwill 59,042 69,802 Less: Other intangible assets (1) 947 1,704 Tangible assets 5,715,978 5,592,881 Tangible common equity / tangible assets (2) 9.17 9.17 (1) Other intangible assets are core deposit intangibles. (2) This non-GAAP ratio is total stockholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets to total assets less goodwill and intangible assets.
