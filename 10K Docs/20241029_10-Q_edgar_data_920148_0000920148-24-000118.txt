 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, cash flows, and financial position have been made. Except as otherwise disclosed, all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and do not contain certain information included in the Company s fiscal year 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report). Therefore, these interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report. 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries for which it exercises control. Long-term investments in affiliated companies in which the Company exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which the Company does not exercise significant influence (generally, when the Company has an investment of less than and no representation on the investee's board of directors) are accounted for at fair value, or at cost minus impairment adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer for those investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company does not have any significant variable interest entities or special purpose entities whose financial results are not included in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The financial statements of the Company's operating foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the period.

The costs to provide these services are included in operating income but the service fees are included in other income.

 Dilutive effect of employee stock options and awards Net earnings including impact of dilutive adjustments 
 Diluted earnings per share represent the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. These potential shares include dilutive stock options and unissued restricted stock awards. 

Goodwill acquired during the period Foreign currency impact and other adjustments to goodwill ) ) ) Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 
 Although the Company believes that the current assumptions and estimates used in its goodwill analysis are reasonable, supportable, and appropriate, the Company's business could be impacted by unfavorable changes, including those that impact the existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact existing assumptions: primarily, a worsening economic environment and protracted economic downturn and related impacts, including delays in revenue from new customers; increases in customer termination activity; or increases in operating costs. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance. 
 The Company will continue to monitor the financial performance of, and assumptions for, its reporting units. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the revenue and terminal growth rates, decreased operating margin, or substantial reductions in end markets and volume assumptions, could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting units. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

 The Company (and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates) is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation (including those described in more detail below), arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these actions involve claims that are substantial in amount. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property disputes, commercial and contract disputes, professional liability claims, employee-related matters, transaction-related disputes, securities and corporate law matters, and inquiries, including subpoenas and other civil investigative demands, from governmental agencies, Medicare or Medicaid payers and managed care organizations (MCOs) reviewing billing practices or requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. The Company receives civil investigative demands or other inquiries from various governmental bodies in the ordinary course of its business. Such inquiries can relate to the Company or other parties, including physicians and other health care providers. The Company works cooperatively to respond to appropriate requests for information. 
 The Company also is named from time to time in suits brought under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and comparable state laws. These suits typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or certifications in connection with claims for payment from U.S. federal or state healthcare programs. The suits may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Such claims are an inevitable part of doing business in the healthcare field today. 
 The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its commercial laboratory operations and biopharma laboratory services. These industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the courts have not interpreted many of the applicable statutes and regulations. Therefore, the applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, additional liabilities from third-party claims, and/or exclusion from participation in government programs. 
 Many of the current claims and legal actions against the Company are in preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. The Company records an aggregate legal reserve, which is determined using calculations based on historical loss rates and assessment of trends experienced in settlements and defense costs. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450 Contingencies, the Company establishes reserves for judicial, regulatory, and arbitration matters outside the aggregate legal reserve if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both

 (dollars and shares in millions, except per share data) 

 probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish separate reserves. 
 The Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably probable loss for the proceedings described in more detail below in which damages either have not been specified or, in the Company's judgment, are unsupported and/or exaggerated and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (iv) there are novel legal issues to be presented. For these proceedings, however, the Company does not believe, based on currently available information, that the adverse outcomes are probable and reasonably estimable, and it does not believe they will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. 
 The Company has received various subpoenas and other civil investigative demands related to Medicaid billing. In October 2013, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the State of Texas Office of the Attorney General requesting documents related to its billing to Texas Medicaid.

On April 14, 2021, the Petition was unsealed. The Petition alleges that the Company submitted claims for reimbursement to Texas Medicaid that were higher than permitted under Texas Medicaid s alleged best price regulations, and that the Company offered remuneration to Texas health care providers in the form of discounted pricing for certain laboratory testing services in exchange for the providers referral of Texas Medicaid business to the Company. The Petition seeks actual and double damages and civil penalties, as well as recovery of costs, attorney's fees, and legal expenses. On August 1, 2022, the District Court entered an order granting the Company's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with respect to the claim that the Company submitted claims for reimbursement to Texas Medicaid that were higher than permitted under Texas Medicaid's alleged best price regulations. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Non-Suit and Motion for Entry of Final Judgment and, on November 11, 2022, the court entered a Judgment. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with respect to the court's order granting the Company's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, referenced above. The Company will vigorously defend the lawsuit.

Laboratory Corporation of America, et al. , filed in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit for Hillsborough County, Florida. The complaint alleges that the Company violated the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act by billing patients who were collecting benefits under the Workers' Compensation Statutes. The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief and actual and statutory damages, as well as recovery of attorney's fees and legal expenses. In April 2017, the Circuit Court granted the Company s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Plaintiff appealed the Circuit Court s ruling to the Florida Second District Court of Appeal. On October 16, 2019, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal reversed the Circuit Court s dismissal, but certified a controlling issue of Florida law to the Florida Supreme Court. On February 17, 2020, the Florida Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction of the lawsuit. The court held oral arguments on December 9, 2020.

 AMCA only when direct collection efforts were unsuccessful. The Company s systems were not impacted by the AMCA Incident. Upon learning of the AMCA Incident, the Company promptly stopped sending new collection requests to AMCA and stopped AMCA from continuing to work on any pending collection requests from the Company. AMCA informed the Company that it appeared that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA s system between August 1, 2018, and March 30, 2019, and that AMCA could not rule out the possibility that personal information on AMCA s system was at risk during that time period. Information on AMCA s affected system from the Company may have included name, address, and balance information for the patient and person responsible for payment, along with the patient s phone number, date of birth, referring physician, and date of service. The Company was later informed by AMCA that health insurance information may have been included for some individuals, and because some insurance carriers utilize the Social Security Number as a subscriber identification number, the Social Security Number for some individuals may also have been affected. No ordered tests, laboratory test results, or diagnostic information from the Company were in the AMCA affected system. The Company notified individuals for whom it had a valid mailing address. For the individuals whose Social Security Number was affected, the notice included an offer to enroll in credit monitoring and identity protection services that was provided free of charge for 24 months. 
 Twenty-three putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company related to the AMCA Incident in various U.S. District Courts. Numerous similar lawsuits have been filed against other health care providers who used AMCA. These lawsuits were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation in the District of New Jersey. On November 15, 2019, the Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey. The consolidated Complaint generally alleged that the Company did not adequately protect its patients data and failed to timely notify those patients of the AMCA Incident.

The Complaint sought damages on behalf of a class of all affected Company customers. On January 22, 2020, the Company filed Motions to Dismiss all claims.

The complaint generally alleges that the defendants failed to ensure that the Company utilized proper cybersecurity safeguards and failed to implement a sufficient response to data security incidents, including the AMCA Incident. The complaint asserts derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks relief including damages, certain disclosures, and certain changes to the Company s internal governance practices. On June 2, 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Stay the lawsuit due to its overlap with the multi-district litigation referenced above. On July 2, 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss.

 The Company has a noncontrolling interest put related to its Ontario subsidiary that has been classified as mezzanine equity in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest put is valued at its contractually determined value, which approximates fair value. 
 The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in an employee-funded deferred compensation plan (DCP). A participant's deferrals are allocated by the participant to one or more of multiple measurement funds, which are indexed to externally managed funds. From time to time, to offset the cost of the growth in the participant's investment accounts, the Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies. Changes in the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments, which are typically invested in a similar manner to the participant's allocations. Changes in the fair value of the DCP obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units. The cash surrender value and the DCP obligations are classified within Level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments. 
 Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities are measured at fair value using Level 3 valuations. These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are remeasured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. The increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration payable can result from changes in anticipated revenue levels and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3. 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair market value of the senior notes, based on market pricing, was approximately and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's note and debt instruments are classified as Level 2 instruments, as the fair market values of these instruments are determined using other observable inputs.

 Separation of Fortrea Holdings Inc. 
 On June 30, 2023, Labcorp completed the previously announced separation of Fortrea from the Company. 
 All historical operating results of Fortrea are presented as Discontinued Operations, net of tax, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of operations. The spin-off is expected to be treated as tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 As a result of the separation of Fortrea, the Company recast segment results to exclude the historical results of the CDCS business for all periods presented. The remaining operations of the previously reported Drug Development segment have been renamed the Biopharma Laboratory Services segment. 
 GENERAL (dollars in millions, except per share data) 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 9,679.5, an increase of 6.0 from 9,128.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to organic revenue of 3.4 , acquisitions, net of divestitures, of 2.4 , and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.2 . The 3.4 increase in organic revenue was driven by a 4.5 increase in the Company's organic Base Business, partially offset by a 1.1 decrease in COVID-19 PCR testing (COVID-19 Testing). Base Business includes Labcorp's operations except for COVID-19 Testing. 
 The Company defines organic growth as the increase in revenue excluding the year-over-year impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency. Acquisition and divestiture impact is considered for a twelve month period following the close of each transaction.

Equity Method Income 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Equity method income (expense), net (0.5) (0.3) 66.3 
 Equity method income (expense) represents the Company's ownership share in joint venture partnerships along with equity investments in other companies in the health care industry. The decrease in income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the corresponding period in 2023, was partially due to the sale of the Company's interest in one joint venture and the acquisition of the remaining interest in another joint venture during 2023.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Other, net 4.3 21.1 78.5 
 The change in Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is partially due to a decrease of 4.3 of transition services fees charged to Fortrea related to administrative and IT systems support. The costs to provide these services are included in operating income but the service fees are included in other income. In addition, the Company recorded investment losses of 1.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to investment gains of 4.0 for the corresponding period of 2023.

 During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company modified the segment performance measure to exclude the amortization of intangibles and other assets, restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other asset impairments, and certain corporate charges for items such as transaction costs, remaining unallocated costs of the CDCS business, COVID-19-related costs, and other special items. These changes align with how the CODM now evaluates segment performance and allocates resources. Prior periods have been conformed for comparability. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Dx segment operating income 1,246.8 1,237.5 0.7 Dx segment operating margin 16.5 17.5 (1.0) BLS segment operating income 328.2 287.2 14.2 BLS segment operating margin 15.2 13.8 1.4 Segment operating income 1,575.0 1,524.7 3.3 General corporate and unallocated expenses (481.7) (469.7) 2.6 Amortization of intangibles and other assets (186.0) (160.6) 15.8 Goodwill and other asset impairments (2.5) (15.2) (83.8) Restructuring and other charges (34.6) (30.8) 12.3 Total operating income 870.2 848.4 2.6 
 Dx operating income was 1,246.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.3 over operating income of 1,237.5 in the corresponding period of 2023, and Dx operating margin decreased 100 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in operating margin was due to a reduction in COVID-19 Testing, higher personnel costs, and the impact from the Invitae transaction, partially offset by growth in the Base Business. 
 BLS operating income was 328.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 41.0 over operating income of 287.2 in the corresponding period of 2023, and BLS operating margin increased 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase was due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense. 
 General corporate expenses are comprised primarily of administrative services such as executive management, human resources, legal, finance, corporate affairs, and information technology. Corporate expenses were 481.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.0 over corporate expenses of 469.7 in the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, and personnel costs. 
 The Company remains on track to deliver approximately 100.0 to 125.0 of Launchpad savings in fiscal 2024. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars and shares in millions) 
 The Company's cash-generating ability and financial condition typically have provided ready access to capital markets. The Company's principal source of liquidity is operating cash flow, supplemented by proceeds from debt offerings. The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, cash dividends, and share repurchases over the next twelve months and beyond. The Company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility is further discussed in Note 7 (Debt) to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

31 

INDEX 

In summary, the Company's cash flows from continuing operations were as follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 808.6 622.7 Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations (1,157.2) (816.2) Net cash provide by (used for) financing activities from continuing operations 1,326.6 (1,112.5) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2.5 3.5 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations 980.5 (1,302.5) 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, and 2023, totaled 1,517.3 and 727.9, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as time deposits, commercial paper, and other money market investments, which have original maturities of three months or less. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's continuing operations used 808.6 of cash as compared to providing 622.7 during the same period in 2023. The 185.9 increase in cash provided from operations in 2024 as compared with the corresponding 2023 period is primarily due to higher cash earnings. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,157.2 as compared to 816.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to an increase in business acquisitions and higher capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Capital expenditures were 377.8 and 286.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 On September 17, 2024, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Cinven, Inc. to acquire a 15 minority interest in SYNLAB, a leader in medical diagnostic services and specialty testing in Europe, for approximately 155.9 140.0). The transaction is anticipated to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type, including applicable regulatory approvals. The Company will acquire the minority interest through an intermediate holding company that will be established to hold the investment with SYNLAB and will be represented on the holding company board with Cinven, Inc. and other investors. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,326.6 as compared to net cash used for financing activities of 1,112.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to 2,000.0 of proceeds for new debt securities, and 300.0 of proceeds for the AR Facility, offset by the 600.0 payment of the 3.25 senior notes due September 2024. 
 On September 23, 2024, LCAH entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) (the Indenture). Also, on September 23, 2024, the Company, LCAH, and the Trustee entered into certain first, second, and third supplemental indentures to the Indenture under each of which LCAH issued, and the Company guaranteed, 650.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.35 Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes), 500.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.55 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes) and 850.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.80 Senior Notes due 2034, respectively (the 2034 Notes and, together with the 2030 Notes and the 2032 Notes, the Notes), totaling 2,000.0. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing April 1, 2025. Net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately 1,982.1 after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. The net proceeds were used to redeem or repay indebtedness and, to the extent not used for such purpose, for other general corporate purposes. Indebtedness redeemed or repaid at or prior to maturity were the Company's 2.30 senior notes due 2024, its 3.60 senior notes due 2025 and 350.0 of borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
 On August 23, 2024, the Company and a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle entered into an AR Facility with PNC Bank, National Association with a three-year term. The AR Facility provides for purchases of accounts receivable by PNC in an amount of up to 300.0 through August of 2027 and may increase to up to 700.0, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received loan proceeds of 300.0 under the AR Facility, which is included in cash from financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

INDEX 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had 1,517.3 of cash and 1,000.0 of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2026. Under the Company's credit facilities and indentures relating to the Company's senior notes, the Company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers , and with respect to the credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain leverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facilities and the indentures related to the Company's outstanding senior notes at September 30, 2024. The Company expects that it will remain in compliance with all covenants associated with its existing debt obligations for the next twelve months. 
 On July 24, 2024, the Board adopted a new share repurchase plan authorizing up to 1,000.0 of the Company's shares in addition to the remaining amount outstanding under the previous plan. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding authorization from the board of directors to purchase up to 1,355.4 of the Company's common stock. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid 183.0 in common stock dividends. On October 10, 2024, the Company announced a cash dividend of 0.72 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter, or approximately 61.0 in the aggregate. The dividend will be payable on December 13, 2024, to stockholders of record of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business on November 26, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company s board of directors. 
 Guarantor Information 
 In connection with the Reorganization, the Company, LCAH and the Trustee entered into a seventeenth supplemental indenture (the Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture) to an indenture, dated as of November 19, 2010, between LCAH and the Trustee (the 2010 Indenture). In addition, the Company, LCAH and the Trustee entered into the 2024 Indenture (the 2010 Indenture, together with the 2024 Indenture, the Indentures). The Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture, among other things, provides for the full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of LCAH s obligations under the 2010 Indenture, and each series of senior unsecured notes issued and outstanding thereunder, and the 2024 Indenture provides for the full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of LCAH s obligations, and each series of senior unsecured notes issued and outstanding, thereunder (collectively, the Labcorp Holdings Guarantees). Also, the Indentures permit the Company to satisfy LCAH s reporting obligations so long as the Labcorp Holdings Guarantees remain in place and the Company s financial statements and other information comply with the requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and the Exchange Act (Regulation S-X). 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 4,492.9 and 2,000.0 aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding senior notes of LCAH, issued under the 2010 Indenture and the 2024 Indenture, respectively, that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, separate consolidated financial statements of LCAH have not been presented. As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for LCAH because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of LCAH are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in the Company s consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors. 
 Credit Ratings 
 The Company s investment grade debt ratings from Moody s and from Standard and Poor s (S P) contribute to its ability to access capital markets. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (dollars in millions) 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other relevant market rate or price changes. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the Company regularly evaluates its exposure to such changes. The Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, and interest rate and cross currency swap agreements. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 Approximately 13.6 of the Company s revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 13.7 of the Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (USD). The Company s financial statements are reported in USD and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into USD for purposes of reporting the Company s consolidated financial results. In the third quarter of 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the Canadian dollar, Swiss Franc, Euro and British Pound. Excluding the 
 33 

INDEX 

impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10 in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to USD would have impacted income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 20.8. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity were and ) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. 
 The Company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of time, ranging from months to years. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the Company s profitability with respect to such contracts. The Company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. The Company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 9 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through October 2024 with a notional value totaling approximately 382.0. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 9 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through January 2024 with a notional value totaling approximately 305.8. 
 The Company is party to USD to Swiss Franc cross-currency swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 1,200.0, 300.0 maturing in 2029, maturing in 2031 and 600.0 maturing in 2034, as a hedge against the impact of foreign exchange movements on its net investment in a Swiss Franc functional currency subsidiary. 
 Interest Rates 
 Some of the Company s debt from time to time is subject to interest at variable rates. As a result, fluctuations in interest rates can affect the business. The Company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including by the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. 
 Borrowings under the Company s term loan credit facility, now repaid, and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. 
 In May 2021, to hedge against changes in the fair value portion of the Company s long-term debt, the Company entered into fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for the 2.70 senior notes due 2031 with an aggregate notional value of 500.0 and variable interest rates based on three-month SOFR plus 1.0706 . 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART I - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, above, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risk factors set forth below revise and supplement the corresponding risk factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. With the exception of the following, there have been no material changes in the risk factors that appear in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of diagnostic products, increased FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), and regulation by other countries of diagnostic tests and related products could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business. 
 The FDA has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution, and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. Dx s point-of-care testing devices are subject to regulation by the FDA. 
 LDTs developed by high complexity clinical laboratories are currently generally offered as services to health care providers under the CLIA regulatory framework administered by CMS, without the requirement for FDA clearance or approval. However, since the 1990s, the FDA has asserted that it has authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices but has exercised enforcement discretion to refrain from systematic regulation of LDTs. In 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance describing how it intended to discontinue its enforcement discretion policy and begin regulating LDTs as medical devices; however, that draft guidance was not finalized, and the FDA instead continued its enforcement discretion policy and indicated that it intended to work with Congress to enact comprehensive legislative reform of diagnostics oversight. In February 2020, the FDA issued a statement with a table of pharmacogenetic associations setting forth certain gene-drug interactions that the agency determined are supported by the scientific literature to help ensure that claims being made for pharmacogenetic tests are grounded in sound science, thereby reducing the risk of enforcement actions with respect to LDTs offering claims consistent with the table. The FDA noted that it could take enforcement actions under the current medical device framework regarding diagnostic claims the agency determines not to be sufficiently supported. In addition, in 2021, the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge, IVCT Development (VALID) Act was introduced in Congress and provided a framework to regulate in vitro diagnostics and LDTs as in vitro clinical tests. In 2022, the VALID Act was incorporated into the Senate user fee bill but was not included in the year-end Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. On March 29, 2023, the VALID Act was reintroduced and remains pending. On April 29, 2024, the FDA released a final rule purporting to clarify its authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, under which it will phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs under a four-year period subject to certain continuing enforcement discretion policies. More specifically, among other policies, the final rule provides that the FDA will continue to exercise discretion not to enforce premarket review and most FDA quality system requirements for unmodified LDTs first marketed prior to issuance of the final rule; will continue to exercise discretion not to enforce premarket review requirements for LDTs approved by the State of New York; and will continue to exercise discretion not to enforce premarket review and most FDA quality system requirements for LDTs developed and performed by a laboratory integrated into a health system for unmet needs for patients under the care of the same health system, where no FDA cleared or approved test is available. The final rule was published on May 6, 2024, and in the absence of a successful legal challenge, will become effective on May 6, 2025. On May 29, 2024, the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) and its member company, HealthTrackRx, filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, challenging the FDA's final rule. While the lawsuit may change the final rule or delay or prevent its enforcement, the issuance of the final rule presents an increased risk of FDA enforcement actions for laboratory tests offered by companies without FDA clearance or approval that do not fall within the ongoing enforcement discretion policies. However, the outcome and its ultimate impact on the Company s business remain difficult to predict at this time. 
 Current FDA regulation of the Company s diagnostic products and the potential for future increased regulation of the Company s LDTs could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions, and other civil and criminal sanctions, and could impair the development and commercialization of new tests, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company.

INDEX 

Regulation of diagnostics products in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates may impact laboratory testing offered by the Company in both Dx and BLS. For example, the European Union In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (EU IVDR)) established a new legislative framework for in vitro diagnostic devices that are used in certain circumstances, and includes a rule-based classification and quality and safety standards. The EU IVDR, where applicable to BLS's services, could impact BLS's ability to support trials, result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions, and have an adverse effect.
