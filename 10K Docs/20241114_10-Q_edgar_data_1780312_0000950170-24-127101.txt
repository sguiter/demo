Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of any recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, the Company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share. The Company is authorized to issue shares of Class A Common Stock with a par value of per share. Class B Common Stock As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class B Common Stock were issued to then existing equity holders of AST LLC (other than Abel Avellan, the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Avellan )) at the time of Business Combination and are noneconomic, but entitle the holder to one vote per share. The Company is authorized to issue shares of Class B Common Stock with a par value of per share. The existing equity holders of AST LLC (other than Mr. Avellan) at the time of Business Combination own economic interests in AST LLC which are redeemable into either shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at the option of the Redemption Election Committee. Upon redemption of the AST LLC Common Units by the existing equity holders (other than Mr. Avellan), a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by such existing equity holders will be cancelled. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the existing equity holders redeemed AST LLC Common Units into Class A Common Stock and subsequently Class B Common Stock held by such existing equity holders were cancelled.

shares of Class C Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class C Common Stock were issued to Mr. Avellan in connection with the Business Combination and are non-economic, but entitle the holder to the lesser of 10 votes per share and the Class C Share Voting Amount, the latter of which is a number of votes per share equal to (1) (x) an amount of votes equal to of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock, minus (y) the total voting power of the outstanding capital stock (other than Class C Common Stock) owned or controlled by Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees, divided by (2) the number of shares of Class C Common Stock then outstanding (the Super-Voting Rights ). The Company is authorized to issue shares of Class C Common Stock with a par value of per share. Mr. Avellan owns economic interests in AST LLC which are redeemable into either shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at the option of the Redemption Election Committee. Upon redemption of the AST LLC Common Units by Mr. Avellan, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock held by Mr. Avellan will be cancelled. Correspondingly, the Super-Voting Rights associated with the shares of Class C Common Stock cancelled will be terminated. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mr. Avellan did not redeem any AST LLC Common Units. Preferred Stock At September 30, 2024 there were shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. The Company is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors. Noncontrolling Interest The noncontrolling interests represent the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than the Company. Changes in the Company s ownership interest in AST LLC while retaining control of AST LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. Income or loss is attributed to the noncontrolling interests based on their contractual distribution rights, and the relative percentages of equity interest held by the Company and the other members during the period. As the sole managing member of AST LLC controlling the operating decisions of AST LLC, the Company consolidates the financial position and results of operations of AST LLC and its subsidiaries. The Company reports equity interests in AST LLC held by members other than the Company as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest is classified as permanent equity within the consolidated balance sheets as the Company may only elect to settle a redemption request in cash if the cash delivered in the exchange is limited to the amount of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of a Class A Common Stock from a new permanent equity offering. Each issuance of the Company's Class A Common Stock is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST LLC Common Units to the Company, which results in changes in ownership and reduction in noncontrolling interest. As of September 30, 2024, there were Private Placement Warrants outstanding (see Note 6: Warrant Liabilities for further details), each of which entitles the holder to purchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of per share. Each warrant exercise is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST LLC Common Units to the Company, which results in a change in ownership and reduces the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increases additional paid-in capital. In addition, the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of AST LLC A R Operating Agreement permits the noncontrolling interest holders of AST LLC Common Units to exchange AST LLC Common Units, together with related shares of the Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, for shares of the Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or, at the election of the Company, for cash (a Cash Exchange ). A Cash Exchange is limited to the amount of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Class A Common Stock. Future redemptions or direct exchanges of AST LLC Common Units by the noncontrolling interest holders will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase additional paid-in capital. Certain members of AST LLC also hold incentive stock options that are subject to service or performance conditions (see Note 9: Stock-Based Compensation for further details), that are exercisable for AST LLC Common Units which will simultaneously be redeemed for Class A Common Stock. The exercise of the options results in a change in ownership and decreases the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increases additional paid-in capital. The Company previously granted service-based and performance-based restricted stock units and service-based options that are exercisable for Class A Common Stock under the 2020 Incentive Award Plan. The Company now grants service-based and performance-based restricted stock units under the 2024 Incentive Award Plan (see Note 9: Stock-Based Compensation for further details). The vesting of the restricted stock units and the exercise of the options result in a change in ownership and decrease the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase additional paid-in capital.

The Company estimates the fair value of the stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of the Company's stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) any expected dividends. Due to the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company based the estimate of expected volatility on the estimated and expected volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, the Company selects companies with comparable characteristics including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of the Company s stock price becomes available. For awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options, the Company estimates the expected life of the employee stock options using the simplified method, whereby the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of the Board of Directors is based on the fair value of the Company s stock on the grant date. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense. AST LLC 2019 Equity Incentive Plan Prior to the Business Combination, under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan AST LLC Incentive Plan ), AST LLC was authorized to issue ordinary shares, as well as options exercisable for ordinary shares, as incentives to its employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of its Board of Directors.

In connection with the Business Combination, the existing AST LLC options were reclassified into options to acquire AST LLC Incentive Equity Units, and there was no incremental compensation cost and the terms of the outstanding awards, including fair value, vesting conditions and classification, were unchanged. Each AST LLC Incentive Equity Unit is convertible into one AST LLC Common Unit and each AST LLC Common Unit is redeemable for one share of Class A Common Stock on the later of the (i) 24-month anniversary of the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) six-month anniversary from the vesting date. The AST LLC Incentive Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under it, except that in

 and , respectively, and the consolidated effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and respectively. The difference between the federal statutory tax rate of and the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the Company s Up-C organizational structure and allocation of AST LLC results to noncontrolling interest holders and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company s net deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a net deferred tax asset for the difference between the book value and tax basis of the Company s investment in AST LLC at the time of the Business Combination. The Company has assessed the realizability of their deferred tax assets and in that analysis has considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset resulting from the Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024, there is no valuation allowance recorded against the foreign deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the foreign deferred tax assets will be fully realized. The foreign deferred tax assets are subject to foreign exchange risk, which could reduce the amount the Company may ultimately realize. The Company had uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In conjunction with the Business Combination, the Company also entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement TRA with AST LLC. Pursuant to the TRA, the Company is required to pay TRA holders (as defined in the TRA) (i) of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (A) existing tax basis of certain assets of AST LLC and its subsidiaries attributable to the AST LLC Common Units, (B) tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of AST LLC Common Units acquired by the Company, (C) tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA, and (D) certain tax attributes that are acquired directly or indirectly by the Company pursuant to a reorganization transaction. All such payments to the TRA holders (as defined in the TRA) are the obligations of the Company, and not those of AST LLC. As of September 30, 2024 , there have been no TRA liabilities recorded.

 Overview 
 
 We are building the first and only global Cellular Broadband network in space to be accessible directly by everyday smartphones (2G/4G-LTE/5G devices) for commercial use, and other applications for government use utilizing our extensive intellectual property IP and patent portfolio. Our SpaceMobile Service is being designed to provide cost-effective, high-speed Cellular Broadband services to end-users who are out of terrestrial cellular coverage using existing mobile devices. The SpaceMobile Service currently is planned to be provided by a constellation of high-powered, large phased-array satellites in Low Earth Orbit LEO using low band and middle band spectrum controlled by Mobile Network Operators MNOs ). We are headquartered in Texas where we operate 185,000 square feet satellite assembly, integrating and testing AIT facilities. Our IP portfolio is diverse, containing numerous and various innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. Our IP portfolio consists of 36 patent families worldwide. As of September 30, 2024, we had more than 3,450 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which approximately 1,390 have been officially granted or allowed. 
 
 We intend to work with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to the MNOs end-user customers. Our vision is that users will not need to subscribe to the SpaceMobile Service directly through us, nor will they need to purchase any new or additional equipment. Instead, users will be able to access the SpaceMobile Service when prompted on their mobile device that they are no longer within range of the land-based facilities of the MNO operator or will be able to purchase a plan directly with their existing mobile provider. We intend to seek to use a revenue-sharing business model for SpaceMobile Service in our agreements with MNOs. 
 
 The SpaceMobile Service is expected to be highly attractive to MNOs as it will enable them to improve and differentiate their service offering without significant incremental capital investments. The SpaceMobile Service is expected to enable MNOs to augment and extend their coverage without building towers or other land-based infrastructure, including where it is not cost-justified or is difficult due to geographical challenges. As a result of the incremental coverage created by the planned SpaceMobile Service, we believe that MNOs will have the opportunity to increase subscribers average revenue per user ARPU ). 
 
 On April 1, 2019, we launched our first test satellite, BW1, which was used to validate our satellite to cellular architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol. 
 
 24 

We launched our BlueWalker 3 BW3 test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the communication phased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. During 2023, using the BW3 test satellite, we successfully completed two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones, achieved repeated successful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second Mbps to standard unmodified smartphones and successful two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using 5G connectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5 megahertz MHz of low band spectrum. Since then, we have achieved successful download speeds above 21 Mbps, spectral efficiency of approximately 3 bits per hertz, and have also successfully completed initial in-orbit and ground testing for non-communication government applications. We intend to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test satellite, including further testing with cellular service providers and the government. 
 
 We launched five first generation commercial BB satellites Block 1 BB satellites on September 12, 2024. In October 2024, we completed the deployment of the communication phased array antennas and Q/V antennas in orbit and performed a series of monitoring tests and activities to confirm the successful initial operations of the Block 1 BB satellites. Accordingly, we determined that the five Block 1 BB satellites were ready for their intended use as of October 29, 2024. The total cost incurred for the assembly, integration, testing, launch and deployment of the five Block 1 BB satellites includes direct materials, launch costs, direct labor and overheads including launch insurance attributable to bringing the five Block 1 BB satellites to a working condition and desired location for the intended use. As of September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 119.0 million, an increase of 3.3 over the previous estimate of 115.0 million, in direct materials and launch costs in connection with the five Block 1 BB satellites. 
 
 The SpaceMobile Service has not been launched and therefore has not yet generated any revenue. We currently plan to utilize the five Block 1 BB satellites to initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in targeted geographical areas, including in the United States, and validate and test non-commercial government applications and seek to generate revenue from such services. Prior to initiating SpaceMobile Service in each jurisdiction, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we would provide such service and would need to enter into commercial agreements with MNOs relating to the offering of such service in each jurisdiction. We have received an initial license from the United States Federal Communications Commission FCC to launch and operate the first five Block 1 BB satellites using S- and UHF-band frequencies to support telemetry, tracking, and control operations. We have entered into a space-based wireless connectivity agreement with AT T Services, Inc. AT T Services to provide SpaceMobile Service to AT T Services end users for use within the continental United States (excluding Alaska) and Hawaii. We also plan to enter into similar commercial agreements with Verizon in the United States. Before we begin providing full commercial SpaceMobile Service in the United States, we will need to obtain additional approvals from the FCC. We are expanding our efforts on ground infrastructure development for commercial readiness and integrating our SpaceMobile Service into the MNOs infrastructure to initiate commercial services. 
 
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we have recognized revenue from completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. Government and expect to continue to recognize revenue throughout 2024 as and when we complete the remaining performance obligations under the agreement. In 2024, we also expect to begin generating revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to MNOs and other third parties. We believe initiation of limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service, as well as completing the milestones under the agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. Government, will help to demonstrate the advantages of our satellite-based Cellular Broadband service in the market. These market activities will commence while we continue the development and testing of the next generation of commercial BB satellites. 
 
 Our next generation of commercial BB satellites Block 2 BB satellites are expected to derive greater performance through the introduction of our own AST5000 Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC chip, which we believe will enable materially greater throughput capacity of up to 40 MHz per beam to support 120 Mbps peak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require less power and offer a lower overall unit cost. As of the date of this report, we have completed the design and tape-out of our ASIC chip. Until the qualification and assembly of our ASIC chip is complete, we expect to continue to manufacture and launch Block 2 BB satellites that are based on a FPGA Field Programmable Gate Arrays chip. The Block 2 BB satellites, featuring up to approximately 2,400 square feet communications array, the largest communication array ever deployed in a LEO for commercial use and more than 3 times bigger than the communications array of the Block 1 BB satellites, are designed to deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity of the Block 1 BB satellites in orbit today. We believe the larger aperture array is expected to provide greater spectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity, thereby reducing the necessary number of satellites to achieve service coverage as compared to smaller apertures. 
 
 We continue to make progress towards the completion of the design and development of our Block 2 BB satellites. We are leveraging the technological expertise and manufacturing know-how derived from the assembly and testing of our Block 1 BB satellite in the development and assembly of our Block 2 BB satellites. We are vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems to reduce our dependency on suppliers, ensure timely supply of satellite components and subsystems to meet our launch timeline, and lower the overall cost of BB satellites. We own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process, either internally or with contract manufacturers, for approximately 95 of the sub-systems planned to be used in our Block 2 BB satellites. We are 
 25 

actively engaged in planning and procurement of materials needed for assembly and readiness of the Block 2 BB satellites to meet our planned launches in 2025 and 2026. Our manufacturing, assembly, and testing strategy includes continuous production and assembly of various components and subsystems for economies of scale, cost efficiencies, and unlocking capacity constraints to complete the final assembly of the Block 2 BB satellites closer to the planned launch timelines. 
 
 We have entered into launch agreements with multiple launch service providers which will enable us to commence a planned launch campaign during 2025 and 2026 to launch up to approximately 45 Block 2 BB satellites, with options available to us for additional launch vehicles, up to a total of approximately 60 Block 2 BB satellites. We have commenced assembling and testing the Block 2 BB satellites in accordance with our plan to meet this launch campaign to enable continuous space-based cellular broadband service coverage across key markets such as the United States, Europe, Japan, the U.S. Government and other strategic markets. We expect to send the first next-generation Block 2 BB satellite to the launch provider in March or April 2025, which will commence our launch campaign of up to an additional approximately 60 Block 2 BB satellites in 2025 through 2026. The timing of these launches is contingent on satisfactory and timely completion of the design, assembly and testing of the Block 2 BB satellites, regulatory approvals, readiness of the launch vehicles, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, logistics, our ability to raise capital for manufacturing of satellites and launch payments, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 We are developing a phased satellite deployment plan and corresponding commercial launch plan of the SpaceMobile Service based on targeted geographical areas to provide the SpaceMobile Service to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. This prioritization of coverage is designed to minimize the capital required to initiate and operate commercial service that generates cash flows from operating activities sooner. We expect that such a successful commercial service would enable us to attract additional capital to continue to assemble and launch additional BB satellites to expand our capacity and geographic coverage area, although there can be no assurance that such capital would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 
 We plan to achieve service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites (five Block 1 BB satellites and 20 Block 2 BB satellites) and achieve substantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites. We anticipate launching and deploying additional satellites beyond the initial 95 satellites in order to enhance coverage and system capacity in response to incremental market demand. Our current plan is subject to numerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including timely supply of materials and components, satisfactory and timely completion of design, assembly and testing of the satellites, availability of launch vehicles aligned with our timeline, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, proposed orbits and resulting satellite coverage, launch costs, ability to enter into agreements with MNOs, regulatory approvals, our ability to raise capital, and other factors. We may adopt a strategy for commercial launch of the SpaceMobile Service, including the nature and type of services offered and the geographic areas where we may launch such services, that may differ materially from our current plan. 
 
 We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. Please refer to Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Quarterly Report. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 2024 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 
 On September 5, 2024, we entered into a new Equity Distribution Agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BofA Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald Co., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the agents to sell shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 400.0 million (the Shares through an at the market offering program under which the agents act as sales agents. The sales of the Shares made under the 2024 Sales Agreement may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. The agents sell the Shares based on our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). Under the 2024 Sales Agreement, the agents are entitled to total compensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the gross sales price per share sold. 
 
 Under the 2024 Sales Agreement, we issued 3,911,053 shares of our Class A Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and received proceeds of 106.9 million, net of commissions paid to the agents and transaction costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid commission of 2.8 million to the agents with respect to such sales and incurred initial transaction costs of 0.4 million. Proceeds from the sale of the Class A Common Stock under the 2024 Sales Agreement were and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes.

Exercises and Redemption of Publicly Traded Warrants Public Warrants 
 
 On August 28, 2024, we announced that we would redeem all of our Public Warrants that remained outstanding at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 27, 2024 (the Redemption Date for a redemption price of 0.01 per warrant. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 13,358,174 Public Warrants were exercised resulting in net proceeds of 153.3 million. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 950,000 Private Placement Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis. On the Redemption Date, a total of 236,294 Public Warrants remained unexercised as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time, and we redeemed those Public Warrants for an aggregate redemption price of 2,363. Following the Redemption Date, we had no Public Warrants outstanding. In connection with the redemption, the Public Warrants ceased trading on the Nasdaq and were delisted. Proceeds from the exercises of Public Warrants were and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Impact of Global Macroeconomic Conditions and Geopolitical Conflicts 
 
 We continue to closely monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policies, higher interest rates, volatility in the capital markets, supply chain challenges, and geopolitical conflicts on all aspects of our business across geographies, including how it has and may continue to impact our operations, workforce, suppliers, and our ability to raise additional capital to fund operating and capital expenditures. 
 
 Changes in the prices of satellite materials due to inflation, supply chain challenges, and other macroeconomic factors, as well as changes in the launch costs, may affect our capital costs estimates to build and launch the satellite constellation and adversely affect our financial condition. The extent of impact of these factors on our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. 
 
 We operate from multiple locations that include our corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet AIT facilities in Texas where the final AIT is performed, and engineering and development centers elsewhere in the United States and in India, Scotland, Spain and Israel. Our operations in Israel constitute approximately 1 of our total assets as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 9 of total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. To date, our operations in Israel have not been materially impacted by the geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. We currently do not expect potential interruptions to our operations in Israel to have a material impact on the Company. 
 
 Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations 
 
 Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to execute on our strategy. We believe that our future results of operations could differ materially from the historical results of operations as we initiate the limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in certain targeted geographical areas, secure contracts with the U.S. government or its prime contractors for non-commercial use of our BB satellites, complete the qualification and assembly of our ASIC chip, complete the development of the Block 2 BB satellites, increase our capacity and scale to manufacture BB satellites, enter into and operate under launch contracts with multiple launch providers, launch the Block 2 BB satellites, and enter into commercial arrangements with MNOs. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 To date, we have not generated any revenues from our SpaceMobile Service and do not expect to generate revenue until we launch the SpaceMobile Service. All revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were generated from completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. Government. We expect to continue to recognize revenue under this agreement throughout 2024 as and when we complete the remaining performance obligations under the agreement. We also expect to generate revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to the MNOs and third parties as and when we complete our performance obligations under these contracts with the customers. 
 
 Engineering Services Costs 
 
 Engineering services costs are charged to expense as incurred. Engineering services costs consist primarily of the cost of employees and consultants involved in the design and development of the BB satellites and fulfillment of performance obligations under contracts with the customers, managing the network and satellite operations centers, indirect costs related to the assembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites, license cost, and general expenses related to AIT facilities and engineering development centers. 
 27 

General and Administrative Costs 
 
 General and administrative costs include the costs of insurance, cost of non-engineering personnel and personnel related expenses, software licensing and subscriptions, office and facilities expenses, investor relations, and professional services, including public relations, accounting and legal fees. 
 
 Research and Development Costs 
 
 R D costs are charged to expense as incurred. R D costs consist principally of development activities in which we typically engage third-party vendors and are largely driven by the achievement of milestones that trigger payments. It also includes costs of materials and supplies consumed in the R D activities such as development of prototype components and subsystems, and production of engineering models to support assembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites. R D costs are expected to fluctuate quarter over quarter depending on achievement of milestones. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation expense related to property and equipment including the BW3 test satellite, as well as definite lived intangible assets. We began depreciating the BW3 test satellite as of April 25, 2023 over its expected remaining useful life of approximately 16 months and it is fully depreciated by August 2024. We expect to begin depreciating the five Block 1 BB satellites on October 29, 2024 over their expected useful life of approximately 60 months. 
 
 Gain (Loss) on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 Public Warrants and private placement warrants Private Placement Warrants issued by us are accounted for as liability-classified instruments at their initial fair value on the date of issuance. They are remeasured at the time of warrant exercises and on each balance sheet date and changes in the estimated fair value are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Interest (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Interest (expense) income, net consists of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debt arrangements, including convertible notes, net of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts. We expect interest expense to decrease in connection with the repayment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Loan (as defined below) on November 13, 2024. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Other income (expense), net primarily consists of non-operating expense and income, including foreign exchange gains or losses. In connection with the repayment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Loan on November 13, 2024, we expect a one-time loss of approximately 11.0 million on extinguishment of debt. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 
 AST LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, all income, losses, and other tax attributes pass through to the members income tax returns, and no U.S. federal and state and local provision for income taxes has been recorded for AST LLC in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain foreign wholly-owned entities are taxed as corporations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and accruals for such taxes are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Noncontrolling Interest 
 
 Noncontrolling interest primarily represents the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than us. As of September 30, 2024, noncontrolling interest in AST LLC was approximately 41.0 . We attribute a portion of net income or loss generated at AST LLC to the noncontrolling interest based on their ownership interests.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were attributable to completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor for a U.S. Government contract, which was entered into in the first quarter of 2024. We had no such agreements in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Engineering Services Costs 
 
 Total engineering services costs increased by 2.3 million, or 12 , to 21.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 2.5 million in payroll and employee related costs, partially offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in AIT facilities and engineering development centers costs, including managing mission operations and ground infrastructure. 
 
 General and Administrative Costs 
 
 Total general and administrative costs increased by 4.6 million, or 41 , to 15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 3.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and other employee related costs and a 1.3 million increase in professional services fees. 
 
 Research and Development Costs 
 
 Total R D costs increased by 5.3 million, or 56 , to 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R D costs was primarily related to the tape-out, which is the final pre-production step, of our ASIC chip. This increase was marginally offset by a decrease in R D costs associated with the completion and launch of the Block 1 BB satellites.

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Total depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 4.5 million, or 24 , to 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the BW3 test satellite being fully depreciated as of August 30, 2024. 
 
 (Loss) gain on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The increase in fair value of warrant liabilities at the time of warrant exercises and the fair value adjustment at September 30, 2024 for Private Placement Warrants resulted in a loss of 236.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely due to redemption of the Public Warrants that resulted in a significant number of Public Warrant exercises as well as a significant increase in our share price. 
 
 Interest (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to interest income, net of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net change of 1.9 million was primarily attributed to an increase of 4.0 million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our debt arrangements, partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Other income, net was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income, net of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net change of 0.9 million was primarily due to a 2.0 million increase in other non-operating income, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase largely due to foreign exchange loss. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 
 The income tax expense was 0.6 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The consolidated effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (0.21) and (0.53) , respectively. Refer to Note 10: Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was 131.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 29.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net loss correlates with the increase in net loss generated at AST LLC given the noncontrolling interest represents a portion of such net loss.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were attributable to completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor for a U.S. Government contract, which was entered into in the first quarter of 2024. We had no such agreements in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Engineering Services Costs 
 
 Total engineering services costs increased by 3.7 million, or 6 , to 62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 4.3 million in AIT facilities and engineering development centers costs including managing mission operations and ground infrastructure and an increase of 1.1 million in travel expenses, partially offset by a 1.7 million decrease in payroll and employee related costs. 
 
 General and Administrative Costs 
 
 Total general and administrative costs increased by 14.6 million, or 47 , to 45.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and other employee related costs, a 0.8 million increase in professional services, a 1.0 million increase in office and facilities expenses, and a 0.4 million increase in travel expenses. 
 
 Research and Development Costs 
 
 Total R D costs decreased by 13.3 million, or 36 , to 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in R D costs were driven by completion of design and development of certain sub systems for the Block 2 BB satellites, completion of certain milestones related to the development of ground infrastructure programs for commercial readiness, and overall completion and launch of the Block 1 BB satellites. While overall R D costs decreased, expenses related to our ASIC chip increased due to the tape-out, which is the final pre-production step of our ASIC chip. 
 31 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Total depreciation and amortization expense increased by 20.0 million, or 57 , to 54.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of the BW3 test satellite depreciation from April 25, 2023. 
 
 (Loss) Gain on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The increase in fair value of warrant liabilities at the time of warrant exercises and the fair value adjustment at quarter end for Private Placement Warrants resulted in a loss of 284.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of 21.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely due to the redemption of the Public Warrants that resulted in a significant number of Public Warrant exercises as well as a significant increase in our share price. 
 
 Interest (Expense) Income, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net was 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the interest income, net of 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net change of 10.1 million was primarily attributed to an increase of 13.2 million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our debt arrangements, partially offset by a 3.1 million increase in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 
 Other income, net was 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other expense, net of 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net change of 11.9 million was primarily due to a nonrecurring 10.0 million payment due to a related party recognized in the first quarter of 2023 and a 4.6 million increase in other non-operating income, partially offset by a 2.2 million increase in loss on disposal of fixed assets and a 0.5 million increase in foreign exchange loss. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 
 The income tax expense was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the income tax benefit of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The consolidated effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (0.25) and 0.28 , respectively. Refer to Note 10: Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was 210.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 89.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net loss correlates with the increase in net loss generated at AST LLC given the noncontrolling interest represents a portion of such net loss. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our current sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and access to the 2024 ATM Equity Program (as described below). As of September 30, 2024, we had 518.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, which included 2.5 million of restricted cash. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we raised a total of 298.2 million in net proceeds from the exercises of Public Warrants (as described below) and the sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock under the 2022 ATM Equity Program (as described below) and the 2024 ATM Equity Program. We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand and our ability to raise capital through access to the 2024 ATM Equity Program will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs, planned operating expenses and capital expenditures for a period of 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 The design, assembly, integration, testing and launch of satellites and related ground infrastructure is capital intensive. As of September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 119.0 million in direct materials and launch costs in connection with the five Block 1 BB satellites launched on September 12, 2024. We currently estimate the average capital costs, consisting of direct materials and launch costs, for a constellation of 90 Block 2 BB satellites to be approximately 19.0 million to 21.0 million per satellite. The increase from previous estimates of 16.0 million to 18.0 million per satellite is driven by higher launch costs based on the recently executed multi-launch services agreements. The estimated average capital cost per Block 2 BB satellite is based on securing future launch contracts with more favorable terms, diversifying our supply chain to include cost-effective and low-cost suppliers, cost reductions due to the benefits of economies of scale, continuous process improvements, and other factors. If we are unable to achieve the supply chain diversifications, 
 32 

cost reductions, process improvements, and secure favorable future launch contracts, the average capital cost of the Block 2 BB satellites will be higher and such variations could be material. 
 
 We believe we need to launch and operate 25 BB satellites (five Block 1 BB satellites and 20 Block 2 BB satellites) in order to provide coverage to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. In addition to the cash and cash equivalents we had on hand as of September 30, 2024, we currently estimate we will need to raise approximately 120.0 million to 170.0 million to meet our current working capital needs including debt repayments, fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to design, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites. We believe the operation of a constellation of 25 BB satellites will enable us to secure additional sources of financing, including potentially generating free cash flows, to fund the buildup of the remaining constellation. Our launch agreements with multiple launch providers enable us to commence a planned launch campaign during 2025 and 2026 to launch up to approximately 45 Block 2 BB satellites, with options available to us for additional launch vehicles, up to a total of approximately 60 Block 2 BB satellites. Subject to our ability to raise additional capital, this provides us with a flexible option to opportunistically accelerate the buildup of the constellation of up to approximately 65 BB satellites (five Block 1 BB satellites and 60 Block 2 BB satellites) needed to enable continuous space-based cellular broadband service coverage across key markets such as the United States, Europe, Japan, the U.S. Government and other strategic markets. 
 
 We evaluate our market, product and coverage plans based upon the attractiveness of certain markets, our technology, regulatory concerns and our access to capital and other resources. We believe we can develop satellite configurations which target delivering service to certain attractive markets without the necessity of building a constellation which covers the entire globe. This modularity of our satellite configuration enables us to alter the timing and size of our satellite roll out and provides us flexibility to dynamically change our market plans and capital requirements. As a result, we believe we have the ability to accelerate or slow down our business plan depending upon the availability of capital to support our strategies. 
 
 We plan to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities (secured or unsecured), secured or unsecured loans or other debt facilities, and credit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners. Our ability to access the capital markets during this period of volatility may require us to modify our current expectations. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed in the future, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Commitments 
 
 Pursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement (as described below) which we entered into with certain investors, we issued subordinated convertible notes (the Convertible Notes for an aggregate principal amount of 110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to AT T Venture Investments, LLC AT T ), Google LLC Google and Vodafone Ventures Limited Vodafone ), and for an aggregate principal amount of 35.0 million on May 23, 2024 to Verizon Communications, Inc. Verizon ). The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2024. The AT T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a 10-year term and the Verizon Convertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted into Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder or us in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Security Investment Agreement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the contractual minimum principal and interest payments required on all of our outstanding debt and operating leases described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, other than above, and the mandatory prepayment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Loan related to raising capital from the issuance of equity interests in excess of the defined threshold as described below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had contractual commitments with third parties in the aggregate amount of 130.7 million related to the procurement of BB satellite components, R D programs, capital improvements, and future launch payments for a Block 2 BB satellite under a certain launch agreement. We entered into additional launch agreements with multi-launch service providers during the fourth quarter of 2024. In accordance with the agreements, the launch payments are payable in installments based on certain milestones, and in certain cases, are contingent upon launch providers meeting certain milestones as defined in the agreements. If the launch providers do not meet these milestones, we have rights to cancel launches or terminate the agreement without incurring a fee. The minimum commitments under these launch agreements are approximately 105.0 million. 
 
 2022 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 
 On September 8, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Sales Agreement or 2022 ATM Equity Program with Evercore Group L.L.C. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the agents to sell shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 150.0 million through an at the market offering program under which the agents acted as sales agents. The agents were entitled to total compensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the gross sales price per share sold. As of 
 33 

September 30, 2024, we have sold shares of our Class A Common Stock up to the authorized amount under the Sales Agreement; accordingly, the Sales Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement were used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 2024 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 
 On September 5, 2024, we entered into a new Equity Distribution Agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement or 2024 ATM Equity Program with B. Riley Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BofA Securities, Inc., Cantor Fitzgerald Co., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the agents to sell shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 400.0 million through an at the market offering program under which the agents will act as sales agents. The agents are entitled to total compensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the gross sales price per share sold. We plan to raise capital, as and when needed, under the 2024 Sales Agreement at our sole discretion. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock under the 2024 Sales Agreement were and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Public Warrants Exercises 
 
 On August 28, 2024, we announced that we would redeem all of our Public Warrants that remained outstanding at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 27, 2024 for a redemption price of 0.01 per warrant. As a result, 13,358,174 Public Warrants were exercised for shares of our Class A Common Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in net proceeds of 153.3 million. Proceeds from the exercise of Public Warrants were used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Term Loan 
 
 In December 2021, concurrent with the purchase of real property and equipment in Midland, Texas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, AST Science Texas, LLC AST Texas ), entered into a credit agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (the Term Loan Credit Agreement providing for a 5.0 million term loan secured by the property. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.20 per annum until December 7, 2026, and from December 8, 2026 until December 8, 2028 at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.20 plus adjustment if the index rate as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement is greater than 4.20 , subject to a maximum interest rate of 4.90 per annum. Refer to Note 5: Long-Term Debt in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, and certain covenants that limit AST Texas ability to, among other things, create liens on collateral, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, and enter into certain transactions with their affiliates. If AST Texas fails to perform its obligations under these and other covenants, or should any event of default occur, the term loan may be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with unpaid accrued interest, could be declared immediately due and payable, and the lender will be authorized to take possession of the collateral. 
 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility Loan 
 
 On August 14, 2023, we entered into a senior secured term loan credit agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC as administrative agent and collateral agent and Atlas Credit Partners, LLC Atlas as lender, providing for a principal loan commitment of up to 100.0 million (the Atlas Credit Agreement ), of which 48.5 million was borrowed upon closing. 
 
 The initial borrowing of 48.5 million accrued interest at a fixed rate equal to the three-month secured overnight financing rate SOFR as of the closing date plus 9.625 per annum equal to 14.75 (the Atlas Fixed Rate ), payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. 
 
 The borrowing amounts are payable at maturity on August 14, 2026 and are subject to mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including raising capital from issuance of equity interests in excess of certain threshold as defined in the Atlas Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the mandatory prepayment event related to raising capital from issuance of equity interests in excess of the defined threshold was triggered. On November 13, 2024, we repaid the principal amount, including the exit fee, call premium and accrued interest aggregating to approximately 54.9 million. 
 
 34 

Capital Equipment Loan 
 
 On August 14, 2023, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Star as lender, providing for a 15.0 million principal term loan commitment secured by certain real property fixtures and equipment in one of our Texas facilities (the Lone Star Loan Agreement ). 
 
 Borrowings accrue interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.75 , subject to a ceiling rate. Interest payments are due and payable on a monthly basis. Interest payments began in September 2023 and principal payments will begin in April 2025. Principal repayments are thereafter due in 48 equal monthly installments until January 2029, the maturity date of the loan. In connection with the Lone Star Loan Agreement, we deposited a cash balance of 15.0 million in the Lone Star Bank Money Market Fund. This cash balance will be converted to restricted cash if we fail to maintain a consolidated balance of cash and cash equivalents of at least 75.0 million. This restricted cash will be used to offset against the term loan obligations if we fail to maintain a consolidated balance of cash and cash equivalents of at least 50.0 million. In addition, the Lone Star Loan Agreement includes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants. 
 
 We drew the entire 15.0 million facility on September 19, 2023 and incurred 0.1 million of transaction costs. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Convertible Security Investment Agreement 
 
 Pursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement which we entered into with certain investors, we issued Convertible Notes for an aggregate principal amount of 110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to AT T, Google, and Vodafone, and for an aggregate principal amount of 35.0 million on May 23, 2024 to Verizon. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2024. We have the option to pay interest on the Convertible Notes in cash or in kind. We elected to pay interest on the Convertible Notes in kind on June 30, 2024, resulting in the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being increased by approximately 3.0 million. Interest will accrue on such increased principal amount in subsequent interest periods. The AT T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a 10-year term unless earlier converted and the Verizon Convertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted. The net proceeds of the Convertible Notes were and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 The Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of 5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock). The Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option on the Conversion Date, which is on or after January 16, 2025. On or after the Conversion Date, we may require the Holders to convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of 5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock) at our option, if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for 30 consecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period. The Convertible Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default and fundamental change.

 Financing activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 620.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 117.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 503.0 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to an additional 81.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of debt, including convertible notes, 153.3 million increase in proceeds from exercise of Public Warrants, a 268.6 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of Class A Common Stock from public offerings and under the 2022 and 2024 ATM Equity Program and a 0.4 million net decrease related to stock-based compensation awards. 
 
 Impact of inflation 
 
 While inflation may impact our capital and operating expenditures, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future, including by heightened levels of inflation experienced globally as a consequence of the rapidly changing market and economic conditions. 
 
 Funding Requirements 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months from the date hereof. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 
 36 

Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 Establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support our satellite development; 

Technological or manufacturing difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters; 

Negotiation of launch agreements (including launch costs), launch delays or failures, deployment failures, or in-orbit satellite failures; 

Seeking and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals; 

Timing of the launch of our satellites and subsequent initiation of service in various markets, delays in which will result in increased operating expenses; 

Addressing any competing technological and market developments; 

Ability to adjust our expenditures and contractual commitments based on capital availability; 

Ability to operate under the covenants in our debt agreements; and 

Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and commercial and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of stockholders will be, or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 
 
 If we raise funds through commercial agreements, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies and/or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Also, our ability to raise necessary financing could be impacted by recent geopolitical events, higher interest rates and inflationary economic conditions and their effects on the market conditions. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity offerings, debt financings or commercial arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market other services even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market these services ourselves or potentially discontinue operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qu alitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Contro ls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 38 

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of any recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to Note 7: Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Delaware Class Action Litigations 
 
 Following books and records demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. 220, two stockholders filed putative class action complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company, certain current and former directors and officers of the Company and its predecessor entity and manager, New Providence Acquisition Corp. and New Providence Management LLC, and Abel Avellan, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting such breaches, and unjust enrichment, relating to the de-SPAC merger. The first of those complaints, Taylor v. Coleman, et al. (C.A. No. 2023-1292), was filed on December 27, 2023, and the second, Drulias v. New Providence Management LLC, et al., was filed on March 29, 2024 (collectively, the Delaware Stockholder Class Actions ). On March 15, 2024, prior to the filing of the Drulias action, the defendants had moved to dismiss the Taylor action. On April 29, 2024, the court entered a stipulation by the parties to both actions to be consolidated under the caption In re AST SpaceMobile, Inc. Stockholders Litigation (C.A. No. 2023-1292), and for the plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint by May 29, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on May 29, 2024, which asserts the same claims and seeks the same damages equitable relief and unspecified monetary damages. On July 15, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The court has scheduled a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss for February 3, 2025. 
 
 Federal Class Action Litigations 
 
 The Company and certain of its current executive officers have been named as defendants in a putative stockholder class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Klarkowski v. AST SpaceMobile, Inc., No. 7:24-cv-00102-DC-RCG (W.D. Tex.) (the Securities Class Action ). The complaint in the Securities Class Action, which was filed on April 17, 2024, alleges that defendants violated the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions relating to the status and timeline of satellite production, and that the current executive officers named as defendants are control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint is filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased shares of the Company s common stock between November 14, 2023 and April 1, 2024 Class Period ), and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the purported class. On July 9, 2024, the Court appointed a Lead Plaintiff for the putative class and approved his choice of Lead Counsel. On September 9, 2024, the Lead Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the Securities Class Action without prejudice. 
 
 The Company has been named as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors have been named as defendants in a derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Hanna v. Avellan, et al., No. 7:24-cv-00171-DC-RCG (W.D. Tex.) (the Derivative Action ). The complaint in the Derivative Action, which was filed on July 23, 2024, asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Exchange Act against all defendants and claims for contribution under the federal securities laws against certain of the defendants. The parties filed an Agreed Motion for Voluntary Dismissal, which the court granted on October 16, 2024. 
 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 
 For a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, please refer to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as specified below. 
 
 We will need to raise additional funds for continued operations and to initiate our planned SpaceMobile Service. These funds may not be available to us when we need them on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed in the future, our financial condition and prospects will be negatively affected. 
 39 

We will need to raise significant additional capital for operating and capital expenditures to design, assemble and launch our Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation needed to provide continuous global cellular broadband service coverage. 
 We currently estimate the average capital costs, consisting of direct materials and launch costs, for a constellation of 90 Block 2 BB satellites to be approximately 19.0 million to 21.0 million per satellite. We have entered into launch agreements with multiple launch service providers which will enable us to commence a planned launch campaign during 2025 and 2026 to launch up to approximately 45 Block 2 BB satellites, with options available to us for additional launch vehicles, up to a total of approximately 60 Block 2 BB satellites. While launch agreements for our satellites are critical in facilitating our ability to provide the SpaceMobile Service, these contracts and future contracts, once executed, increase our financial risks significantly. 
 We intend to seek to raise additional capital to fund the design, assembly and launch of our constellation and operation of the commercial services through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities (secured or unsecured), secured or unsecured loans or other debt facilities, and credit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners, including through our existing 2024 ATM Equity Program. 
 
 Our ability to access the capital markets during this period of volatility may require us to modify our current expectations. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed in the future, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected, including as a result of the need to cancel launch agreements and related incurrence of significant termination fees to cancel those launch contracts.

The Plan, the Grant Notice and this Agreement (including any exhibit hereto) constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Participant with respect to the subject matter hereof. To the extent permitted by the Plan, this Agreement may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Administrator or the Board; provided, however, that except as may otherwise be provided by the Plan, no amendment, modification, suspension or termination of this Agreement shall materially and adversely affect the RSUs without the prior written consent of Participant.

In the event that any provision of the Grant Notice or this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the provision will be severable from, and the illegality or invalidity of the provision will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of the Grant Notice or this Agreement.
