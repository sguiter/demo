Domestic sales for the quarter were 36,409,000, up 6.5 when compared to sales of 34,185,000 in the comparable period of the prior year. Domestic sales increased when compared to the prior year primarily due to higher product demand. International sales for the quarter were 11,355,000, down 30.1 when compared to sales of 16,251,000 in the comparable period of the prior year. International sales decreased when compared to the prior year period due to customer construction site delays in India which pushed out the timing of deliveries. 
 Sales for the six months ended October 31, 2024 were 96,157,000, a decrease from sales of 100,275,000 in the comparable period of the prior year. Domestic sales for the period were 71,932,000, up 3.3 from sales of 69,605,000 in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in Domestic sales was primarily driven by higher product demand. International sales for the period were 24,225,000, down 21.0 from sales of 30,670,000 in the comparable period of the prior year. International sales decreased when compared to the prior year period due to customer construction site delays in India which pushed out the timing of deliveries.

The Company's order backlog was 184.4 million at October 31, 2024, as compared to 146.3 million at October 31, 2023, and 155.6 million at April 30, 2024. 
 The gross profit margin for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 29.2 of sales, as compared to 26.7 of sales in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The gross profit margin for the six month ended October 31, 2024 was 27.5 of sales, as compared to 25.3 of sales in the comparable quarter of the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin percentage for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily driven by enhanced manufacturing productivity, effective cost-containment measures, and continued benefits related to the Company's strategic go-to-market decision, made in a prior fiscal year, to stop selling direct. 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 9,518,000, or 19.9 of sales, as compared to 8,359,000, or 16.6 of sales, in the comparable period of the prior year. Operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2024 were 19,431,000, or 20.2 of sales, as compared to 16,465,000 or 16.4 of sales, in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in consulting and professional fees of 1,241,000, and corporate governance expenses of 335,000 partially offset by decreases in international operating expenses of 434,000, SG A wages, benefit, incentive and stock-based compensation of 168,000, and bad debt expense of 48,000. The increase in operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in consulting and professional fees of 1,853,000, SG A wages, benefits, incentive and stock-based compensation of 563,000, corporate governance expenses of 368,000, and depreciation expense of 28,000, partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense of 162,000 and international operating expenses of 138,000. The increases in consulting and professional fees for both the three- and six-month periods were primarily attributed to one-time costs associated with the acquisition of Nu Aire and costs incurred related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b) compliance readiness. 
 Interest expense was 442,000 and 914,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to 372,000 and 802,000, respectively, for the comparable periods of the prior year. The changes in interest expense were due to changes in the levels of bank borrowings and interest rates. 
 Income tax expense of 916,000 and 2,015,000 was recorded for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense of 1,108,000 and 2,912,000 was recorded for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 was 23.3 and 17.4 , as compared to 41.6 and 35.3 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the current three and six months periods reflects the impact of foreign operations which are taxed at different rates than the U.S. tax rate of 21 , combined with expected current year tax expense for the Company's domestic operations. In addition, the income tax expense recorded for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was favorably impacted by a discrete tax benefit of 421,000 resulting from the issuance of stock through the vesting of restricted stock units and the exercise of stock options during the first quarter. See Note L , Income Taxes , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Non-controlling interests related to the Company's subsidiaries not 100 owned by the Company decreased net earnings by 7,000 and 52,000 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to 98,000 and 139,000, respectively, for the comparable periods of the prior year. The change in the net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest in the current period was due to changes in earnings (losses) of the subsidiaries in the related period. 
 Net earnings was 3,008,000, or 1.01 per diluted share, for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to net earnings of 2,732,000, or 0.93 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net earnings was 5,201,000, or 1.75 per diluted share, for the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to net earnings of 5,206,000, or 1.79 per diluted share, in the prior year period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities, supplemented as needed by borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, certain machinery and equipment are financed by non-cancellable operating and financing leases. The Company believes that these sources will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements in the current fiscal year, including capital expenditures. 
 The Company had working capital of 59,965,000 at October 31, 2024, compared to 56,037,000 at April 30, 2024. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6-to-1.0 at October 31, 2024, compared to 2.4-to-1.0 at April 30, 2024. 
 The Company's operating activities provided cash of 7,642,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, primarily from operations, decreases in receivables of 3.2 million, decreases in inventories of 2.0 million, and increases in deferred revenue 
 15 

of 1.9 million, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of 3.9 million and the change in other, net of 2.0 million, of which 1.1 million related to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. During the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company used net cash of 961,000 in investing activities, all of which was used for capital expenditures. The Company's financing activities used cash of 2,886,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, primarily related to the termination of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility on September 30, 2024. See Note F , Long-term Debt and Other Credit Arrangements , for more details. On November 1, 2024, the Company entered into a new Loan Agreement and issued Seller Notes as part of the acquisition of Nu Aire. See Note P , Subsequent Events , for more details. 
 
 Outlook 
 The Company's ability to predict future demand for its products continues to be limited given its role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors. Demand for the Company's products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and/or current progress in projects already under construction. The Company's earnings are also impacted by fluctuations in prevailing pricing for projects in the laboratory construction marketplace and costs of raw materials, including steel, wood, and epoxy resin. 
 The Company continues to focus on supporting its dealers and distribution channel partners domestically while continuing to provide turnkey solutions in the international markets it serves. The acquisition of Nu Aire further presents a unique opportunity for Kewaunee to expand its capabilities and presence domestically. The improved focus of the organization, combined with the acquisition of Nu Aire, a strong global management team, a healthy backlog, improved manufacturing capabilities, and end-use markets that continue to prioritize investment in projects that require the products Kewaunee designs and manufactures, positions the Company well.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There are no material changes to the disclosures made on this matter in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 16 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of October 31, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective and designed to ensure that all material information required to be filed in this quarterly report is made known to them by others within the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 (b) Changes in internal controls 
 There was no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors," any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company's actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from its past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. There have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors from those set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024 beyond those set forth below. 
 We have recently acquired Nu Aire, Inc. ("Nu Aire"), which was not subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), and may therefore lack the internal controls that would be required of a U.S. public company, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 We have recently acquired Nu Aire, Inc., which was not previously subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley and accordingly was not required to establish and maintain an internal control infrastructure meeting the standards promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley. Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 did not include consideration of the controls of Nu Aire, which was acquired on November 1, 2024. 
 Although management will continue to review and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls in light of this acquisition, we cannot provide any assurances that there will be no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any significant deficiency or material weakness in the internal control structure of our acquired business may cause significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to comply with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 We may not be able to realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the Nu Aire acquisition. 
 On November 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Nu Aire. The success of this acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining Nu Aire with our existing business. Achieving these benefits depends on the timely, efficient, and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the acquired business into the Company. Factors that could affect our ability to achieve these benefits include: 
 Difficulties in integrating and managing personnel, financial reporting, and other systems used by the acquired business; 
 The failure of the acquired business to perform in accordance with our expectations; 
 Failure to achieve anticipated synergies between our business units and the business units of the acquired business; 
 The loss of customers of the acquired business; 
 The loss of key managers and employees of the acquired business; or 
 Other material adverse events in the acquired business. 
 The process of integrating Nu Aire into our existing operations also may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Costs associated with the acquisition have included and may include in the future significant transaction, consulting, and third-party service fees as we build up internal resources and/or engage third party providers as part of the integration of Nu Aire into our operations. Further, because Nu Aire was a private company and was not subject to the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, the Nu Aire acquisition requires or will require us to incorporate additional internal controls for the acquired company, which may be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Although we expect to successfully integrate Nu Aire, we may not achieve the desired net benefit in the timeframe planned if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than anticipated. If the acquired company does not operate as we anticipate, it could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 None. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The Company's share repurchase program was adopted on August 31, 2023. The Company did not purchase any shares under its share repurchase program during the three months ended October 31, 2024. The share repurchase program had remaining authorization of 33,809 shares as of October 31, 2024. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers 
 Transactions in the Company's securities by its directors or executive officers are required to be made in accordance with its Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, requires that the transaction be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in the possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides an affirmative defense that enables prearranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. 
 During the six months ended October 31, 2024, of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) informed the Company of the adoption or termination of a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
